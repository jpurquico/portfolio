Jess S.,2021-07-05,5,Everything from the atmosphere to the service presentation of food prices and amazing flavours is TOP NOTCH This place is incredible We made reservations for Saturday for 5:30 and we were sat and served immediately Our server Calen was so friendly and very efficient His patience was incredible We had a toddler with us and he was able to navigate through the menu to help us sort out an appropriate meal My friend settled on Agedashi Tofu GF fried tofu sticky orange ginger sauce dry for the kid Dan Dan Noodles spicy dan dan sauce farro gai lan peanuts with sauce on the side and Mushroom + Sausage Tagliatelle GF OPT +3 pistachio pesto cream parmesan garlic bread wedge  no bread to make it GF Food was so well presented Service sizes are perfect The dan dan sauce was spicy and INCREDIBLE My pasta was really good and full of mushrooms as well I wish I got the Romesco Vodka Pasta but I am so looking forward to returning We also ordered Peanut Butter Cup Pie GF puffed crisps chocolate ganache maldon and it was hella good Perfection We also ordered their house wine Indigenous World Winery Red Blend  which complimented the meal perfectly Definitely coming back,MILA Plant-Based
Arlene B.,2021-10-03,4,You dont have to be vegan to appreciate the food experience at Mila restaurant I must admit that I was initially sceptical about how much I would enjoy this restaurant as I so often include meat as part of my diet But I was wrong and genuinely enjoyed my food My sister and I came to pick up food for lunch The restaurant has a polished feel from the chair line angles that echo in the tile work The staff at the front of house was attentive and helpful in terms of suggesting some of the most popular menu items and advising against certain items that might not be suitable for takeout eg ice cream We ordered the Mila roll the pistachio cream and sausage tagliatelle the bulgogi tacos and the peanut butter pie The Mila roll was served with the sauce on the side which I appreciated as Im not a huge fan of wasabi The roll itself was fresh and tasty I didnt try the bulgogi taco but my family members who have had it before have raved about them I thoroughly enjoyed the pistachio cream and sausage tagliatelle The sausage had characteristic fennel flavour and a meaty texture The pistachio cream and vegan grated cheese added the perfect amount of creaminess and cheesiness to the dish I in no way felt like I was missing out on meat or cheese in this dish The peanut butter pie alas melted somewhat during transport so we put it in the fridge to solidify Even if you are a meat eater Mila could possibly convince you to occasionally eat and enjoy a plant based meal I would definitely come back here,MILA Plant-Based
Poonam M.,2021-08-08,4,This the old Juniper so the layout is the same We had Bao smash burger Dan Dan noodles mushroom and sausage tagliatelle and peach cobbler All phenomenal Hands down the best vegan food I have had So so good The service Not so good My noodles did not come until I had asked for it twice The glass of wine my friend ordered never came About three different times we were offered food that we did not ask for...so the front staff a hot mess The chef clearly knows what they are doing I would recommend this place only bc the food is outstanding Just manage your expectations regarding getting your food on time,MILA Plant-Based
Suzan L.,2021-06-26,1,Very disappointing experience The Sakura cocktail tasted awful floral in all the wrong ways  it was so bad that I didnt even want to drink it after 2 sips When I bought this up with the server he just shrugged and told me that I can get a different drink next time Wow is this really what to expect from a higher scale restaurant like this It took forever for the food we ordered to come out How does it take over 30 min to make 6 pieces of sushi for one The coconut curry noodles were awful It was so salty it was almost inedible My friends dandan noodles were so much better However the dishes were lukewarm by the time we received them Makes me wonder if they were just sitting there Overall a complete disappointment I paid over 50 for bad food bad drinks and bad service,MILA Plant-Based
Sangeetha M.,2021-05-05,4,I ordered for delivery so I cant comment on the actual restaurant I was excited to try this restaurant because a lot of people mentioned how amazing it is But I was quite reluctant because it is more on the pricey side and I always find it a little odd to pay for vegetarian food more than or as much as I would pay for meat or seafood After trying the food I stand by this Good food but too expensive for what it is IMO I tried the mushroom and sausage tagliatelle It was a big filling portion and it felt like I had meat Really hit the spot Desert  I tried the peanut butter cup pie I shared this with a friend and one slice was way too much for the both of us Its really good as if youre having Reeses peanut butter cups but it also got to be way too rich and too much I must say that it looks beautiful though with the gold and some crunchy bits,MILA Plant-Based
Celina L.,2021-08-12,5,I know the thought of vegan food can scare off people but as someone who is not vegan this place was TOP TIER The ambience inside gave me high-end Gastown restaurant vibes especially with how stunning the bar was and how the space was designed The food Im telling you you cant even tell anything was vegan The aburi oshi tasted close to the real thing because of the vegan mayo PLEASE get the smashed potatoes Its so addicting The Mila roll had heart of palm in it Who knew a forgotten ingredient like that could make something taste sooo good Please go check it out with your vegan friends or with your non vegan friends Im definitely going to go back and take my bf there ,MILA Plant-Based
Tasfia T.,2021-08-15,5,We came here just for dessert since they are open late and I am glad we did All the desserts were excellent I would highly recommend the peanut butter cup pie Cant wait to come back here for dinner,MILA Plant-Based
Pam C.,2021-02-16,4,MILA is right beside Bao Bei formerly Juniper MILA was very busy the night we visited We had reservations but we werent seated at a nice spot Our server was nice and I didnt mind waiting a little longer as they were pretty busy I ordered Aburi sushi and the tagliatelle They used carrots as fish which I thought was fantastic It tasted really good with the melting cheese atop It made me chuckle in my head when I tasted the carrot as I thought in my head Omg that is so vegan Haha The Pesto Tagliatelle was amazing Even the bread I am not really into crunchy bread but this was had flavour in it so I ate the whole entire thing I love pasta in general and this was one great We loved the Broccolini so much that we ordered two It was the best thing we had on our first visit We will come back again to try other dishes,MILA Plant-Based
Matt B.,2021-02-14,5,Vegan brunch doesnt get much better than this Weve been wanting to try this place since it opened We ordered some brunch for take-out around noon and it was ready within 25 minutes I ordered the tempeh rib hash 16 and my wife got the breakfast sandwich 18  both were pretty magnificent Tempeh rib hash this comes with perfectly roasted potatoes tempeh wild mushrooms tofu scramble avocado roast veg and arugula with a wonderful sauce The flavours and textures were just incredible Very filling 5/5 Breakfast sandwich pretty decadent sandwich with sausage tofu scramble cheese avocado etc served with smashed potatoes Almost too decadent and extremely feeling Very tasty 4.5/5 Overall though its on the pricier side the quality clearly matches and the portions are generous Looking forward to returning to try other items on both their brunch and other menus Highly recommended,MILA Plant-Based
Olivia C.,2021-11-20,5,DELICIOUS the bao appetizer was so so good i will definitely be coming back the dessert was great as well,MILA Plant-Based
Doris H.,2021-01-31,5,Ive ordered from Mila a few times before on UberEats and I was beyond impressed each time I got to go in person today and still does not disappoint First things first I am not a vegan but I love trying plant based foods The first time I ordered the Aburi Lox Oshi Sushi I was blown away as I truly could not tell the difference and the texture felt so close to the actual thing Today I ordered the Bento Lunch which came with the Kuri Curry Soup Yam Tempura and a choice of a half sushi roll of the Aburi Lox Oshi or the Mila Roll and of course I went for the Aburi Lox since its got such amazing flavour It only came to 12 It was definitely enough to feed me but I definitely could have eaten more if I wanted to I also got the Isla Nublar cocktail which is dangerous since Im obsessed with it now and the Sakura cocktail which has an edible flower in it Super cute My friend ordered the fish n chips and she has been a vegetarian for a loooong time and said that it was awesome We are definitely coming back here again,MILA Plant-Based
Elvi R.,2020-10-27,5,I had been waiting a while to go check out MILA Was so happy that I decided to go here for my birthday dinner It did not disappoint Before I even got to the restaurant I looked at the menu and already had a hard time ordering since everything sounded so good We finally decided to get the Bao Buns the Tagliatelle the Bulgogi tacos and the carrot lox oshi Everything was AH-MAZING 10/10 for all the dishes I ordered The one little thing that bugged me a little was the price for the Oshi I did find it a little on the pricey side especially cause theres no fish in it So I dont think that I would order that again Other than that I cant wait to go back to try more items on their menu,MILA Plant-Based
Jill N.,2020-11-11,5,Some of the best vegan food Ive ever had We had an amazing bottle of little Engine Chardonnay recommended by the sommelier who was very knowledgeable and patient with us The Aburi sushi was to die for as well as the mushroom toast The boa buns were very tasty too Burger was top notch and the Harvest Salad and Tagliatelle was also phenomenal Highly recommend,MILA Plant-Based
Coco L.,2021-10-24,5,Such a good brunch spot Everyones meals were fire and the mimosa flight was awesome 10/10 recommend,MILA Plant-Based
Kristie W.,2020-09-28,4,I was too excited when I caught word of a new vegan place that served not only usual burgers wraps and buddha bowls On my first visit I tried the Salmon Lox Oshi bao buns and sausage pesto tagliatelle The salmon oshi looks exactly like a Miku style salmon oshi and it pretty well tastes identical except for the fact that a slice of carrot replaces the usual torched salmon The bao buns contain a thick serving of tempeh that is surprisingly tender and picks up the flavors of the two sauces used in the bun The pesto tagliatelle was yummy and you just about forget that the sausage is plant-based Overall the dishes have no flaws but they are not particularly novel or mind blowing Their cocktails menu looks awesome as well Still the meal ends up being rather pricey for casual dining roughly 60 after tax and tip for 2 appies and a main without any drinks Cocktails are about 15 a piece You also need to make a reservation well in advance even for a party of two and especially on a weekend,MILA Plant-Based
Leeza N.,2021-07-20,4,Finally got the chance to try Mila for a late lunch yesterday since they were open for indoor dining The tables inside are very spacious and clean there is also a huge bar as well The servers were very nice and informative about the menu I decided to get the smashed chips and the mila roll and my friend got a kale caesar salad since shes allergic to eggs this was her first time trying a caesar salad The smashed chips came out first and they were SO GOOD It was kind of like home style fries that you get at brunch but more crunchier and flavourful due to the miso garlic butter and it came with a sambal ginger aioli sauce which tasted so amazing tasted kind of like chipotle sauce without the smokiness Next my mila roll and my friends kale caesar salad came out The mila roll was plated so nicely with drizzles of wasabi mango mayo and crunchy toppings The roll itself consisted of avocado cucumber and heart of palm mix which resembled the texture of unagi It was so delicious I honestly didnt even feel like it was plant based My friends kale caesar salad was so good as well the dressing was amazing and the kale leaves were not too salty at all My friend also got a cocktail yesterday and she said it was so good but I forgot the name To finish off our meal we ordered the churros to share The churros were garnished with pistachios and a rose cardamom syrup As much as they were delicious the churros were TINY and for 8 I expected to get long churros but it was very small and a bit dissapointing which is why I had to take off a star because everything else portion wise was amazing I definitely will return to Mila with my vegan friends soon to try other items on their menu,MILA Plant-Based
Cherry W.,2021-03-08,4,They have a max 2 hour sitting and everything is partitioned Quite cute aesthetic The food that I had tried was really yummy but definitely on the pricer side The portions are smaller which is why I gave them 4 stars I saw a lot of people getting drinks and tasting trays so maybe that is why their portions are smaller If you are looking for a place/brunch to fill you up I dont know if this is the place for you Their Aburi Lox is really something else and I totally recommend getting it The way they treat the carrot is fantastic to be like salmon If you like Aburi sushi but dont like the fishy taste of salmon this is for you The Crab Benedict is good However with the soft tofu as the egg and the hollandaise sauce it really overpowers/overshadows the crab which I really couldnt taste With the price point I dont know if it is really worth it I wish they gave more smashed potatoes,MILA Plant-Based
Chloe C.,2021-02-08,5,Was disappointed by my first brunch visit but my second visit was much better Glad I gave their brunch a second chance Tempeh Rib Hash 5/5 Amazing crispy potatoes with tempeh mushrooms and tofu scramble topped with a delicious and creamy gochujang mayo  whats not to love Crab Cake Benedict 5/5 The crab cake was the star of the show It was so delicious Ive never had hearts of palm before but now Im sold The tofu egg was okay but the hollandaise could be creamier and the flavour needs some adjustment The side crispy potatoes are literal crack  Breakfast Baos 4/5 The bao was fluffy and the sambal aioli was creamy and flavourful The textures were a bit one dimensional and the tofu scramble with the bao was quite tasteless once you run out of aioli The bacun was a nice touch but the strip was way too tiny The buns needed more aioli and double the bacun Quiche 2.5/5 This was a soggy unattractive mess Looked nothing like the pictures No pie crust at all which is the best part The dill yoghurt was not good and almost ruined the whole dish It was just a pile of tofu scramble with some unseasoned carrots Not impressed PBJ Waffles 1/5 Another dish which fell way short of my expectations Definitely not worth the hype The only good thing was that the waffles were crispy and the peanut butter was tasty The waffles had a weird rosemary/thyme flavour that did not work with the other components of the dish The amount of peanut butter was abysmal just a drizzle and the whole dish was just a bunch of confusing flavours Definitely get the hash and the crab cake benny and maybe the breakfast baos Would skip the other items,MILA Plant-Based
Nicole B.,2021-02-03,4,Recently learned about this spot through the juice truck I was enticed by all the wonderful pictures on IG and was needing a new plant based spot in the mix I think the photos speak for themselves Gluten friendly options and I was able to steer clear from seitan I enjoyed this moderately priced  clean environment,MILA Plant-Based
Bekah H.,2021-10-10,1,So disappointed All the food looked so good but everything had such a weird taste The Romesco pasta was ok but the veggies accompanying it had a strong stringent taste that made me gag The bao buns also looked appetizing but the tempeh was flavored in an odd way I really cant describe what it is making these dishes off but I was surprised it was as bad as it was Even the peanut butter cup pie wasnt anything to rave about Looked nice but was just meh,MILA Plant-Based
Becky T.,2021-08-02,5,The pho is yummy Broth is very flavorful and lots of veggies and some tofu Will be back to try the other items,Lotus Seed Vegan
Charly S.,2021-05-12,5,I stopped here specifically for the Vegan Benny a month or so ago and Im happy to report it met my craving and was very tasty and hit the spot I also tried the chaga tea latte and I really enjoyed it The food was well prepared and well presented The owners are lovely kind and welcoming I also bought the plant based omelette mix to take home and I really enjoyed the flavour/texture if you pick it up remember to follow the directions carefully I didnt and I could see in hindsight the errors of my ways  haha  but it was still very tasty,Lotus Seed Vegan
Donna D.,2020-12-03,4,In need of a sit down meal after running around Broadway Lotus Seed is a vegans choice spot I came here for lunch again after a day of errands and shopping We were greeted and got safely seated in a distanced table My partner and I ordered the baked spring rolls a meatless ball sandwich vietnamese coffee and a macaroon Everything was delish We split both meals to try each and were very satisfied with our choice The meatless ball sandwich was filling a light it was perfectly dosed in sauce so nothing was dry about it If Im in the area and have time for sit down vegan Id def visit again,Lotus Seed Vegan
Lily D.,2021-07-29,5,I love this restaurant My favourite dish so far is the poke bowl I also really love the blue flame smoothie Everything Ive tried so far is so delicious Definitely one of my favourite restaurants,Lotus Seed Vegan
Gurpreet S.,2021-10-24,1,I am very surprised that this place has close to five stars My husband and I came in 40 minutes prior to closing hoping to find some vegetarian friendly food As we walked in and before we could say anything we were told that they were about to close that if we wanted anything it needs to be take out We went ahead and ordered some food The kitchen is visible from the front of the restaurant and the preparation was not sanitary The cashier helped make food and did not wash her hands she touched every item of food with her bare hands The food was also bland we ordered the Benedict just mushrooms and avocado on half burnt bread and pho tasteless For the money that they charge their food is very subpar,Lotus Seed Vegan
Chloe C.,2021-06-10,4,Their poke bowl is very flavourful with many components but could use more chipotle mayo and toppings as I was left with a lot of brown rice and quinoa at the end The thai curry wasnt my favourite as it was quite sweet due to the pineapple and had a pretty strong pineapple flavour The rice noodles also clumped together a little bit Id go with the poke bowl but not the curry A good place to grab a quick healthy meal,Lotus Seed Vegan
Fernanda G.,2020-10-21,5,This restaurant serves some of the most delicious food I tried in Vancouver I know most of their ingredients are organic and everything is made from scratch,Lotus Seed Vegan
Spring C.,2020-08-06,4,So happy to have found BAKED spring rolls I just wish they came with peanut sauce or a little more sauce  I always run out of sauce before the roll runs out I am happy that this place  at least with the dishes Ive tried  doesnt use fake meats My patties in the soup were made from seeds nuts beans  much healthier Thank you very grateful for a real vegan restaurant with real food,Lotus Seed Vegan
Ayaka H.,2018-11-29,5,Ive been searching for Vegan Asian cuisine in an all vegan establishment and Im happy to announce that Ive found one that I can rave about to everyone I naturally prefer food that isnt deep fried whenever possible so their baked spring rolls stood out at me Although it lacked the crisp of a traditional spring roll it was still bursting with flavour and the fresh variety of veg fillings made it healthy Their winner however was their Thai curry see pic  Oh my goodness if I could have their recipe Id make it all the time seriously I dont think Ive had better Thai curry anywhere else in the city Will I return Yes of course Im anticipating my next visit already Tip casual atmosphere good for quick lunches,Lotus Seed Vegan
Nicole B.,2019-09-17,1,I ordered the yellow curry dish and was thoroughly disappointed It had too much carrots and corn in it and the veg didnt taste fresh The plate was also dirty The spring rolls are baked very dry The cilantro looked old that was on the other dish When I spoke to the owner she was surprised but in the end I was reimbursed for the dish I did not enjoy the food here they menu is weird and has some pasta dishes and Vietnamese dishes it was all over the place and didnt really have a vibe that matched the name Food is sub-par lacking flavour and lukewarm,Lotus Seed Vegan
Carolyn L.,2018-06-13,4,The Thai curry was really delicious I ordered it to go and had them separate the rice noodle from the curry The portion of rice noodle looked small but it was actually a lot Looks were deceiving For non-vegans/vegetarians I jazzed up the curry by adding roast chicken meat to it when I got back That was amazing The curry was great on rice too I think I may start doing that Order the dishes to go so that I can add meat/seafood to complement the meal,Lotus Seed Vegan
Pam C.,2018-03-20,5,It has been MONTHS since I wanted to try this place and finally last night a friend who is a regular brought me here to eat some delicious vegetarian dishes The owners are Buddhists and theyre super nice Its a clean and humble restaurant near a park and a ten-minute walk from Joyce-Collingwood skytrain station I ordered their famous Thai curry with rice noodle and my friend ordered the spaghetti with Alfredo sauce Both dishes came in massive bowls with a lot of food So be careful and dont waste anything The Thai curry is flavourful and mildly spicy It is worth trying if you are in the area or want to eat some delicious vegetarian dish I had a small taste of the spaghetti with Alfredo sauce and it was really good too However it is something anyone can make at home so Id stick with my Thai curry when I come back again next time There are some parking right outside the restaurant but if its full you can go to the underground parking that is less than a minute walk away,Lotus Seed Vegan
Lauren L.,2018-12-30,5,Theres something to be said for a really good steak but honestly folks The more you all rave how you cant eat pansy vegetarian food or it just doesnt fill you up or its rabbit or girl food Sure give me those excuses but when you get clogged arteries from heavy meat and fat and a sedentary lifestyle dont come to me Im not your doctor Poor soul the doctor not you The steak lovers out there sure lets just eat steak and lobster all day but honestly what your body really needs is this place The food they make here is made with love and care and your colon and the rest of your body especially the heart will love you for it 5 stars for everything here I just wish we could have them closer to where I live ,Lotus Seed Vegan
Matt B.,2019-05-17,3,Updating my review for the new location The place is comfortable and casual Large menu now that runs the gamut from Asian mostly Vietnamese cuisine to brunch items and many other items I tried the vegan pho which was only decent  lacked flavour but was a decent portion The prices are quite high now 13.95++ for the pho which is quite a bit higher than most other places in town for a vegan pho I also dont like their embrace of pseudoscientific nonsense they use Kangen alkaline water which claims to be healthier its not and non-GMO tofu embracing the anti-GMO pseudoscientific nonsense that many unthinking folk have bought into Overall decent but didnt captivate me to come back any time soon,Lotus Seed Vegan
Thomas C.,2020-02-28,5,New location even better food Highly recommend the sunny paté sub Especially if you like tuna sandwiches They have also been adding more daiya cheese lately which is just the cherry on top The food in combination with complimentary kangen water just makes this place 11/10,Lotus Seed Vegan
Teresa V.,2018-12-27,1,Came here because Ive always wanted to try their vegan Vietnamese coffee I was very disappointed in the taste of this drink Being Vietnamese and having drank a lot of their coffee this one was way too sweet Vietnamese coffee is know for its strong coffee flavour Secondly the almond condensed milk added a nutty flavour which I didnt like As well there was way too much ice which diluted the whole coffee flavour,Lotus Seed Vegan
Sara A.,2017-07-21,4,We had the following Lotus Seeds Pho  it is a slow boiled soup for over 6 hrs they use KANGEN water here with fresh broccoli zucchini carrots daikon and lotus root along with herbs  aromatic spices and non GMO tofu The soup was very tasty I will re-order next time Baked Spring Roll with mung bean vermicelli auricularia carrot  taro root It was very tasty but a bit too gingery for me Smoothies were delicious Great customer service too,Lotus Seed Vegan
Phi G.,2019-09-10,2,I stumbled upon this place during a walkabout Decided to give it a go without looking up reviews I will say that Im the 1% that does not like this place Thai Curry was too sweet for me I have become hypersensitive to sugars in food It ruined the dish and I couldnt continue Salad roll good but broke apart due to wet mushrooms Flavors were there if it could only stay together The food here seems like mediocre home cooking I supposed for vegans its food heaven but its slightly better than grocery deli section Overall disappointing that I had to go find something to fill me up afterwards Even now looking at the pictures makes me say yeah no not coming back ever,Lotus Seed Vegan
Jess S.,2018-09-23,3,Ive heard so many good things about this place and was super excited to check it out The place is small but offers so many awesome options for vegans and vegetarians plus GF If you have sensitivitys to garlic and ginger check this place too The staff are nice and very efficient I ordered the tofu satay which comes with salad a spring roll brown rice and two skewers of tofu veggies and pineapple The flavour is nice and the portion is big It wasnt what I was expecting and wished there was more sauce I also ordered the brown rice Alfredo It comes with mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes Definitely a unique take on Alfredo but again not what I was expecting Prices are good and portions are excellent I will definitely try this place again,Lotus Seed Vegan
Kate T.,2018-07-20,5,Came here for the 1st time and had the grilled satay platter on rice noodles  so delicious healthy and a huge portion Im so stuffed The satay sauce on the veg  tofu skewers was delicious,Lotus Seed Vegan
José Luis R.,2021-06-07,5,Crispy BBQ Burger Amazing you need to try Sweet Chili Cauliflower you need to try The Jalapeño Vodka Caesar very tasty as well you should try it,MeeT in Gastown
Sofie P.,2021-05-21,4,I got the first dose of the vaccine last week and decided to treat myself I was in the area anyway and only had to wait 20 or so minutes for a table for 1 take yourself out on a date Highly recommend I tried the Cauliflower starter for the first time and man oh man is it yummy To make it a meal I also got the TeeM Poutine which was as delicious as always Service was amazing  everyone was sitting outside for safety reasons obviously and it was getting late and a bit chilly and a few staff members brought out the heating lamps on request which was great My only complaint not really complaint but just like dang was the price of the cauliflower bites You get 5 wings so its not really evenly shareable if you WERE to split and its 11.5 I personally find this incredibly pricey for what you get Still massive bill aside this is definitely one of my fave restaurants and you will be sure to find something you like,MeeT in Gastown
Ruth H.,2021-11-12,1,We are visiting Canada I called the restaurant to make sure its possible to be seated Upon arrival we were asked to show a proof of vaccination which we had scanned in our iPhone and a photo ID which we also had scanned It was raining and we walked from our hotel with no ID The receptionist refused to let us in She just refused to let us in and the scanned IDs were not good enough for her We ate somewhere else with no issues whatsoever,MeeT in Gastown
Jill N.,2021-02-27,5,Agatha our server was awesome and went above and beyond Literally made our night Wow the chefs are also ON POINT  one of the best vegan cheesecakes I think Ive ever had Paired with coconut vanilla vegan ice cream Delicious For dinner I got the Seoul Bowl  my friend got the Caesar Salad with Kalamari mushroom calamari Both were fab ,MeeT in Gastown
Matt B.,2021-03-06,4,Only this location currently at least now offers brunch everyday from 11am-4pm so we had to try it out Pretty gigantic brunch menu with all sorts of creative items I ordered the Steak  Mushroom Benny 16.75 plus tax and my wife ordered the B.E.S.T Bacun English muffin Sausage  Tofu egg Breakfast Sandwich through DoorDash and our order was delivered in about half an hour  awesome Massive portions as Meet has become known for The Benny was an explosion of flavour from the steak soycurls sauteed mushrooms crispy onions and tofu egg with a really thick decadent hollandaise sauce You get two massive bennies so this alone would be enough to fill you up The dish also comes with salad and an emorious portion of home fries The salad is fine with a very pungent dressing you need less than half of what they give you and the home fries were battered and mega-deep fried  honestly I didnt like these fries  way too oily/greasy and heavy But the bennies themselves were delicious Same deal with the B.E.S.T  a pretty decadent sandwich with the bacun sausage and egg  which also comes with the same side salad and fries Overall this is really heavy greasy salty food Its a treat once in a while and the execution is very good on the main parts of the dishes Id rather some nice roasted breakfast potatoes or at least something less heavy/greasy Reasonably priced for the portion Glad that Meet exists and is doing such interesting stuff Recommended,MeeT in Gastown
Chloe C.,2021-01-23,5,Their new brunch is freaking amazing Great portions decent prices Lots of variety to choose from I wish I had enough stomach space to try everything Steak and Mushroom Benny 5/5 The soy curl steak and mushrooms were flavourful The hollandaise was creamy and delicious the tofu egg had a great texture and the mayo was so creamy and tasty The english muffin was good too The side salad was decent but could use more dressing The potatoes were nice and crispy but a bit too salty The buffalo sauce was creamy but a little too spicy for me BLT 5/5 The bread was fluffy the tofu scramble was great the bacon I think it might be Happy Veggie World had a good texture and flavour and the mayo tied everything together nicely Also comes with a side salad crispy potatoes and buffalo sauce Chikn and Waffles 5/5 Could use more chikn deep fried mushrooms but still delicious Waffles are super moist and tasty  you cant tell that theyre gluten free Im normally super skeptical of gf things but I was pleasantly surprised BBQ Baked Beans 5/5 Very delicious The bbq flavour was great and made these more unique than regular tomato baked beans Fried Egg 5/5 I believe this is the Happy Veggie World fried egg Was not disappointed as it was quite realistic and very delicious Would go to Vegan Supply to pick up some of these to make myself at home for sure Maple Mustard Mayo 4/5 I hated it at first but the more I ate it the more I liked it Definitely has a sharp tangy wasabi-like mustard kick to it Could be heavier on the maple flavour as it didnt really come through,MeeT in Gastown
Celine Z.,2021-11-07,5,It was our first night driving into Vancouver and we happened to walk by Not only was our server Emma so wonderful and welcoming the food was fantastic We ordered the Seoul Bowl and the Double Double burger Overall great energy and service definitely would recommend,MeeT in Gastown
Elvi R.,2020-08-04,5,Went twice in one weekend for their weekly feature Ive been to the Main St  the Yaletown location many times but I rarely come to the Gastown one The staff is super friendly I love how they expanded their patio outside Much more space now to enjoy your meal Al Fresco I had the Caesar salad with kalamarifor the first time ans it was really delicious it was topped with a vegan tzatziki Yum Their Mac  Cheeze is packed with so much flavour My little one really enjoyed it its pretty much the only thing that we order for him when we go to Meet I wish they had a kids menu or more kid friendly options,MeeT in Gastown
Manbir R.,2020-06-08,4,I was happy to have meet doors open after covid 19 shut down Good to be back here Its vegetarian peoples heaven All sort of colour ful dishes tingles your taste buds and fullfill your appetite Versatile drinks are my favourite thing here I had beet it which was a soda drink with beets n cranberry juice Kind a liked it Though u can sincerely drink just alcoholic drinks here,MeeT in Gastown
Mandarin Y.,2020-03-03,4,Ill admit I was a bit skeptical when coming here but I gotta say they exceeded my expectations I was expecting the food to be bland but everything we ordered was pretty tasty To start off our meal we ordered the artichoke spinach dip and sweet chili cauliflower The dip had a smooth creamy texture although I thought it could have used just a touch more salt The cauliflower was fried perfectly but I wasnt too fond of the sweet chili sauce As for my main I ordered the Lovely bowl and substituted the brown rice for quinoa The dish was surprisingly filling and very flavorful The dining area had a cool casual hipster vibe Service was very good and friendly I would recommend checking this place out if you are in the mood for something on the lighter side,MeeT in Gastown
Giselle M.,2020-01-14,5,It starts with a mission MeeTs mission is to help transition the mainstream to eating more plant-based foods in a friendly accepting and engaging venue from their website Not only that but they also aim to show people that comfort food that connects and nourishes us can be vegetarian/vegan delicious made from scratch and can actually be quite affordable Hands in the air for all those positive vibes My hubby and I both vegetarian/plant-based often vegan and work in the health  fitness industry first discovered MeeT late summer 2019 We were in town for a half marathon and after a long travel day we wanted/needed something nutritious fresh and delicious and to dine in a place with a fun and inviting atmosphere We pretty much hit the jackpot here at MeeT in Gastown Heres what we ordered and would recommend over and over again 1 The Big Yum 2 Organic Quinoa  Roasted Yam Salad 3 Hoochy Booch Turmeric Ginger Black Pepper Kombucha 4 House-made Ginger Shrub Beer Even if youre not necessarily vegetarian or vegan you should give this place a try I doubt youll be disappointed In fact you may just be converted  We loved the food bevy service and ambiance so much we came back again on our last night in town with a couple friends And we still talk about The Big Yum Bowl to this day,MeeT in Gastown
Bryan F.,2021-08-28,4,MeeT is definitely worth a visit They take traditional menu items and give them a complete vegan twist I definitely recommend their chicken and waffles The oyster mushrooms are delicious and the syrup compliments perfectly,MeeT in Gastown
Iris L.,2020-07-08,5,Of all the vegan desserts Ive tried from a variety of places the one Ill most come back to is the chocolate coconut ganache tart from here I ordered via Uber Eats as a late night treat and this did not disappoint It was packaged beautifully and when I opened the box the chocolate and mint combined created such a pleasant aroma The tart itself is absolutely delicious Everything about it tied perfectly together The chocolate ganache was just the right amount of sweet and when paired with the shredded coconut and vanilla creme drizzle it was like heaven for your mouth Even the crust offered a standout flavour of coconut with a soft texture that fit with the rest of the dessert well Each individual aspect had a delicious flavour and shined all on its own while combining together as a whole flawlessly If youre ever in the area I highly recommend checking out this treat If youre not make some time to Its worth it,MeeT in Gastown
Cyrah E.,2019-11-11,4,Much much better experience coming here the second time The service was good and the food even more delicious Todays order Notcho average nacho fries Butter chikkin poutine Crispy bbq burger Im glad I came back My bf and I had a great time,MeeT in Gastown
Paula F.,2019-08-16,5,Well worth the wait This plant-based restaurant is located in the heart of the Gastown in Vancouver There is a lot to do if you have to wait The indoor and outdoor seating was equivalent in size The decor is modern rustic and dimly lit in the evening The vibe during our visit was loud social and fun My daughter and I arrived at MeeT at around 6:30 pm on a Wednesday evening The restaurant was packed and we were told our wait was 20 minutes I was ready to pass but my daughter really wanted to dine here so we went for a little walk Within 10 minutes we received a text telling us our table was ready We were seated inside Two extensive menus were presented to us a drink menu and a food menu The food menu boasted several vegetarian creative comfort food items all made from scratch See my photos of the menu After much contemplation we opted for the Seoul Bowl and the Big Yum Bowl with a side of Butter Chicken The wait was reasonable for how busy it was Our bowls were colorful and plated well The taste was amazing The Seoul Bowl has more character than the Big Yum as it had many more spices and a zing to it Both were very filling The Butter Chicken was delicious and spiced like Indian Chicken Marsala It was a bit heavier than the bowls Service was outstanding Our server Ted S was professional friendly patient attentive and helpful The two single user gender neutral restrooms were basic industrial clean and functional So far this is my favorite restaurant in Vancouver 5 solid stars,MeeT in Gastown
Alannah M.,2020-12-29,3,My 4 broccoli  Hey prep team your scale broke Anyway the rest is F@$!ing off the hook but portion control is lacking Yum,MeeT in Gastown
Issabelle F.,2019-02-21,4,Im trying to slowly transition to a plant based diet and MeeT is one of my favourite places to get plant based food in the city Simply because it doesnt taste like your eating plant based dishes A couple things that Ive gotten from MeeT that Ive loved + Angry Burger I get this w the beyond meat veggie patty + Sweet Chili Cauliflower fave appy + Chiggin Things second fave appy + All their poutine their regular poutine takes the crown for me though + Hot Chiggn Caesar Salad so freaking delicious + Mac N Cheese Bowl Everything Ive tried Ive loved Even when I was eating meat I still loved coming here because everyhting is so delicious and filling For the prices youre paying the portions are very generous and the quality of the food is always consistent Since its in the heart of Gastown parking is really really annoying Luckily when I come to eat at MeeT Im usually taking transit If you are driving down theres a couple parking garages close by or theres street parking a few blocks away Service has always been prompt and friendly Plus they give really great recommendations This place is usually busy on the weekends and in evenings I love coming in post lunch rush though or right before the dinner rush If Im craving good comfort food MeeT is one of my first stops,MeeT in Gastown
Laura L.,2020-02-01,4,Went here last night Thought I would give the gastown location a try after having found the yaletown location somewhat disappointing The service was great and ambiance a lot more welcoming We tried the noodle bowl and beefless ginger bowl both were pretty tasty I wish there would have been more tofu in the noodles and more veggies overall in both bowls We also had the cauliflower appetizers that we had actually loved in Yaletown but this time found the texture more mushy and the sauce more watered down Overall the Meet restaurants are a decent vegeterian option but I have yet to be wowed Would recommend you give them a try nonetheless,MeeT in Gastown
Nidhi M.,2019-05-04,2,Came on a Friday afternoon and was seated at the bar right away We ordered the Ktown poutine  not good too strong of a kimchi flavor Not-cho average nacho fries  ok incredibly cheesy not my cup of tea The service was great but the food was not Parking street metered parking,MeeT in Gastown
Benjamin S.,2019-12-03,5,If youre vegan heres the restaurant of your dreams MeeT was my destination when MEETING up with an old friend from childhood who is vegan and Im more of a plant based person as well so this did me just fine Arriving in Gastown Ill certainly say that parking is no small task but once I found a place to park figured out how to use their easy parking system and headed over to the restaurant all the frustrating parts of the experience were over MeeT isnt right on the street front but in a cozy courtyard off the main drag Its perfect It made the experience all that much better as all the windows were open and werent listening to traffic whizzing by but just the sounds of our fellow dining companions The restaurant is large and when I visited on a summer day it was packed A very good sign of a good restaurant The menu is expansive and even hardcore meat eaters would be enthusiastic about the menu The days of thinking that vegans eat salads and boiled vegetables are over when you can get mac n cheese chicken wings to hamburgers and all the other comfort foods sans meat My friends boyfriend recommended a bowl that he gets there so I followed suit as everything in the bowl sounded delicious and right up my alley It was all very good and have thought about it since several times The next time Im in Vancouver Ill be heading to MeeT,MeeT in Gastown
Leon S.,2021-10-04,5,Amazing vegan pizza Employees treat you like family and the overall vibe of the place is real nice if youre looking for a cheat meal without cheating this is definitely the place for it,Vegan Cave Cafe
Chloe C.,2021-07-15,5,Really amazing pizza The cashier guy was really friendly as well Was skeptical of their gf crusts but the almond flour crust I got really exceeded my expectations I got half pesto and half bombay chikn and both were so flavourful Bombay chikn was way too spicy for me though unfortunately but it was still really tasty I loved both but the pesto with broccoli was my favourite I also got a twix bar which was good but not mind blowing,Vegan Cave Cafe
Sofie P.,2021-05-31,4,My go-to here Pretty delish Ive had this a number of times and always remember loving it This time it came with daiya cheddar on top of the house-made ricotta I cant remember if it always came this way The menu as well as other photos Ive seen of the pizza have mozzarella not cheddar Again still a good pizza but not as good as I remember pre-COVID,Vegan Cave Cafe
Sumit D.,2020-12-21,4,The short  dined in once in 2019 would go back again  tried 2 pizzas liked both  tried a dessert bar-shaped did not like it as it was too sweet and hard for me The long  vegan  no dedicated parking  one might feel a little uncomfortable about the location  some seating available inside  ambience was average,Vegan Cave Cafe
Elena A.,2020-04-19,5,What a great place to have vegan pizza I am amazed with all the flavors and the crust is just the yummiest Ive got their Freaky Greeky pizza Its a pesto based pizza topped with cashew feta garlic tomato olives and red onion The pizza is loaded with ingredients I enjoyed it so much I cant wait to order it again I highly recommend this place would choose their pizza any day without thinking twice Friendly staff and great service,Vegan Cave Cafe
Garry C.,2021-04-11,5,I just had the La Tinga burrito and it was fantastic It was huge I am totally stuffed Prices are reasonable for vegan food Oh and the brownies are quite tasty as well I recommend this to anyone vegan or not you will love it,Vegan Cave Cafe
Darius D.,2020-07-09,5,Im no vegan but that doesnt stop me from venturing out and enjoying the many vegan delicacies that exist Including pizza I was astonished how good pizza could be without meat It tasted amazing and felt super healthy using ingredients for the crust such as almond flour Usually I feel really bloated and unhealthy after eating regular pizza but I didnt have that feeling with Vegan Cave Cafes pizza,Vegan Cave Cafe
Karen N.,2021-02-23,5,The best vegan pizza Ive ever had The delito pizza was amazing and so were the staff Abraham and the other staff were so helpful kind and gave such great recommendations Also the desserts are so good Def try the New York cheesecake and chocolate Banana cake Really nice staff and very knowledgeable The mozzarella cheese was so good,Vegan Cave Cafe
Jennifer B.,2019-09-07,4,We read about this place and are so glad we made the trek over to Gastown to eat here Vancouver has a huge homeless population and this place is in the heart of it We walked and didnt drive but I dont think I would park my car in this area We arrived for a late lunch There were a few other people in the restaurant We ordered a pizza from the counter Everything is vegan and delicious Order came up with 25 minutes The crust was thin and crispy Really good stuff The four stars is for the location Food is five stars for sure,Vegan Cave Cafe
Sabina S.,2019-07-10,5,Whoa this place is amazing for vegans and non-vegans alike Its hard to find spots that do vegan pizza let alone do it well  Im continually wowed by the vegan options in Vancouver You can tell that the owner and folks who work here really put a ton of thought into the menu ingredients and recipes  it shows To start they offer three different varieties of crusts made fresh and in house Nutty Almond gluten free Casava gluten free too and organic wheat I love how they have figured out how to support all dietary restrictions  The menu is varied and interesting  sure to satisfy every palate and you can choose which crust you would like as well as build your own pizza entirely if you arent feeling the options We decided to go with the Bombay Badboy and the Buffalo Buddha On to the food The Buffalo Buddha was the star here holy moly The vegan blue cheese was seriously unreal  it tasted just like the real thing The wheat crust was the perfect thickness It also had chickpeas on it which I honestly would have never thought to put on pizza but it works so so well The chicken was made out of jackfruit and delicious They had definitely marinated it in buffalo sauce to make it super flavorful I havent had the best experience with jackfruit prior to this but they did it well Highly recommend ordering a side of their vegan ranch sauce to dip into because it worked really well with this pizza Also the vegan tapioca based mozzarella was equally unreal  I dont get how they achieve that melt The Bombay Badboy was also really good although we personally preferred the Buffalo Buddha more  The Chipotle Cilantro sauce they had on top was so tasty I loved the concept of an Indian-flavored pizza With this one we got a side of the Jalapeño Garlic sauce and I enjoyed the pairing but I also love spicy food  Overall the pizzas homemade crusts vegan cheese and vegan sauces were outstanding But to make things even better we ordered their cheesecake for dessert WHOA it was so good Im not a vegan and I honestly couldnt tell it didnt have dairy It was so fresh and fluffy We devoured the whole thing You gotta get it This place is the bomb Highly recommend going here whether you are vegan or not because the flavors and creativity will wow you  Oh and its a smaller establishment with casual seating  the perfect cozy environment Enjoy,Vegan Cave Cafe
Jess S.,2018-12-12,5,Thank you so much for creating another epic vegan pizza joint in the city Sister to the Caveman Cafe also excellent VCC offers homemade and delicious tasting pizzas Located in Gastwon/Tinstletown the place seats few but serves many The pizzas are homemade with 3 different crusts options 2 which are GF  casava or nut based I ordered half Pesto Prana sauted broccoli cashew ricotta on pesto sauce and half Freaky Greeky cashew feta garlic tomato olives red onion crushed walnuts on pesto and was pumped to see how big it was Add a side of ranch and this pizza blew my mind It was so delicious and very flavorful I almost cried Unlike Virtuos Pie which is equally good this place offers up more pizza like pizzas does that make sense Vegan meats dayia cheese as well as homemade and fresh ingredients I also added a cheese cake for dessert and it was by far the best dessert I have had in a long time The service was also impeccable They were fast and the efficient and the server was extremely sweet I 100% recommend this place Its going to be a huge hit  vegan or not,Vegan Cave Cafe
Shila B.,2020-06-30,5,I was recommended this place by a fellow foodie friend I am not Vegan and honestly vegan food is a little weird to me that is food that pretends to be meat but is vegan I dont hate it but I havent had really really good vegan food and the few that are are gems I had a pizza with cashew feta This was my first time having Cashew feta and it was actually pretty good The thin and crispy crust with the loaded vegan toppings actually tasted good I am honestly glad that they didnt use Diaya on my pizza cause that stuff is nasty to me that they used the nut based cheese It hasnt converted me into considering being vegan but places that can make decent vegan food gives me a different appreciation Prices are pricey but you do get what you pay for Super friendly staff,Vegan Cave Cafe
David A.,2020-09-16,1,I went to buy vegan desserts The selection of desserts had no PRICES item ingredients So I asked attendant He had no idea or told me there was no sugar then told me it was coconut sugar I asked him about another item he told me they were cheesecakes(but I thought it was vegan-when I questioned him he said cashew cheese))And then he proceeded to WIPE his nose with his hand Thoroughly disgusted I suggested to him that he was making it very difficult for me to buy anything form the vegan dessert section It seems to me the Vegan Cave is being run by a Middie Eastern oufit who are not conscious of basic business concepts of identification of items they are selling identifying whats in it or even basic hygiene practices Also NOT ONE STAFF MEMBER IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT WAS WEARING A MASK Nor were there any protocols in place that I could see,Vegan Cave Cafe
Neki T.,2019-10-27,2,The food bowl  pizza were great The service was pretty bad Grumpy people in the kitchen bored to death watching their cellphones all time Should be only for pick up as if you wanna go to the washroom you have to go through the kitchen Friendly advice if you wanna have arguments get out Its not nice watching you while we are eating,Vegan Cave Cafe
Samantha C.,2020-06-20,5,The taste and flavor of their pizza are to die for It didnt disappoint my picky stomach Ill definitely comeback soon Salad was good but i really enjoyed the pizzas,Vegan Cave Cafe
Gabriela F.,2019-07-22,5,This place is a GEM Amazing mouth Watering pizza great crusts both Whole-wheat and almond and the cheeses are beyond I imagined Say good bye to the days when the only vegan cheese available was daya Cave cheeses are top quality perfectly melting in the pizza Another great point is the size 15 for a 12 pizza is really good price My favorite so far is the pesto prana such a good combination Havent tried their bowls but they are very big for what Ive seen and are probably just as delicious as the pizzas,Vegan Cave Cafe
Heilige M.,2020-12-03,1,Well its vegan so expect some nasty food thats overpriced Just saying Or you could get real pizza,Vegan Cave Cafe
Ayaka H.,2019-02-23,5,After consistently perfect 5 star ratings do I really have to say more One of the biggest deterrents of going vegan is the misconception that one needs to give up pizza and cheese Vegan Cave Cafe is here to save your day and prove that a healthy and delicious vegan pizza can be made that tastes so close to the traditional pizza If you could eat two delicious pizzas but one was not made from the suffering of animals the veganized version would be your natural choice I was at the VCC 2 months ago with a friend and the warm and friendly customer service made a lasting impression Often times you can tell something is going to be real good by the pride of the staff members and that theory proved correct The pizza is to die for and the bonus is you wont feel yucky or bloated from them I will come back without a doubt the next time Im craving some real good pizza,Vegan Cave Cafe
Matt B.,2019-04-17,4,One of the best places in town for a vegan pizza that is somewhat of the artisan bent Small place with room for maybe 15 or 20 customers and also a good option for take-out Very creative pizza options available on either whole wheat crust or two different gluten free options for celiacs or those who buy into the gf fad Both pizzas we ordered were very tasty and left us very full 15 for a 12 is the only size which is pretty decent Friendly service and the pizzas came out in 10 minutes Definitely recommended,Vegan Cave Cafe
Mason J.,2019-05-24,5,When it comes to vegan pizza this place is the best My wife and I got the The Real Deal crust and the Buddha on the Beach and added chicken was so good,Vegan Cave Cafe
Chloe C.,2021-05-07,5,Feature items were all amazing Loved the chikn and waffles birria tacos and meatball sub Will go and try the fysh burger soon Cauliflower bowl was delicious too though the side slaw cucumber and rice felt unnecessary and I would have preferred just the cauliflower as an appetiser And of course you have to get the 3 staples kale caesar onion rings and yam fries,BeetBox
Jess S.,2021-10-26,4,Ok Ive come back several time as Ive been recommended it so many times Being vegan and straight in my hood I gave them another time x 10 I am a huge fan of their Crispy Cauliflower Bowl and I love it Its such a good mix of flavours and its huge I loved their meatball sandwich and their pizza sub These are part of their weekly specials and I cried when they got rid of the meatball one I also cried because they are not GF and it makes me sick but worth it Their chicken is packed with flavour and so crispy and flavourful Again not GF and I dont love the bread they use for their burgers but they do chicken the best in they city I am also a huge fan of their kale Caesar add bacon So delicious and filing Service is ALWAYS good They have exceptional staff and incredible prices I love that they sell their own house made products here as well,BeetBox
Matt B.,2021-05-16,4,Great vegan junk food for the odd occasion This place has been on my radar for some time but Id just never visited until now because its downtown and because I try not to eat junk food too often I had to try their esteemed chick-un sandwich specially the spicy Nashville Fried Chick-Un Sandwich 9.50 wjich was amply spicy and had a great texture  yum For sides we got the roast broccoli  mushroom XO sauce 6 which was oily but quite tasty and the yam wedges 6.50 which were tasty but covered with too much aioli for my tastes I wish the aioli came on the side Since we got our order to go I had hoped theyd include cutlery to eat the broccoli and napkins but we got neither so it was quite messy eating this in the park If you like vegan junk give them a try,BeetBox
Emily S.,2020-10-12,5,So over the moon with this thanksgiving sandwich I loved it so much we ordered 4 between us  Please please bring these back at Christmas or at least next year have them for the whole month of October I could eat this sandwich every single day its a great twist on their regular Seitan sandwich,BeetBox
Nami A.,2021-03-19,3,I really really wanted to like the food from here But unfortunately it was not as great as I thought it would be  Lets start with what could be improved so we can finish on a good note The fried chick-un sandwich looked like it had a good thick crust but its actually on the thinner side and the chicken on the inside is quite mushy Thats really as close as I can get to describing the texture It also does not have much flavour to it which was a bit disappointing The patty itself is thick but because there just isnt much flavour to it I ended up removing it and eating the sandwich without the patty It can also get a bit expensive paying 16 for fries and a sandwich I wouldnt have minded if I liked the food but it wasnt really palatable to me personally so that may be why the cost matters a bit more Ive also tried their Seitan Reuben Sandwich which I liked much better compared to their chicken sandwich However it does get quite greasy and if the sandwich gets cold you can really notice the grease But overall this sandwich is something I crave sometimes so although Im giving this establishment only 3 stars this sandwich is definitely something I would have again Now onto the good As mentioned above the Reuben sandwich is pretty good and I highly recommend trying it The bun they use for the chicken sandwich is soooooo good So good that I did not mind eating the sandwich sans patty Additionally they have an amazing selection of LOCAL kombucha that I also recommend trying Their yam wedges which Ive yet to try but have heard amazing reviews from my colleagues I think I will come back and give their warm bowls a try and update the review accordingly,BeetBox
Nicole B.,2021-04-17,2,I was craving some onion rings from here because they are bomb But I was dissatisfied with the beet salad  I have to keep it real The greens are from a regular grocery store and were OLD YUCK So disappointed,BeetBox
Kate M.,2021-02-02,5,UPDATE to 5 stars as Ive been back more than a couple times now to Beetbox and its so damn good I had to move my four stars to five My boyfriend is veggo and Im the meat eater so to find a joint we both agree upon in terms of junk food is really tricky to find but Beetbox has been our go to It seriously satisfies The chili cheese fries are honestly the MVP of the menu  the vegan cheese and chili is incredible The fries are perfectly crispy Takeaway they can get a little sogs but I dont even care the flavour is so good And theyve got an awesome spice to them I crave them often which is very dangerous The chick-un sandwich is my other go to on the menu as well as its a fabulous replacement for actual chicken Im a fried chicken obsessed person but if I wanna go less greasy plant based this is by far the best plant based sando or burger Ive ever had Cant recommend this place enough and if you are a meat eater check out Juke as well as its their other resto,BeetBox
Issabelle F.,2020-07-05,5,Yall Listen to me when I say Beetbox is LEGIT vegan comfort food at its finest Chefs Bryan and Justin knew exactly what they were doing when they crafted this entire menu because everything Ive tried has been delicious Most recently my brother and I ordered delivery from here We both ordered the Nashville Hot Chick-un sandwich both getting avocado inside and a set of onion rings to share I dont know if its because we were starving and exhausted but we both scarfed down our meals very quickly and in silence No crumb was left behind In the past Ive also had their bowls and cheeze fries which were filling and tasty as well The Nashville Hot Chick-un sandwich has been by far my favourite dish that Ive gotten from here though They use breaded and fried seitan as a meat replacement and personally if you blindly handed me this sandwich I would never know that I wasnt eating meat On top of that the flavour was impeccable the spice was perfect and the avocado was a really great touch Whether youre plant-based or a carnivore guaranteed youll love Beetbox As of right now they are still only offering takeout and delivery but their food is one that travels well so I encourage getting it delivered Thanks for consistently feeding me delicious vegan comfort food Beetbox SupportLocal,BeetBox
Nancy L.,2020-07-25,4,One of the best vegan fast food spots you can go to Fast food is in quotes because they serve fries burgers and etc but its not super quick serve which Im fine with Their seitan fried chicken sandwich is super tasty but the Nashville hot chicken sandwich is better Im a big fan of their chilli fries and their onion rings Their onion rings are battered in a spiced breading and it is so good I used to also always order a butternut squash salad but they seem to have taken it off the menu They accidentally gave me the Crispy Gordita once instead of the chilli fries and it was actually a really pleasant surprise Super tasty and very filling I actually ended up ordering it independently once after the accidental eating lol Most recently I ordered Kale Tahini Salad for takeaway It was really tasty crispy chickpeas = 10/10 with a tangy but creamy dressing However I was really underwhelmed by their portion size It was barely a third of the container full which was disappointing because I was hoping to have it as a main Despite that I am more than willing to continue being a regular at Beetbox,BeetBox
Ania D.,2020-11-20,3,We had the Fried Chick-un sandwich as well as the chilli cheese fries Also had some of the passion fruit kombucha Id like to preface this by saying that the staff were absolutely lovely So nice I wasnt a massive fan to be honest of the sandwich We had to ask from more sauce because I could barely taste the aioli which I was so excited about With the extra sauce it really bumped up the flavour but it didnt change the fact it was quite bready and the bites werent very consistent I dont know I just feel like it lacked flavour so maybe I shouldve ordered the spicy one As for the chili cheese fries Ive come to the realization that I personally dont think that I like chili cheese fries Something about a strong bell pepper taste is a little off-putting to me However if chili cheese fries are your thang I think you would probably enjoy these I also couldnt really tell that there was not meat in it I lowkey would give it 2 stars based on taste alone but when accounting for my personal food preferences as well as the amazing service it definitely gets bumped up which leads into a whole existential debate of yelp reviews what should you prioritize reviewing the taste the service the overall experience,BeetBox
Becky M.,2020-11-23,5,I finally ordered from here through Ubereats and Im glad I did Its been on my list for awhile it did not disappoint I ordered the Seitan burger which is called the Nashville Chick-Un Sandwich  It was as good as if not better than an actual crispy chicken burger Its a good portion filling and tasty I also ordered a jar of the Buddha sauce at 5 and a jar of spicy pickles at 7.50 both decent portions I look forward to ordering from here again and going to the restaurant when Covid 19 measures lift,BeetBox
Ruby B.,2020-10-26,3,Food was great for the most part Highly recommend the fries Big downside for eat in they dont require masks for food pick ups I lost my appetite after three unmasked people came into the small store and breathed less than 2 ft from the food I was eating Call me paranoid but it didnt feel comfortable Also the people who ordered pick up didnt need to sign in but those in the dining area did,BeetBox
Elizabeth K.,2020-08-10,5,This place is CRAZY good I got it delivered via doordash and it is incredible I got the nashville chickun sandwich the broccoli and the fries The fries were cooked to perfection The seitan chicken tasted like real chicken but better This is truly comfort food Highly recommend this place to anyone  not just vegans or plant based eaters It is seriously some of the best food ive had in Vancouver,BeetBox
Elvi R.,2020-07-21,4,Great option if youre in the West End and want to splurge Ive been here twice and both times wasnt impressed with their famous Fried Chick-Un Sandwich I found the patty to be way too mushy and it doesnt work with the bread cause it gets soggy and everything falls apart when youre eating it I have had way better vegan fried chicken elsewhere I do recommend other items on their menu instead like the Chili Cheeze Fries or their Crispy Gordita or even their Burger with Cheeze are probably my favourite items here Its a cute little place and great to grab takeout and eat it at the beach,BeetBox
Heather M.,2019-12-20,5,Try not to make the mistake I made by ordering everything on the menu dont under estimate how filling each of these delicious dishes are  a great alternative to Meet in Yaletown Got there around 6 oclock it wasnt busy at all but then suddenly the place filled up its not that big so if you have the option to go during an off time or get there before the rush comes then go for it they also have takeout if I had to choose between the gordita the chorizo hotdog or the chicken sandwich I think I would recommend the gordita but do come back and try the rest,BeetBox
Harmony C.,2021-04-07,3,I wanted to like this place so much Ive been there twice and had the same meal perhaps the other menu items are really great but Im not sure how likely I am to go back I ordered the fried unchicken sandwich both times everything about it is good until you get to the middle of it there is just too much seitan The middle of the fried chicken is a big lump of soggy seitan that I had to throw away a thinner patty would be PERFECT On top of that the fries were painfully salty both times I went,BeetBox
Iris L.,2020-07-19,5,I ordered from here via Door Dash I decided to try the Fried Chick-Un Sandwich with a side of French Fries The Fried Chick-Un Sandwich as written on their website is breaded and fried seitan miso aioli iceberg and spicy pickled cucumber Although seemingly simple the sandwich as a whole is packed with flavour and is quite filling too The combination of the crunchy seitan paired with the creamy aioli on the warm bun is a sensational mix complementing one another well As for the French Fries theres just something so standout about them that no other could compare to Theyre both perfectly crisped and well-seasoned and never seem to disappoint If youre looking for a meal that embodies the genre of comfort food for a hungry vegan youll find that here,BeetBox
Colin L.,2019-11-15,4,Always excited to try a new Vegan place out Ive eaten lunch at this restaurant a couple of times now and am overall impressed with the food service and staff I really like the feel of dining room its bright and open feeling with family style long tables There were also a ton of food delivery services picking up orders The onion rings here are over the top good thats right I was eating onion rings for lunch dont judge me and the crunchy batter is perfect It is the same batter used for the Chick Un Sandwich which wasnt 100% my texture preference but it certainly had delicious pickles ask for extra to accompany it I REALLY enjoyed Curry Cauliflower Salad the sprouted legumes are a nice touch as are the crispy chickpeas The only complaint is about the serving size which is a smaller than I would expect especially for a 12 item Next time Im totally trying out their Crispy Gordita,BeetBox
Sangeetha M.,2019-11-06,5,Wow this place blew my mind Im not a fan of fake meat but the seitan fried chickun sandwich was soooo good I prefer it over most real chicken burgers I tried two salads carrot Farro avocado salad and roasted squash salad which were great too I especially enjoyed the roasted squash salad I ordered from here through foodora so Im not sure if its the same prices but the only downside I would say is that it was expensive for what it is The chickun sandwich was 11.25 and small Salads were 14.50 each The portion of the salads were big though so Id say its well worth it,BeetBox
Olivia R.,2019-10-18,5,5 stars for both food and service plus the place is super trendy Kevin greeted us when we came in and definitely ensured we had a great experience He was so bright and cheerful too which helped as it was pouring rain today For food I ordered the gordida and my friend got the chickun butger we split onion rings as well The gordida was AMAZING The flavor was there just the spice I love My friend said her chickun burger tasted just like a real one The onion rings were super crunchy and the sauce was well balanced I am so happy we stumbled upon this chic and trendy spot on Instagram While I am not often in that end of downtown I will definitely come back and will be suggesting this place to all my vegan/vegetarian friends,BeetBox
Kevin O.,2021-10-04,5,Omg the food and service at the restaurant is amazing best Lebanese food in Vancouver,Nuba in Gastown
Jess S.,2021-10-17,2,Disappointed with the meals we ordered via delivery on a Friday at 7 pm I have been to this specific location on multiple occasions and have LOVED it But when ordering take out we were so disappointed with the poetion sizes which is not typical when dining in-house especially the tabouli salad I think between both meals we maybe got 2 tbs worth if salad looks big because its laying on too of the hummus and baba  but it was a sprinkle of salad  see picture We ordered the La Feast This Price is for 2 49.50 Two course vegetarian mezze sampler including hummus baba ghanooj olives pickles feta taboulleh Najibs Special falafel mjadra vegan stew  fattoush salad Served with hot sauce tahini sauce  tzatziki We also never got tzatziki and the tabouleh serving was a joke Fewer olives and just not what is typical We also ordered the Le Grande Feast This Price is for 2 Guests 69.90 Two course sampler including hummus baba ghanooj tabouleh olives pickles feta fattoush salad Najibs Special roasted potatoes lamb chops spiced prawns  chicken skewers Again not much taboulleh which I assume they ran out of and no tzatziki We also only got one dip each of the hot sauce and tahini Delivery is more expensive and less than what is expected at this price Delivery is not worth it in my opinion and is really disappointing Food is always delicious but disappointed with being snubbed on a few dishes We complained to the delivery app and no response,Nuba in Gastown
Rebecca C.,2021-09-04,3,I have several people recommending this place so I came with high expectations But I was very underwhelmed The best dish was red lentil soup but would recommend a little bit more lemon juice and salt with it The pickled red cabbage that came with a lot of the dishes was excellent accompaniment to elevate the flavors Our 1.5 yo loved it and had a whole bowl Tabouleh was dry Lamb hushwie was too gamey for our taste  may benefit from more onion sauteed with it Perhaps my days spent in Paris where many Lebanese restaurants had to compete for business made my standards a bit too high so take my advice was a grain of salt There was no coursing concept at this place Whatever you order it will come out within minutes Be prescriptive if you dont want all of your dishes come out at once,Nuba in Gastown
Sylvia Y.,2021-10-23,4,First time trying from the Nuba restaurants Went to the Gaston location as it was closer to work it is slightly tucked away as a below grade storefront for reference it is located right on the corner of the block across from Victory Square and Meat  Bread Id assume dine in wouldve been a great experience the ambience of the interior decor is very cozy Overall my takeout order was delicious I enjoyed the option to go half and half on the rice potato option The salad was well dressed very tasty overall Would definitely visit again,Nuba in Gastown
Dave S.,2021-09-01,5,Had the cauliflower Nabils Special based on the waitresss recommendations and it was great  not greasy big portions flavorful and healthy at the same time The Turkish coffee was also very enjoyable,Nuba in Gastown
David H.,2021-10-31,4,4 stars Great atmosphere Awesome food Lots of choice off the menu Tables a bit on the small side but adequate Large share platter consisted of lots of variety well presented of highest quality satisfying Meat portions were noticeably very underwhelming relative to pricing Servers provided diligent service were exceptionally busy and appeared stretched as the evening progressed Washrooms could use a refresh at busy times Overall a good experience As always for real You be the judge,Nuba in Gastown
Kristine E.,2021-09-04,5,Spectacular food One of the best babaganush duos Ive ever had We did the meat tasting menu and the only disappointing part was that we were leaving the next day and couldnt take our leftovers Super nice service great drinks We made reservations and very glad we did  it was packed,Nuba in Gastown
Claire M.,2020-12-30,5,visited summer 2019 This place is kinda hard/not obvious to find if youre not from Vancouver but oh is it worth the effort from what I remember you have to walk down stairs from the street sidewalk and it looks closed but its not or something   This was place was heavenly in every way Probably the best Mediterranean food I have ever had If youre in Vancouver eat here one night  dim lighting and small tables so would be an AWESOME date spot or just a fun catch up with a friend like I did ,Nuba in Gastown
Deez N.,2021-08-02,5,Ive walked by Nuba countless times when visiting Vancouver but never took the opportunity to dine Im so upset that it took me so long I visited Nuba with my wife and friends We ordered falafel lunch Najibs special lamb meatballs and and steak skewers We left satisfied and extremely happy with all the flavours and great services I was quite surprised by tasty jalapeño sauce which offered a nice kick,Nuba in Gastown
Jackie S.,2021-07-03,1,Ok I am SO confused Just placed an order by Uber eats and had the worst meal of my life  which even worse was a REMARKABLE rip-off 63 including a %15 tip It was basically not enough food for two  and nothing about it was even edible The halloumi was sweet and bland and I mean less than a quarter cup for 17 The crispy cauliflower and potatoes both were soggy and seemed boiled Just gross and disappointing This is the entire meal My small hand for scale I mean  the halloumi Edit to add  threw it in the bin What a waste,Nuba in Gastown
Eva D.,2021-10-21,2,Spider in our salad alive Told the waitress about it and she just offered us a new salad which we politely declined You would think the restaurant would care and have someone come over to talk to us as we were mortified but nothing no offeting us an appetizer in its place nothing they honestly dont care about service as you can see if other reviews Will not be coming back or advising friends or colleagues to visit,Nuba in Gastown
Laura L.,2020-08-08,3,Ate here for the first time after having read so many great reviews Unfortunately we were underwhelmed by the flavours We were excited by the many vegetarian options The halloumi dish was by far the star of our meal the sauce on top was absolutely delicious to balance out the saltiness of the cheese We also enjoyed the fatoush salad But otherwise the vegan stew falafels and lentil dish were quite bland And all the sauces were nothing to write home about Perhaps we are spoiled in Montreal with so many wonderful Lebanese restaurants but we will not be eating here again especially given the hefty price,Nuba in Gastown
Amy C.,2019-10-25,4,Came here for dinner and got the dip trio cauliflower and lamb entrée to share Pleasantly surprised with the dips especially the carrot A must try The cauliflower was delicious but as expected Lamb entrée was what actually let me down unfortunately I am usually a super big fan of lamb but the lamb I got was a little tough and one chunk was pure fat A few ups and downs but overall pretty decent restaurant and nice ambiance,Nuba in Gastown
Glen M.,2019-12-01,5,Okay uhhh-yummm How awesome was our lunch today Im sure this spot has been haunted for years I can picture it from 100 years ago with bar brawls every night Also it kinda looks like Jabbas lair And yes that adds to why I loved this place  and not to mench the food was amazing Sooo good We just ordered some dishes from the happy hour menu and everything was delicious Cauliflower trio of hummus lentil stew olives feta Was all there and all of it was super tasty The service was great too Hungry again,Nuba in Gastown
Dianna H.,2019-08-05,3,I seem to be in the minority here but I thought my experience here was just okay Good ambiance but not all the dishes were good Its definitely a great spot for vegetarians and vegans though as maybe half the menu is vegan/vegetarian friendly and marked clearly gluten free too My friend and I came for Saturday dinner around 6:45 and was seated within minutes We came at the right time since a lot of the patrons had just left or were about to leave for a concert nearby First thing you notice is the cozy set up Its dim and felt quite intimate Great for dates Id imagine We were super hungry and probably ordered a little more than we should have...if youre going the tapas route for reference 2 small plates per person should suffice but we ordered 5 and was really struggling to finish it near the end We tried marks my favorites Red lentil soup 6.50 for small favorite dish of the meal for both of us The lentils were cooked thoroughly and had the perfect amount of flavor Najibs special 12 we ordered this on the servers recommendation as its one of their most popular items Its essentially fried cauliflower served with a tahini dipping sauce I dont know how else to describe this other than that the cauliflower flavor really comes through so Id recommend this for cauliflower fans Chicken shish tawook 13 two skewers of chicken breast is served on top of hummus with avocado and pickled veggies on the side This was okay but nothing special The breast meat was okay for what it was but Im just not a huge fan of breast meat in general Garden falafel 11.50 the falafels are the reason we ate here My friend has been here before and absolutely loves them I tried one and thought they were pretty standard but Im also not big on falafels Lamb hushwie 13 was disappointed by this dish I thought it would be a hot dish but the minced lamb was slightly chilled As I reflect back on my meal over the course of writing this review I think part of why my experience here was lackluster is because the dishes were served in a very similar fashion Everything was served on top of hummus with some avocado or pickled veggies on the side so other than changing the protein there wasnt much variety I also didnt like the flatbread they gave us to eat with everything Im definitely not an expert but it tasted a bit overcooked and dry,Nuba in Gastown
Yuri Y.,2019-11-09,5,Pretty awesome Lebanese place Only been here once for dinner so far and they have good cocktail selection good food I had the 4 items in the photos The lamb was my favorite Fatty but done just right so it got crispy on the outside Pita was cold and below expectations Apart from that I liked this place and will definitely frequent Lunch is also great I had the Chicken Tawook plate and it was amazing We got there early but managed to get out in 40 mins which is pretty good,Nuba in Gastown
Ting A.,2019-10-19,2,This place is highly reviewed and Im disappointed that I didnt like this place as much as I had hoped Both the dishes in the menu and their pictures looked so good too Lunch plates are served with hummus salad pickled cabbage olives and choice of organic brown rice or roasted potatoes Pita on the side is included as well with tahini and hot sauce  Falafel Lunch Plate Victors secret recipe of organic chickpeas fava beans veggies and spices 16 To me the falafels were dry pickled cabbage was too strong in flavor roasted potatoes and salad were average and I dont care too much for olives So the pita and the hummus were the tastiest parts of the meal but even those were standard compared to other places  Nubas Chicken Tawook Lunch Plate grilled mount lehman chicken breast marinated in paprika thyme lemon and garlic confit 17 ,Nuba in Gastown
Jordan N.,2019-10-12,4,This is the third time Ive been to this nuba location but first trying the supper menu The place definitely has a different vibe at night with candles and a more crowded room The supper menu isnt too big but its enough The service was alright and we were served in a fair amount of time I ordered the Mama Dallouah 12 and Braised Brisket Stew 26 which was a decent appetizer into main dish combo The appetizer was a beet pommegranite garlic mix with garlic bread to dip It was pretty damn tasty but not presented very well The brisket was also tasty with the beef gravy seeping into the potato mash I wish the main course came with a couple more vegetables as I finished them much before I was done with the beef n potatoes There lunch menu is definitely more bang for your buck The vibe downstairs for supper is pretty darn nice but the menu left me a bit to be desired If Id come again Id try the feast combos which require a minimum of two to join in into Maybe then my ratings will boost back up Otherwise this experience was a decent 4,Nuba in Gastown
Richard U.,2019-10-05,3,3.5 star place Lebanese restaurant with lots of things you dont usually see on the menu Stuff tried Najibs special aka fried cauliflower I love a good fried cauliflower Comes with tahini and jalapeno mint dipping sauce Halloumi cheese served seared with tomatoes Chewy with good flavor Vegan stew this one is pumpkin or squash based with onions tomatoes and chick pea over brown rice Hearty and filling Comes with pita which you probably dont need Very vegetarian friendly with also an array of vegan options Food came out quite fast as well The gastown location is below street level and has an intimate feel It gets busy for dinner and recommend reservations,Nuba in Gastown
Nikita P.,2019-06-04,5,Love this place The ambiance is very cute cozy dim and candle lit The food is exceptional Enjoyed the Hummus Vegan Stew Crispy Cauliflower Lamb Kafta Baba Ghanooj Chicken Tawook with Hummus Red Lentil Soup but my most favorite was their Pistachio Cake dessert I came here for the first time when I was pregnant and had been craving their dessert for two years When I went back this time it was just as delicious as I had remembered it to be,Nuba in Gastown
Jackie M.,2021-11-14,5,Love Do Chay See my original review for more recommendations here but I wanted to add THE SAIGON SPAGHETTI IS FREAKIN AMAZING impossible meat a little spice nice chewy bouncy noodles i devoured this and could not stop talking about it to all my friends Also The Saigon Spaghetti broke my IMPOSSIBLE cherry What a great way to pop it Thank you Do Chay I order do chay in every week  Def my go to,Do Chay
Dana S.,2021-11-11,5,My introduced me to this place and I loved it They dont take reservations so when we arrived the hostess told us there would be a 15-30 minute wait and I wasnt keeping track of time but it was definitely within that window They just take your number and text you when a table is ready The hostess was friendly and throughout the meal I felt that our waitress was just attentive enough and was helpful with menu questions The decoration of the building is really nice without being over the top and felt warm and cozy on the cold rainy day it was outside I like that they still have dividers up where the tables are close together My friend and I ordered the Coconut Rice Cakes and Spring Rolls to share As a coconut fan the rice cakes were like heaven The middle has a creamy coconut filling and I liked the mild sweetness of the cakes Spring rolls had a nice crunch and flavourful filling and were good wrapped in greens and drizzled with sauce Lots of pickled carrots and radish in the sauce which was really good I felt like the sauce actually added something to the rolls and cakes as well as my noodles rather than just being an add-on that ends up covering the main flavours of the dish For my entree I had the Desert Island noodles These were not quite what I was expecting but I was very happy with them When I think of vegan meatballs I usually expect something along the lines of Beyond Meat but this wasnt like that at all with a more natural slightly nutty flavour and texture They used a generous drizzle of coconut milk to impart a coconut flavour to the dish and the tofu and peanut toppings added a nice crunch There was also plenty of greens so it felt like a balanced meal The portion sizes are large I took one of the rice cakes and about a third of my noodles home They finish the meal with a small complimentary coconut jelly which I wouldnt have ordered by itself even if it was larger since the flavour was too weak for my taste but it wasnt bad and as a complimentary add-on it was a nice way to close things out,Do Chay
Matt B.,2021-11-02,5,Update this place is still awesome Weve come here many times over the past couple years and the food is always high-quality Sometimes the service is a bit haphazard  forgetting certain items or with significant delays both for dine-in and take-out  but you always can forgive it for the food quality My only real complaint is it tends to be on the oily side  even compared to other Vietnamese and Asian restaurants They seem to update their menu regularly adding  removing certain dishes and modifying others This latest time we ordered way too much food but it was all excellent Bahn Xeo Crepe 18  Id seen people order this a few times and finally decided to try it Now it comes with plant-based prawns which are an interesting texture and totally un-fishy thankfully Other than that its mostly bean sprouts inside The crepe is somewhat crunchy and quite oily but very tasty 4.5/5 Black Garlic Eggplant 15  Perfectly cooked eggplant with a sweet garlicy sauce that works well over the rice You get a bit of steamed bok choy on the side Very good 4.5/5 XO Green Beans 13  Im a sucker for Asian green beans and these hit the spot Oily savoury and lightly sweet with a great garnish of garlic and fried onion served atop crispy vermicelli Really tasty 5/5 Lettuce Wrap 14  this is advertised as coming with tempeh but it only came with a few small pieces and instead came with a lot of fried tofu and diced veggies cooked into a swimming pool of oil Its tasty sure but this one seemed too different than advertised and is just too over-the-top oily 3.5/5 Mushroom Vermicelli 15  the best part of this dish are the little spring rolls and the garnish on top of the vermicelli If you dont mix this in with the noodles enough youll be left with very plain flavourless noodles underneath Very tasty dish though 4.5/5 Papaya Salad 13  done very well seasoned perfectly and comes with some nice bean curd skin sheet strips on top Really good 5/5 If you havent tried this place what are you waiting for,Do Chay
Andrew M.,2021-11-13,4,This was very good Totally a pan asian restaurant to go in vancouver And its vegetarian wow amazing But theyre all super good especially the aubergene whoops i meant eggplant hahhaha but they are all super good and super recommended from me I will be back soon again,Do Chay
John S.,2021-09-06,4,Interesting vegetarian take on Viennese food at Do Chay on Kingsways We started out with Spring Rolls 9 Banh Xeo Crepe 18 Spring Rolls seems on point The Coconut Rice Cakes seems a bit doughy but not sure if theyre suppose to be like that Then ordered entrees to share Vegan Prawn Curry 15 Saigon Spaghetti 15 Satay Noodles 15 The curry had nice flavor and interesting plant based prawns The spaghetti was a bit spicy and wasnt expected Satay Noodle and rich peanut flavor and the favorite out of the 3 A place I wont be interested in coming back again to try some other flavors,Do Chay
Christina L.,2021-09-30,2,Im sorry to say that this is the worst vegan meal I have ever eaten We ordered many items and nothing tasted good The vegan pho broth was completely bland the noodles were so mushy they broke apart immediately The broth was not hot enough to cook the sprouts The monsoon roll tasted like herbs but that was it The daikon cakes werent bad but really nothing special Ive definitely had much better papaya salad elsewhere Service was almost non existent as we ran out of water and no one came to refill,Do Chay
Karen F.,2021-05-31,5,My new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vancouver We have had take out once and dined in person this afternoon I would reorder every dish not missing meat for a second I am not a vegan or strict vegetarian but aim for mostly plant-based Of course in person dining the presentation is lot nicer and fried items were crispier but really most of it made the trip through DoorDash just fine after we reheated a bit in the oven Dishes we have shared include the Uncle Hings Wings Coco Rice Cakes Papaya Salad  so good had this twice  Jackfruit Lettuce Wrap  todays favorite Sweet and Spicy Bowl  definitely getting this again and Vegan Pho Portions are large We have had leftovers both times Service was very friendly modern covid friendly clean decor and there is a small patio out back if you prefer to eat outdoors,Do Chay
Stephanie T.,2021-05-25,4,Ive had this place bookmarked for awhile and finally got to try a couple of their dishes Everything was very tasty and satisfying Satay noodles I loved the spicy peanut broth It was so creamy and delicious There were a decent amount of toppings including roasted broccoli and cauliflower There were also 3 pieces of seitan which are these super tasty fried bits of gluten I probably felt like the portion for this was a little small as they were so good that I wanted more The noodles were a yellow colour which I didnt expect and came all stuck together at the bottom of the bowl However once I added in the soup they separated nicely and had a nice chewy texture Monsoon wraps the portion came with 3 rolls The pineapple sauce was very fresh and I could really taste the pineapple It went well with the wrap which had a nice crunch and lots of fresh herb filling I didnt really notice the tofu but they were still very tasty Surprisingly even after sharing the noodles and having 1 salad roll each my boyfriend and I felt full So these are definitely a good value and non-vegetarian eaters should not be worried I would definitely recommend trying this place out even if you arent vegetarian or vegan I really want to try the desert island noodles next,Do Chay
Maling S.,2021-09-07,5,Who knew Saigon vegetarian would taste so good Walking by or driving by Do Chay on Kingsway always have queues I made reservations and I can attest why they are so busy with walk ins The Coconut Rice Cakes was recommended by the server and first bite I was in flavour heaven with the sweetness from coconut and tampered with seared rice and herbs Spring Rolls are super crispy and delicious Wrap the spring roll with mustard green and herbs Every bite with a crunch with fresh vegetables and mint Saigon noodle had good flavour and packed with heat My favourite is the Satay Noodles drenched in peanut and sesame sauce Vegan Prawn Curry was also delicious with coconut curry with plant based prawns tofu and vegetables I need to come back to try more dishes from their extensive menu,Do Chay
Hanna K.,2021-02-06,5,Im typically not a huge fan of vegan/vegetarian restaurants because 1 the food tends to be flavourless 2 overpriced 3 small portions However Do Chay has consistently blown me away with their FLAVOURFUL dishes Everything was so tasty Their coconut rice cakes are a MUST Their rice bowls curry noodles jackfruit lettuce wraps salad rolls spring rolls everything was literally perfection Their dishes are unique  leaves you feeling full from all the vegetables Thanks Do Chay Yall are killin it,Do Chay
Ceci L.,2021-01-17,4,Im not a vegetarian but enjoyed the food here Prices are reasonable and portions are big and good for sharing Started off with the spring rolls It was light and crispy and not overly oily I really liked the banh xeo crepe It was huge and came with tons of greens They have two noodles  soup items on their menu vegan pho and bun bo hue The vegan pho was pretty much vegetable noodle soup and lacked flavour Ill stick to meat-based pho broths I enjoyed the bun bo hue it was a lot more flavourful However I came back a 2nd time and the bun bo hue broth seemed watered down My least favourite dish was the salted egg yolk eggplant It sounded unique and I love salted egg yolk but this just doesnt mix well with eggplant,Do Chay
Shannon K.,2021-03-01,5,I tried this cute little place since my friend is vegan I am not and it was really good We ordered Uncle Hings wings  fried mushrooms must order The seasoning was SO flavourful Grilled eggplant  came with rice and veggies also I would def order again Coco rice cakes  these were good but I didnt love the coconut hint They are a restaurant favourite though Jackfruit lettuce wraps  also very good This was one of my friends faves Monsoon wraps  dry chewy not very tasty haha I would highly recommend especially if you are vegetarian even if youre not but you cant really beat using meat products in Vietnamese food so I prob wont go back out of my way unless Im catering to my friends diet,Do Chay
Mrs H.,2021-06-07,5,Im really impressed with this place  The are definitely on point  Ive been back so many times for take out and dine in Ive almost tried every dish here and they all have been super delish I dont even know where to start Uncle hings wings are so good Oyster mushrooms are sooo good  Nice and a great kick The bun bo hue is the only one that I feel should maybe not have so much Lemongrass in there Its cut up into little bits and you will get a mouthful which isnt the easiest to eat so maybe if they smashed it in the broth  The spicy sesame bowl isnt spicy at all  But the other dishes have a good enough of spice in them  Other than that  right now this would be my go to vegan restaurant You wont be disappointed,Do Chay
Sayoka H.,2021-01-20,4,My third visit to Do Chay This is an updated review from my 1st visit there were lots of communication problem with walk-in seating and was given the wrong quote time but through my friends strong recommendation I decided to give it another shot From the three visits I would say the pot stickers are delicious The sauce is delicious and the filling is sweet and tangy I really enjoyed the presentation The dessert noodles had a very coconut-ty sweet taste and the portion size is shareable My friend ordered the Mushroom Vermicelli and it tastes better with the Fish Sauce on the noodles Overall service was great food took a little long to hit the table due to numerous uber eats orders I do recommend this vegetarian restaurant to meat-lovers wanting to try vegetarian food I love the Asian fusion mix and enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant,Do Chay
Clara Y.,2020-11-14,4,Ive been meaning to come here but covid and limited seating makes it so hard I opted for delivery the first time and ordered the satay noodles vegan bun bo hue black garlic eggplant kabocha curry bowl Satay Noodles Yummy This was definently one of the best things I ordered The broth was rich flavorful and yummy My dad loved it and hes hard to please Vegan pho I wasnt a fan of the smell of the broth but ordered this for my mom Its not bad but I definetly had better Bun bo hue Yum this was good definently better than Chau veggies bun bo hue A must order for any bun bo hue lovers Kombocha curry bowl I wish I had this for dine in There wasnt much sauce and I really hate it when restaurants do that I think itd be best if they were to separate the curry sauce from the rice so the rice doesnt soak up all the sauce But this was good I just wish I ordered it in person to see how its like Black garlic eggplant Ordered this due to the reviews but maybe I got in for takeout so it wasnt the same Not sure why this was a hit but this was the most underwhelming one we ordered Theres no flavor and again if there was sauce the sauce has been soaked up by the rice Ended up having to put fish sauce and chili oil to make it better I enjoyed all the food and wil definitely go in and check them out,Do Chay
Kristie W.,2020-09-27,5,Completely exceeded my hopes and expectations Its my first time here and my favourites are the XO potstickers and satay noodles The potstickers are the tastiest potstickers Ive ever had meat and veggie potstickers included The potsticker skins filling and sauce together made me a bit upset that there are only 5 pieces in one order The satay noodles are so loaded with flavours that you cant pin point each individual one but you taste the rainbow with each mouthful Love that its loaded with veggies Also like that it introduced me to seitan which essentially tastes like whatever it gets soaked in The salted egg eggplant is also so interesting and yummy The first few bites made me wish it had a sweet and spicy sauce to go with it but I grew to be very fond of it Now if only Do Chay had a dessert menu hoping for their take on deep fried banana with ice cream,Do Chay
JenJen C.,2021-08-24,4,I love this place Everything taste so good Im not sure if they ave much vegetables options but I mostly order their famous dish and it was mostly deep fried a bit too heavy at the end of the meal Services are really nice Its a place I would definitely go back,Do Chay
Loewe C.,2020-08-31,4,Came here as a non-vegetarian and non-vegan and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food Prices were reasonable and portions were big The food is good  very savoury and does not make you feel like you are missing out by not having any meat We ordered the salted egg yolk eggplant crepe and the satay noodles Crepe was very interesting and big  good to share with 2 people The satay noodles had a very creamy peanut broth and was very hearty The salted egg yolk eggplant sounded very trendy but it tasted more like normal fried eggplant very subtle salted egg yolk flavour All in all I will come again if I ever feel like being healthy and eating more vegetables Full review https://sincerelyloewe.com/do-chay,Do Chay
Michaela B.,2021-06-23,3,To start with the positive the coconut rice cakes were so delicious and unexpected Ive never had anything like them and I would definitely order again The banh xeo was ok It tasted good especially paired with the fresh herbs and dipping sauce But there was a too much jicama and the crepe wasnt quite crispy enough making the dish a bit soft and soggy The bun bo hue was a disappointment The broth was very bland and the tiny pieces of lemongrass made it a pretty unpleasant eating experience It feels like it was made by someone who has never cooked with lemongrass before The vegan bun bo hue at Khoe is wayy better Overall Id give Do Chay another chance Id like to try the banh xeo in house rather than delivery to have it fresh And those coconut rice cakes are worth returning for,Do Chay
Sara L.,2021-09-04,5,This is a gem of a restaurant Third time going and excellent as before Tried the coconut rice cakes for thé first time and they were delicious and I like anything Ive ever had before My main dish was eggplant and it was so tender and tasty with a lovely sauce Portions are large here the service is great and friendly I look forward to returning,Do Chay
Tyson L.,2021-06-26,5,Rarely will you find MeeT empty  an arbitrary indicator of popularity if you care about that  as the vegan food is of high quality with solid portions After multiple visits some with Vegans others with the oh but you need animal protein to survive cohort 90% of guests would recommend the restaurant for its all-inclusive varying menu My test for a good restaurant is whether I could replicate the dishes and/or be willing to create the dishes and I could not with the same flavors Personally a big fan of the Macro bowl or the Meet burger but most friends are content with the selection of poutines and the Mighty Mac Good quality food is good quality food and whether youre vegan or not you will be satisfied,MeeT on Main
Melissa E.,2021-10-09,4,Im not a vegan but I love trying innovative vegan food This place has a great drink menu and a great vibe Ordered the fried oyster mushroom calamari to start and it was super tasty Perfectly fried served with a nice garlicky tzatziki and a wedge of lemon Honestly I actually prefer this over real calamari My only complaint was it was a tad salty For the mains we had The Crispy BBQ burger and the Meet Burger This comes with salad and fries and both are delicious Salad was lightly dressed and had a nice tangy dressing Fries were soooo good like too good like you eat too many you have to unbutton the top of your pants after so you can breathe good The burgers were tasty but very big and hard to eat Bbq sauce was delicious Definitely coming back to try the bowls next Service was great as well,MeeT on Main
Matt B.,2021-07-30,4,Im much more sold on this place nowadays I order every few months and am always satisfied One of my favourites is the Seoul bowl 17.50 plus tax which comes with deliciously seasoned and sauced chicken perfectly fermented kimchi sauteed mushrooms and onions cooked kale cooked bean sprouts raw carrots some nori served over brown rice and drizzled with a nice sweet ginger soy sauce Generous portion and nicely constructed bowl Very satisfying dish One of the better non-ethnic vegan places in town Recommended,MeeT on Main
Jill N.,2021-03-18,5,Went here for St Patties Day Our server Derek was AWESOME Seriously made our night I got the double double and my friend got the angry bird with poutine It was my friends first time having vegan food and explained wow I thought Id have to compromise flavour but this is some of the best food Ive ever had a restaurant ever For dessert we had chocolate moose  so light and fluffy  and the cheesecake which was also very tasty and a bit richer Was an amazing evening Will definitely be back Huge shout out to Derek again for all his guidance patience and for being an awesome person as well Definitely put our already great evening off the charts,MeeT on Main
Maling S.,2020-09-17,5,Sept 17 and went with my brother for vegan food Decided ok MeeT on Main We went about 5:30pm and was able to get a seat outside I now need to watch my sugar intake closely Its harder to eat out because of this They were able to find something I can have and adjusted some ingredients I had the Macro bowl Instead of mushrooms which I am not a fan of with sweet potato It was delicious I can confirm the dinner did not spike my blood sugar the next morning My brother had the Main burger and he enjoyed it He said its the best veggie burger he has had They were bumping busy with lots of people picking up orders Highly recommend,MeeT on Main
Dana S.,2021-02-18,5,Ive ordered takeout from the Yaletown location but this was my first time dining in at a MeeT and I was pretty impressed The menu has great variety  no matter what type of cuisine you might be craving theres something for you Apparently theyre most known for their burgers but I really enjoyed the bowl I had here and from their Yaletown location I had the Butter Chikkin and absolutely loved the chicken the texture was very satisfying and it delivered the savoury flavour of chicken without being too meaty The curry sauce was also complex in taste and just spicy enough They serve it with a side salsa salad which I thought was kind of a surprising pairing with the butter chicken but it was really good regardless Everyone in my party really enjoyed their food and portion sizes were good all around This is the first restaurant Ive visited that does temperature checks for customers and from how simple it was Im surprised more places arent doing it The staff were all very friendly and despite being busy they were efficient and just attentive enough,MeeT on Main
Michelle H.,2020-05-08,4,I havent had this is YEARS I used to be SO obsessed with Meet on Main back in high school During lunch breaks spare blocks and even before basketball practices/games I would always be rushing to Main Street to pick up my Noodley-Thai order Now that Im a little older and my preferences have changed a little i cant wait to finally try something else on their menu as Ive only ever ordered Noodley-Thai I also absolutely love their Chocolate and Coconut Ganache Tart vegan dairy-free it just melts in your mouth This is definitely up their in my top 5 favourite desserts  A little bit on the pricier side but its always a great experience whether Im dining in or getting take out My only complaint is that the food does take quite a bit of time,MeeT on Main
Aaron W.,2021-05-24,1,Saw 3 patio tables empty and barely any line ups but was told to wait 45 mins Thought gave this a try again but the service isnt there Was also promised a gift card from the owner but its been over 3 years and never got that gift card Not gonna support this restaurant again,MeeT on Main
Jasmine Y.,2021-09-15,5,Ordered takeout online to the Main Street location I arrived a little early and my order was done right when I got there which was awesome Love ordering online and picking up Makes it so convenient I ordered the ginger beef bowl and it was awesome Ive ordered a few times and everything Ive gotten has been amazing My sister is vegetarian and this is the 1 place she asks for Definitely one of the regular go tos,MeeT on Main
Jennifer B.,2020-03-12,5,Love the MeeT restaurants in Vancouver Ive eaten here several times over the past few years Street parking is easy at this location Its usually busy but the wait if any is minimal We went on a Wednesday night for dinner It was packed but we got right in The entire menu is vegan and delicious We ordered two things wed never had before hot and sour soup and a special poutine The soup was very bland and brothy I wouldnt liken it to hot and sour soup at all The poutine was excellent and is featured just this week They have several types of poutine offered on the regular menu though The burger is fantastic if you want comfort food Comes with fries and a little salad The mushroom calamari is a must Lightly battered and delicious,MeeT on Main
Purple Z.,2021-08-10,5,Ive been a couple times to the restaurant in Gastown always liked it Not disappointed at the Main location,MeeT on Main
Chloe C.,2020-09-11,5,I probably wont be dining out as often since school has started but I went to MeeT today for their weekly feature and it was hella good Chikkin Whoa-Fredo 5/5 I absolutely adored this dish While I would have liked a little more sauce since the sauce was delicious I have zero complaints about this The noodle to chikkin ratio was pretty good the Alfredo was creamy and flavourful the chikkin was tender and the arugla was fresh Alfredo is usually a hit or miss for me but MeeT nails it every time Crispy Kalamari Caesar 4.5/5 This was really good but for the first time in my life I am saying that there was too much dressing While I appreciate the generosity Ill probably ask for the dressing on the side next time The mushrooms were nice and crispy and the tzatziki was creamy and flavourful The greens were fresh and the croutons were crispy I really enjoyed this Theres a reason why MeeT is one of my go-to restaurants Their food is amazing and their weekly specials are always something to look forward to I will definitely be back hopefully soon,MeeT on Main
John R.,2021-02-02,3,I used love MeeT on Main I order MeeT via door dash every Saturday I am noticing the quality of the food is going downhill from the Main Street location My friend and I ordered the Crispy BBQ Burger Hands down this is a very delicious burger mouth watering and you cant tell it is vegan The burger this time came so spicy that it caused heart burn and I had to stop eating it My friend also commented and asked me why so spicy The box the burger came in had bbq crispy burger written on it The previous burgers I have had were never this spicy Oyster mushroom Kalamari is great appie to order We highly recommend this dish This passed weekend I ordered MeeT on Main and the burger bun was stale and the flavour was not like I have had before,MeeT on Main
Norman S.,2020-02-25,4,Never thought vegetarian food could taste this good Im a meat lover like all things meat Im there I was skeptical when we decided to go here but kept an open mind When I think of vegetarian or healthy foods I dont normally associate it with something flavourful or something I would opt for We ordered the Seoul Bowl and the Butter Chikkin Poutine Butter Chikken Poutine was hella good Like WOW didnt realize there could be something so flavourful and so tasty and it doesnt even contain meat This was absolutely tasty any way you look at it Seoul Bowl was jam packed with ingredients and had a variety of textures from kimchi to bean sprouts to carrots and mushrooms Seriously enjoyed every bite of it There was a slight confusion as I wasnt aware I would be ordering food from the bartender but once we figured that out everything was smooth The staff there was amazing and the bartender was super nice and made some killer drinks Ordered a That dont Empress me much and a Meet Ceasar The Empress drink had a nice frothy layer on top and the orange and grapefruit flavours made it extra tasty Ceasar was Ok to me but I feel that way about most Ceasars as its a pretty standard drink Also if youre a fan on Kombucha they have it on tap and the entire dining experience I watch them pump out dozens of drinks out Must be sometime to check out next time I think you deserve to experience this place You maybe skeptical like me but go in there with an open mind I think youd be really surprised,MeeT on Main
Elsa C.,2020-01-31,3,It was a rainy Friday in January A group of 8 of us arrived at 11:30 and were seated immediately There was a list of kombucha but only 2 were available at that time I ordered the house Kombucha and it tasted alright We ordered at 11:52am and the order arrived at 12:07pm I ordered the Thai salad I forgot to ask for the dressing to be on the side and I find the salad to be a bit overdressed for my liking The salad was ok Nothing special Some of the group didnt really like it some find it good Overall nice experience,MeeT on Main
Chef D.,2020-09-24,4,This spot always serves up the yummiest vegan food My personal favourite is the Vegan Mac and Cheese If you ever need somewhere for some delicious vegan comfort food,MeeT on Main
Patrick F.,2021-01-27,5,A great selection of Vegan food The sweet chili Cauliflower was delicious The burger was great Looking forward to visiting again,MeeT on Main
Niall O.,2021-09-29,3,The staff all seemed really nice and their was a nice atmosphere but the food was pretty poor It could just be that my partner and I both ordered the wrong item or were there on an off night but we felt like they were trading much more if the novelty of the vegan food resembling other dishes than it actually being particularly tasty,MeeT on Main
Autumn M.,2021-04-08,5,Its taken me way too long to review this place Ive eaten in-house twice over the past year and ordered takeout from here countless times I usually get the macaroni and cheese with the added sausage and damn its so good That said Ive ordered quite a few things off their menu and Ive been impressed with everything They dont skimp out on flavour When we ate in the service was great too The waitress was friendly and not intrusive When its safe to do so well definitely be back In the meantime well happily keep ordering takeout,MeeT on Main
Annette Y.,2019-06-05,4,I love going to MeeT with friends Its the perfect places that satisfies everyones palate and leaves you feeling like a true Vancouverite also stuffed for eating plant based Plus the atmosphere is so much fun We had no issues getting a table for 5 on a Saturday afternoon and the service was really fast too Just wish they came around more often to refill our waters So far Ive only stuck with the bowl dishes at MeeT which Ive found so filling and hits the spot every time There are plenty of veggies in each bowl and it comes with brown rice too The noodly Thai has a great sauce but doesnt leave you feeling greasy after which I love Ill have to come back to try the poutine and the burgers another time,MeeT on Main
Cherry L.,2021-10-29,3,I am a long time customer of CHAU and enjoy their food and drinks Their items are usually always great however I am very disappointed with their execution this time Included is a photo of the coconut shake which I requested for it to be no ice because it was a very cold night This is unacceptable behaviour from a restaurant I know of no other place that under-fills their drinks like this due to a no ice request If this is the case I think they should list the amount of ml on their menu to let the customers know the exact amount they are purchasing Or at least inform the customer at point-of-purchase I am actually already very surprised that I found one piece of coconut meat in this takeout drink because Ive received this drink multiple times without a single piece of coconut meat when I get it to go they usually put two pieces when you order for dine in For a drink that is charged at 6.25 plus taxes I am very disappointed in the amount that was given It is barely half full Overall the taste of food and drinks is great but I am very disappointed in the restaurants execution and inconsistency,CHAU Veggie Express
Marc L.,2021-10-22,5,just a lovely place to be and the food is very carefully prepared clean nice patio fun staff,CHAU Veggie Express
Thu N.,2021-10-29,4,The menu is diverse with different types of vegetarian dishes compared to other vegetarian restaurants The food is mixture of Vietnamese  Western styles and tastes so good The space is a little small and more suitable for small group gathering  under 5 people,CHAU Veggie Express
Van F.,2021-10-07,5,Today I witnessed a couple of losers harassing the Victoria Street staff for upholding mask/passport policy So unfair You guys are doing a great job keeping yourselves and community safe by following provincially mandated health orders My lunch was delicious,CHAU Veggie Express
Domenic P.,2020-08-29,5,The golden temple soup has healing powers I truly believe it is the best soup Ive had It is named after the famed abode of god a chromed out holy architecture that looks like a wet dream of Salvador Dali who was once quoted saying I dont do drugs I am drugs Which is what this soup is drugs You crave it and it makes you feel better The song Love Is Only A Feeling came on through the speakers after It was placed on my table On this particular day I didnt have plans of coming here but the guy in front of me was turning left and it took me until right now to realize that was no ordinary man that was my spirit guide Woscar that lead me to this soup Please consider offering bibs as my white shirt now has many turmeric stains,CHAU Veggie Express
Marina B.,2020-09-28,5,I absolutely love Chau I cant believe that for years I held off trying it because I was under the false belief that I wouldnt feel fully satisfied with it being vegan I finally tried it one evening with a vegan friend and boy was I wrong The moment the golden temple broth touched my lips I was hooked Ive been coming here regularly ever since Even my meat-loving boyfriend loves it Im so obsessed with the golden-temple soup that I cant not order it every single time My favourite way to have it is with the quinoa which sounds like its going to be too healthy tasting but it just compliments the soup so well The texture of the quinoa is so nice in the soup and it doesnt really absorb the broth too much I also like to get extra veggies between my boyfriend and I we get one order of extra regular veggies broccoli cauliflower carrot and one extra order of yams The extra veggies makes it all the more hearty and I always have leftovers Even though I always get the golden temple Ive tried lots of other things too Everything so far has been delicious Ive tried the diving for pearls soup  which is really tasty the fresh rolls the tempeh one is my absolute favourite the baisou chips must get the coconut shake so yummy must try and the peanut bar you absolutely must get this The ice cream is also really yummy my favourite is the green goodness I dont usually like vegan ice cream but this is so delish Chau is a great place for a quick casual healthy bite for vegans and non-vegans a like The service is always friendly and prompt and the food is always delicious and consistent It also a great place for takeout which is especially important in these times I find in a lot of other restaurants the food either doesnt take out well or you end up getting screwed on the portion size or preparation So Its really nice to find a restaurant where you know you are going to be equally satisfied when choosing takeout and never have to worry about feeling ripped off Im sure Ill be back again next week for my favourite golden temple soup,CHAU Veggie Express
Jay K.,2021-09-30,1,they let me come in wait in line for 10 min then once i started ordering takeout told me i cannot order without a vaccine passport i did show my vaccination card and was wearing a mask they couldnt accept my order by phone either because it wasnt working ive been a loyal customer ordering at least weekly for the last two years and im not going back,CHAU Veggie Express
Sydney K.,2021-09-04,5,Just moved to Vancouver and was recommended this place to eat by a friend and it did not disappoint Im vegan myself however I was with my omnivore parents and they were also blown away by how amazing the food was Came here twice and tried different dishes and all of them were astounding Will definitely be my go to place for a meal out,CHAU Veggie Express
Patricia F.,2020-09-01,5,I love this place You wont miss meat here My boyfriend is a self professed meat eater and he regularly suggests grabbing dinner from here which is a huge statement Theyve recently knocked down the wall that seperates the spaces and makes the place feel bigger For Covid measures they have stickers on the ground for you to wait to order Plastic barriers have been set up on tables as well For the food I have never had anything not 100% delicious here My favourite is the Golden Temple Bowl which is creamy from coconut milk and packed with flavour The rickety Rick shaw noodle bowl is also very delicious The tarp chips come with an interesting dip At first you may think its a peanut dressing of sorts but once you taste it its very different Definitely recommend this place on any day,CHAU Veggie Express
Glen M.,2020-01-20,5,OMGawda I left this place full as a tick First off its a very popular restaurant along Victoria st 10 minutes after we sat down it was packed Every table filled including counter space so get there early or prepare to wait IF you do have to wait the wait is worth it Cute place All veggie Cant go wrong Well the food  to start we had two different kinds of delicious spring rolls which were very good and these amazing tarot I think thats what they were chips with a dip that was awesome So good And my main meal was the very good Golden Temple something soup that was in a delicious coconut broth with tons of veggies incl a couple veggies Ive never tried before all in a massive bowl Just know youll get fed well and itll be delicious You should try this place,CHAU Veggie Express
Ly W.,2019-12-22,2,Ive tried coming to this restaurant twice and both times it was packed I finally got to try this restaurant today and was excited to see what the hype was about Honestly it wasnt really anything special or spectacular You order at the front and find a seat and food is served to you The servers were great The ladies were so friendly and came by to collect our dishes even though its half self served and asked if everything was okay We didnt find the gentleman at the cashier the owner very friendly No smile or friendly conversation or thank yous when we went up to order Prices are around 11-14 and portion is decent BUT I wasnt full when we left I ordered the Rickety Rickshaw and it is like a normal Vietnamese vermicelli bowl but without meat It had carrots cucumber radish bean sprouts bean curd and four spring roll bites While the ingredients were fresh I found the dish very ordinary The spring rolls were hard like slightly stale and I found the proportion was a little off I was done the spring rolls and was left with a lot of noodles and veggies My bf ordered the Tropical Rainstorm and the coconut was overwhelming If you like coconut then you would like this dish My bf didnt like it because it was on the sweet side and tasted kind of like dessert We also tried the thai milk tea and coconut pandan icecreams We liked how the icecreams werent very sweet but the flavour was light The coconut pandan icecream was quite delightful but I couldnt taste the Thai milk tea flavour for the Thai milk tea icecream Would we come back Probably not If we were craving vegan or vegetarian dishes we prefer the MeeT restaurants because their dishes are flavour bombs,CHAU Veggie Express
Elvi R.,2020-08-16,4,Ive been here multiple times and have ordered pretty much the same thing every time We love the Namaste Fresh Rolls  Nonla Crispy Rolls We order these to start every single time we go For the main I really enjoy the Midnight Swim Bowl with thick rice noodles Its super flavourful ans a little spicy Very delicious We also enjoy the Golden Temple Soup when its a rainy day The Baisao Beach Chips with the tofu dip is great to grab and have as a snack later on,CHAU Veggie Express
Masaki F.,2021-10-03,2,It was pretty good before but now all potions got smaller and the taste didnt same at all of course the price was higher disappointed but I guess time goes by,CHAU Veggie Express
Sayoka H.,2020-10-08,4,Been a big supporter of CHAU Veggie since their open Never once have I had a terrible experience and the food is delicious My got to is their golden temple soup with a side bowl of rice My goodness bowl of hot soup on a crispy cold Vancouver day is heaven in my mouth Portions are on the bigger side but hey you get your moneys worth Their Taro chips are delicious I would kill to have the sauce at home with veggie snacks as well I am not a vegetarian but have grown a lot of love for this place Definitely support your local business as much as possible this one is my pick,CHAU Veggie Express
Max L.,2021-05-07,5,Love Golden Temple soup with quinoa and Namahata rolls Always fresh and great customer service Highly recommended,CHAU Veggie Express
Colene C.,2019-12-18,5,This place makes healthy eating easy Whether its their yummy tarp chips and addicting dip or their noodle bowls I always feel so satiated when Im eating here Even better its made with fresh ingredients so I dont have to feel guilty My go-to favourites are the taro chips the rickety rickshaw bowl and the golden temple soup The golden temple soup in particular has this rich curry broth that is great for the veggies to soak up the flavour You have a choice of rice or noodles but my fave is the noodles The only slight downside is how popular this place is You order first at the counter then find a place to sit Communal and bar seating But I love the food here so much its worth it Pro-tip they have a location on Granville Island Great to get take out and sit by the water,CHAU Veggie Express
Cherise B.,2021-04-04,5,This was our first visit and it wont be our last Oh my goodness the food is delicious and so fresh We had the Golden Temple Soup  everything everyone says in the reviews is true Its just perfect Im so happy we ordered two so I have left overs for tomorrow We also loved the Namaste rolls Nonla Crispy rolls and the Chocolate Peanut butter bar  WOW Were so excited to try more dishes and also get all of these items again And to top it off the customer service is amazing Highly recommend,CHAU Veggie Express
Michelle W.,2019-05-24,4,Ive been trying to cut down on my meat intake lately so it was about time to CHAU down on some veggies I was a bit confused walking in as I didnt know that you had to pay first and seat yourself Water and condiments are also self-serve While I do prefer paying after my main issue was in regard to the tables as they werent wiped down after customers left Our table fell victim to this as it had a sticky residue and some crumbs As I wasnt too hungry I only ordered a Namaste Fresh Roll 5.50 and had a bit of the Golden Temple Soup 14.25 The Namaste Fresh Roll was pho-nomenal Having recently had one across the stress this roll knocked the other out of the water Absent of meat this rolls flavour is fully embodied in the lemongrass steamed tofu mung beans crispy shallots and wheat centre and roasted peanut sauce among other ingredients I certainly have to highlight this sauce because it was thiccc and had actual peanuts in it Of course I smothered my roll in it down to the last drop In other words order this dish For the meager amount of the Golden Temple Soup that I tried it packed quite the punch The aroma of the turmeric coconut curry was intoxicating and only surpassed by its rich complex flavour This and the Rice Fields Bowl appear to be the largest in portion size and are the most expensive but neither dish seems like it will leave you feeling too bloated While I enjoyed the rice noodles and the beancurd I didnt care much for the taro which was too large and dense for my liking It was the only point in the meal where I missed the succulent bite of meat say a beef brisket It was my first time eating at this location and I fully intend on sampling more of the menu to write a more fulsome review When I went to the Granville Island location I had the Rickety Rickshaw and it was pretty good from what I remember though Id imagine the portion size is smaller than this locations Next up for me will be the Rice Fields Bowl and the Namahata Fresh Rolls Until then CHAU for now,CHAU Veggie Express
Sunny T.,2020-10-18,5,Staff were friendly and all covid measures were in place The coconut drink really blew me away,CHAU Veggie Express
Sandra W.,2020-09-05,5,Wonderfully surprised I wish I could eat here everyday I love their nutritious green smoothies and yummy menu after a long day of hiking and tennis Was beautifully plated and safe measures were taken and luckily wasnt too busy We sat outside on the patio and the service was great,CHAU Veggie Express
Chloe C.,2020-04-23,5,Went here another time before COVID hit and even then the bento boxes were limited to just takeout I also got a bunch of frozen items to stock up which was a good call since restaurants all shut down a couple of days later Again the items are quite pricey but you can tell that the meals are made with care and they taste like authentic japanese home cooking They also make me feel really healthy which is always a plus Bento Box 5/5 This bento box was literally amazing and I could not have been happier with my meal The bento of the day was tofu isobe which was basically tofu carrot and daikon wrapped in deep fried seaweed In essence it was a sushi roll without rice The taste was unique and was very light and refreshing despite the seaweed which was not oily at all There was one slice of sweet potato which was good and there was also some sort of vegan fish cake which was absolutely delicious There were some other accompaniments like shredded carrot and burdock which were good but nothing mind-blowing The bento also came with brown rice and some sort of japanese plum thing which I didnt like Yam and Black Bean Zucchini Loaf 5/5 This is probably my favourite frozen item from them to date This was similar but the better upgraded version of the Yam and Black Bean Loaf I got last time This loaf tasted wonderful The flavours are mild but unique It has quinoa yam puree and black beans and I think the zucchini was a thin pureed layer on top Im not too sure where the zucchini was Im slightly confused but it was tasty so its all good It was a tad mushy but thats probably because it was frozen and the ice inside melted I really enjoyed this Kabocha Gratin 5/5 This had the same filling as the kabocha croquettes that I last time except it doesnt have the breadcrumbs and it has quinoa in it Other than that it still has the chickpeas and pumpkin puree with a thin crust on top Again the flavours were mild but it tasted really comforting Kabocha Croquettes 3.5/5 These croquettes were different from last time in that they tasted nothing like pumpkin Instead it tasted like tomato sauce and the inside was reddish-orange It has like one chickpea and one red kidney bean inside and some dried tomatoes It probably has pumpkin puree to hold the whole thing together but you just cant taste it Its not bad but its not the kabocha croquette that I loved last time Misleading advertising Vegan Gyoza 3.5/5 These would have been perfect except there was something in the filling that tasted like cilantro and I hate cilantro or whatever that herb was These gyozas are huge and have a generous amount of filling which consisted of lentils and spring onions The dumpling wrapper was great as well Its just a shame about the cilantro Chickpea and Millet Nuggets 3.5/5 This was an interesting take on a chicken nugget Obviously the filling was soft and mushy on the inside but the flavour was decent though pretty mild like most of their other items The breadcrumbs were not as crispy as I would have liked them to be and the outer layer was hard and crunchy not in a good way Overall it was okay but I probably wont be getting them again Tempeh Chili 3/5 This was a little disappointing The tomato sauce was a little acidic perhaps due to it being a frozen item The taste was too strong and overpowering and left a strange taste in my mouth afterwards There was no tempeh in it and I feel cheated The eggplants and mushrooms in the chili tasted weird and not fresh I know it was made a while ago but still and I would not get this item again Garbanzo Stroganoff 3/5 This was also rather disappointing The sauce tasted weird not sure if its because it was frozen and the mushrooms tasted weird Note to self dont buy frozen items with mushrooms eggplants or tomatoes in them It came with chickpeas carrots celery and mushrooms Again it was just okay and I would not get this item again,Tama Organic Life
Suzan L.,2019-02-01,5,Amazing place Vegetables are fresh and decor was absolutely adorable The owners are kind and welcoming Had the daily bento special which was a bowl with some patties pickled vegetables gomae brown rice quinoa and more It came with a bowl of the best miso soup I ever had the secret is apparently that they make it with a splash of soy milk Everything was tasty and blew me away Especially the spicy mayo sauce on top of the bowl That was something else I will definitely be back for more food and produce,Tama Organic Life
Samantha W.,2018-03-29,5,This place is sooooooo adorable They sell fresh produce dry goods sauces etc and all types of cute handmade things like unique slippers handmade by Japanese seniors They also have a vegan menu that you can eat in or take out I tried the rainbow wrap it was honestly SOOOO delicious The sauce they make and put in it...so fresh and flavourful Plus all the veggies in the wrap were organic and the wrap itself was gluten free and house made I cant wait to try everything else on the menu The owner and employees are so friendly Such a cute place I love it here,Tama Organic Life
Matt B.,2019-12-05,3,I came for lunch and ordered the large bento box 17++ Reasonable portion with lots of different dishes mostly cold different than most Japanese places The main dish in there was a squash dish that was tasty Very healthy options  low oil low salt low fat I dont dig the organic thing  it aint healthier nor is it more environmentally-friendly so I dont like paying a premium for no benefit But despite this gripe the meal was tasty,Tama Organic Life
Lauren L.,2015-08-08,5,Tama Organic Ethical Kitchen and Van Soba have a natural and healthy working relationship When I am able to make my way across three cities to get here for the Bento Box I dont ask what is in it I just order and know that it will be wholesome healthy and delicious I crave this food and the fact its all organic and vegan is a big plus Dont forget to have the soba Both are around 15 and it takes some time to get it ready to serve before you can eat It is very much well worth the wait Here patience is truly a virtue Healthy Japanese food at its best More people should learn about macrobiotic foods,Tama Organic Life
Michael H.,2017-03-28,5,Just want to thank hiroko-san the owner for her great work and passion for healthy natural eating She is such a friendly and informative lady She was happy to educate us with her tips and tricks My girlfriend and I commute from richmond to purchase some of their products We especially love their handmade natto japanese fermented soy beans and eggs that are hand picked from 60 or so happy chickens at a local farm They also make snacks and lunches there which are all such high quality with very generous portions Were happy to find such a gem at their new location Strongly recommend for anyone who is looking for a grocery store that has your health in mind first,Tama Organic Life
Darylle J.,2017-05-23,5,Wow Ive lived within walking distance for more than half a year and I wish I knew sooner that they served vegan Japanese lunch I will definitely be a regular here This place is the bomb Go support this local shop and their delicious nutritious food ,Tama Organic Life
Shila B.,2015-08-12,4,Lately Ive been drawn to hole in the wall places as they proved to be treasures to me This was a treasure that I was drawn to Its small menu was of decent size I loved the mini grocery store Customer service was awesome It was nice to eat somewhere and not have to worry about dietary restrictions,Tama Organic Life
Lo B.,2019-02-18,5,Discovered this place after visiting the farmers market and was blown away by the quality AND quantity of products this little store has Ive been looking for alternatives to the likes of TT for so long but gave up on ever finding an east Asian let alone specifically Japanese grocer that carried local organic and fair trade goods The owner Hiroko is as friendly and knowledgeable as it gets and I cant wait to come back to try more stuff as well as one of the amazing-looking bento boxes She also is very anti-plastic so if you come in with your own containers she will happily fill them and reuse the baggies,Tama Organic Life
Jenny G.,2019-07-25,3,Been here approximately seven times usually for lunch Bought dried beans and seeds also Service and prepared food is very good and price is  They have some very unique and interesting products for sale Unfortunately one was a dried up expensive specialty lotion They also took over a month to obtain one of the specialty enzymes so I canceled The store has a musty-humid atmosphere because most of the store is healthy organic produce There are magazines to read that arent usually seen in stores Think of this place as a health food store without the pills They have their own organic Natto which is very hard to find,Tama Organic Life
Simon K.,2013-03-19,4,Thanks to Larry ended up finding this place and you could call this your hole-in-the-wall organic mini produce mart Located on the backside armpit of the Ethical Kitchen this place can definitely be hard to find I had no idea where I was going but the map led me here and I walked around and eventually found it If you find the Ethical Kitchen its there off to the left side and a little door guides you into this warm cozy place When you enter and if there are people ordering food you maybe in for a roadblock of people at the doorway This place is tiny cramped has a small kitchen that they cook up soba noodles in the front with the cash register and extends in an elongated way the store is long for what it is and they make use of every space they have available The Japanese lady has a great happy smile to her and greets everyone who comes through the door For the size you will be amazed how much stuff is crammed in here Many items are labeled in both English and Japanese as this store is definitely tailored to the Japanese crowd she did mistake my dear for a Japanese person as her eyes were wide open and you could see excitement in her head from coming in to see they serve soba noodles here We did try the noodles here and brought back the plates and they even asked for her name We definitely will come back based on the warm hospitality and the food served here it is a hidden gem and if you dont see it you wouldnt believe it,Tama Organic Life
Fil C.,2017-11-27,5,The vegan bento was an amazing collection of flavors and textures which was completely unique The ladies serving lunch were super friendly and we had a pleasant conversation about Japanese food After finishing lunch I bought some apples from their collection of local organic produce,Tama Organic Life
James P.,2017-11-25,5,Nice little organic cafe Lots of macrobiotic and vegetarian dishes Good tea Lots of Japanese food supplies Quality attentiveness local produce The owner is very friendly and sweet,Tama Organic Life
Anabel C.,2018-05-06,4,I was looking for a vegan eatery near PNE and found Tama Tama is a small and cozy place  Sit down and eat on a picnic bench and get to know your fellow neighbour  I had the Nato burger bento box while my little one snacked on sugar peas Both of us enjoyed the food she picked away at my bento box too I especially liked the produce You can sit down to eat and then buy the necessities i.e fruit veggies teas and raw chocolate,Tama Organic Life
Jason F.,2015-11-11,5,Tama is the place to go when youre looking for healthy not to mention authentic Japanese vegetables and plants like shiso and really great service The staff remember you well and offer free samples of food too If you dont live in North Vancouver it can be a bit of a trip but its well worth it,Tama Organic Life
B T.,2015-03-15,5,The staffs were very friendly I had reserved a bento box the day before and went to pick it up along with an amazing homemade amazake rice pudding which I was allowed to try on the spot The 10 vegetarian box was good and made with local organic ingredients This store also sells quite a few selections of local produces as well as fish chicken and Japanese products,Tama Organic Life
Veronica V.,2020-02-06,5,A fantastic spot that opened in 2019 Excellent high quality cocktails that will hold its own against any hipster cocktail bar and really really excellent food and service The flatbread is hands down the best Ive ever had anywhere Crisp thIn topped with just the right amount of deliciousness Their wings are FANTASTIC Everything is quite good I introduced my brother-in-law to this place and now he is a regular He swears their steak is the best in the city so I definitely must try that on my next visit,Arike Restaurant
Rasheed B.,2020-02-06,5,Excellent The vibe the service  the food Girlfriend even said best onion rings Ive ever had and the Oxtail Boudin...OMG So good as was the goat dumplings did not photo We came for the Dine Out Vancouver experience however their main menu looked so yummy Im glad we decided to sample a few items off the menu and shared everything I believe thats the best way to go with their menu Were already planning a double date night as we want come back here soon Definitely check it out as I believe its a hidden gem Considering how much food we ordered including a drink each the bill was under 85 I was surprised we had the whole restaurant to ourselves even though we arrived at 19:30 on a Wednesday,Arike Restaurant
Natalie T.,2019-09-26,5,I wasnt sure what Nigerian food was going to taste like however Arike had been mentioned as top new restaurants to check out in some food blog so I thought this place was worth trying I went with my food squad which was perfect because we got to try a good variety of dishes I highly recommend going with more than 2 people or fast all day so you can order a ton of dishes lol This place is located on Davie street super close to Denman street There is no restaurant parking but there is a paid parking lot behind the restaurant Our server/owner of Arike was very friendly and gave us recommendations on dishes and took the time to explain how the dishes were made We were told that their concept was more of a modern twist with authentic flavours which is different from the homestyle curries/stews that typical traditional Nigerian cuisine consists of Im personally not a fan of those hearty/stew type dishes so I was happy with their innovative Nigerian menu We ordered the following fried habanero corn fritters free range chicken wings had a subtle kick to them cassava fries pulled oxtail  cured pork belly flat bread fried jollof rice sooo good apparently it takes hours to make...they create a chicken broth from scratch which takes hours and then they slowly cook the rice in this broth)w grilled beef striploin skewers the meat was very tender spiced goat dumplings milo icecream pof pofs All the dishes were presented beautifully and were seasoned well The highlights for me were the corn fritters they were these mini fritters but full of flavour with a little bit of heat jollof rice and the milo icecream The pof pofs were like little fried mini Tim bits which was good to have with the icecream If its just you and another person I would say just get the icecream because they give you a huge scoop Between the 5 of us we didnt even finish it because we were pretty stuffed I would go back again if I was in the area and I would recommend this place to friends Food was interesting with bold flavours and I appreciated the great service The only draw back for me was that it can get pretty loud...we were next to a rowdy table where they really loud think busy pub noise level At times our group had to yell and had to repeat what we were saying However we came on a Friday evening so thats understandable So maybe come either earlier in the evening or on a week night if you are concerned with noise level thinking for the elderly/people who dont like super loud places All in all a great new place,Arike Restaurant
Guerric H.,2019-03-22,5,Wow This place is fantastic When I heard a Nigerian cocktail  food bar would be opening up in this spot I had no idea what to expect  Id never tried Nigerian food and any new restaurant is a bit of a gamble But Arike turned out to be everything I hoped for and more  its the chance of finding gems like this that make me always want to try new places to eat To start with the place blends classy restaurant style and nice bar vibes so it feels like it would be a great place for both fun drinks with friends and nice date nights All the staff were super friendly too apparently its mostly a family  friends business and you can tell the folks all know each other and get along well The bartender whipped up a nice dark  stormy that was on the lighter side in terms of alcohol punch which was good for a weeknight I really came here to try out the food though and this is where I was very nicely surprised Unlike a lot of places all the portion sizes here are modest  and yet I did not leave hungry by any means The food portions meant it was easy for me to try a whole bunch of things at once and let me tell you they were all delicious The goat spoon Its literally a spoon with tender flavourful braised goat meat and a deliciously complex sauce dabbed on top that had a hint of something very intriguing that I couldnt quite figure out Habanero corn fritters They may be fried and crispy and quite small on the outside but theyre creamy and flavourful on the inside and theyre sprinkled with the perfect amount of salt too I went for one of the most unusual-sounding flatbreads the leg of lamb with suya and onion sauce because I love trying new and different things and I was rewarded The sauce on the flatbread was really fantastic  you dont see onion sauces often but this one perfectly complemented the cheese that went along with it The crust was light and crisp and the meat itself rounded out the whole thing with that umami taste people love And even after all that I had room for dessert so I went for the pof pofs These things are like the grown-up version of timbits  crispy fried shell powdered with sugar and cinnamon on the outside creamy and gooey dough on the inside and a nice honey sauce to daub them in as you eat them I could not have been more impressed I love places that give you room to try a variety of dishes and the atmosphere was perfect for the kind of timeslot and crowd theyre aiming for Arike is a fantastic addition to the neighbourhood  welcome and best of luck Ill definitely be trying to drag friends here with me soon,Arike Restaurant
Daisy I.,2019-07-02,4,My sisters and I stumbled upon this place while vacationing in Vancouver and looking for a place to eat near the English bay beach We were super excited to go since we come from Nigeria and its a Nigerian cuisine inspired menu First of all although the food is inspired by Nigerian cuisine the actual taste was not much like what youd get at an authentic Nigerian restaurant But for what it was the food was delicious Our favorite was the suya wings by far Jollof rice was good but had too much palm oil for my taste Also tried the goat dumplings but that was not as impressive as the wings For dessert we had the puff puff and they tasted more like timbits than the airy yeasty Nigerian puff puff The ambience of the place was really cool with nice music and drinks Staff were also very nice Ill be back but mostly for the suya wings D,Arike Restaurant
Allison Y.,2019-05-21,4,This new West African inspired restaurant on Davie was a pleasant treat on a Thursday night First things first Im the realest the food was delicious I went with a friend whose family is Nigerian and she confirmed that although not authentic the dishes were scrumptious The jollof rice came with really tender suya beef skewers but be aware that the rice has a kick of heat The cured pork belly and pulled oxtail flatbread had a beautiful thin crust and was balanced by creamy bites of soft cheese and mild cherry tomatoes The cassava fries came with a few nice sauces I really enjoyed the ata din din pepper sauce We had pof pofs for dessert which came with a ginger honey sauce mint leaves and cinnamon sugar It was a nice sweet treat but I dont know that I would order it again The texture on the inside was a borderline mushy There was only one server for the whole restaurant which definitely affected the speed and attentiveness of our service He also went out for a smoke break in front of the restaurant for a few minutes around 9 not too sure how I feel about that Bill came out to just over 60 including tax and tip and I left full but not stuffed I think Id come back again once or twice more to try some other flatbreads but itd be nice to get another front of house staff member so as to reduce the workload,Arike Restaurant
Carol T.,2019-09-24,4,Nice chill vibe on a Friday night We made resos but there were smaller tables still available My friends and I ordered a lot from the menu We started with the jalapeño frittatas They were these little Smalls of fried dough The waitress said they are freeze dried jalapeños ground to a powder and incorporated into the dough Tasty little things when you get a hint of chili at the end Oxtail flatbread was tasty though a tad on the greasy side The fried rice with suya beef was tasty Its cooked in chicken broth and a tomato base The beef I found quite thin and expensive at 4 per skewer we added extra so each one of us had a skewer The goat dumplings have a unique flavour that I am not sure I love The dumpling wrappers are nice and chewy though The milo ice cream is creamy and smooth They want really well with the pof pofs Just wished they were bigger They are the size of a quarter of a Timbit,Arike Restaurant
Mia O.,2021-01-23,5,Contender for favorite restaurant in Vancouver The veggie dumplings in tamarind curry is absolutely divine and legitimately authentic My Nigerian mother-in-law approves The meat pies alone are killer and satisfy We basically now order for any and all major occasions Brava,Arike Restaurant
Kayla J.,2019-09-30,5,Arike was a great find on our anniversary get away week Great service and DELICIOUS food We had the goat spoons oxtail flatbread Jollaf rice with beef skewers and the goat dumplings The flavors are perfectly balanced Would recommend it all,Arike Restaurant
Pamela F.,2019-06-22,5,I discovered this restaurant when I was researching places to easy on our vacation and the reviews and menu from Arike got us really excited weeks in advance of our trip We went on a Monday and were the only people in the place Whats wrong with you Vancouver From the drinks to the hospitality to the food of Roman and Sam we were wowed from the first sip of our Sazerac to the last bite of pof pof My husband is a fan of west African food but me and my daughter had never tried it We ordered the wings and goat spoon for appetizer the jollof rice with beef steaks with cassava fries and leg of lamb flatbread We were also brought complimentary shots that were a crisp and refreshing compliment to the gentle to spicy dishes So much flavor such originality so delicious We ordered pof pofs and hand made salted caramel ice cream Im not a big dessert fan but even I couldnt resist digging in after the first pof pof melted in my mouth The ice cream was luscious just the right mouth feel We had to order another round if pof pofs immediately One of our absolute favorite meals of our trip We want to kidnap Sam the chef and bring him to Los Angeles where he would be booked every night relax we told him about the kidnapping he was ok with it In the meantime VANs and visitors get yourself to Arike as soon as you can Why not right now Thanks again Arike we were impressed and delighted,Arike Restaurant
Daniel G.,2019-03-28,5,Unique dishes bursting with flavour My friends and I tried every item on the menu and the food just got better and better with each bite A fantastic meal from beginning to end Dont even get me started about how delicious their Milo ice cream was Staff were extremely friendly and attentive The restaurant has a very cool vibe too I will be back very soon I cant wait until their patio opens in the summer and I can enjoy some delicious drinks and snacks Thank you for the wonderful experience,Arike Restaurant
Bob T.,2019-05-18,5,Excellent Subtle and unique flavours We really enjoyed the braised goat spoon and abacha salad as appetizers The goat meat was tender and perfectly accented with din din pepper sauce peanut crumb and pickled onion The salad was fresh julienned cassava with habanero dressing We followed with the cured lamb flatbread Again perfectly seasoned,Arike Restaurant
Jeff K.,2019-03-28,4,this was my first visit the bartender is off the rail the chef is pushing great food and nice twist on the regular fare please think of this place as a great little cocktail and food place with spectacular dishes please swing,Arike Restaurant
Lynn S.,2019-07-03,5,This place is a gem Both my companion and I loved everything we had she the goat spoon and goat dumplings me the corn fritters and eggplant flatbread My cocktail was lovely the service was excellent and the weather was gorgeous for sitting outside Give it a try,Arike Restaurant
Barney S.,2019-05-03,5,Suuper delicious food Been twice now and both times absolutely great Nice cocktails and real nice atmosphere definitely coming back,Arike Restaurant
Rodney B.,2019-07-14,5,Our Nigerian friend steered us to this place and we loved it The goat spoon and habañero corn fritter appetizers were great as were the jollof rice nicely spicy and the goat dumpling main courses Highly recommended,Arike Restaurant
Leona M.,2019-08-17,5,The best ice cream ever Food was delicious and staff friendly Love this place I highly recommend visiting it Hidden jewel,Arike Restaurant
Karen O.,2019-05-19,5,I am fortunate to live just two minutes away from Arike This is a spectacular restaurant Everything Ive enjoyed there has been outstanding Flavours are intense and layered Few things I have found in Vancouver compare And the service is exceptional All the staff are attentive without being obtrusive They remember what drinks they served you the last time and who you were with How many places offer that kind of personal attention This is not just a neighbourhood gem it is a city gem And I agree with Daniel G The Milo ice cream is at the top of the list of superb ice creams Get there before the word gets out and it becomes so busy you wont be able to get a reservation for weeks which would be the best thing in the world for this most deserving restaurant,Arike Restaurant
Todd B.,2019-06-18,5,Excellent food...well seasoned...vegan burger and summer salad Flatbread was also great Two thumbs up,Arike Restaurant
Jack W.,2021-09-28,4,=== 1 VERDICT/VALUE A hidden gem behind London Plaza along Westminster Hwy 4 Stones may be the place to go to if youre vegetarian or if youre like me looking for good eats that at least seem healthy...without being too healthy  === 2 FOOD Deep-Fried Radish Cakes 8.24 nice but different  the radish texture is different than what is traditionally found in Chinese restaurant  it falls apart easily The very thin batter  coating is nice as is the peanut/hoisin sauce that accompanies the dish Kung Pao Vegetarian Chicken 15.39 for the combo the sauce is a little salty and thick but whatever makes up the chicken tofu is a pretty good approximation The combo includes rice soup of your choice a small amount of chow sum vegetable and tofu Vegetarian Beef Brisket Stew 15.39 for the combo so it doesnt look like brisket and the tendon substitute looks just as odd but the taste is pretty good  I just may turn vegetarian at this rate  The sauce was just right without being too salty and a good choice with the rice The choice of soup vegetable or herbal  the former being tomato/carrot/rice-based and the herbal is actually good  the smell of dates/figs overpowers the nose initially but the taste is refreshing === 3 SERVICE For takeout it is good in English and Mandarin and reasonably quick === 4 ENVIRONMENT The restaurant is only open for takeout at the moment but it looks like it would have accommodated a number of small tables in pre-pandemic times With the open space wheelchairs and baby strollers fit just fine parking is a little interesting there are two dedicated spots upfront but you need to get out of your car to move the objects presumably there to reserve the spots in order to park your car The rest of the complexs lot is very small,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Drea S.,2021-09-16,5,Always tastes like real meat it surprises me The flavours are amazing and the sauce adds a special kick Despite it only being take out right now you get additional 10% off Who wouldnt want to take it Its amazing,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Rochelle &apos;Shella&apos; T.,2021-04-03,4,This is a good place to have good tasting vegetarian food Personally I am not vegetarian but I have been trying to minimize my meat intake My sister recommended this place to try out since shes been coming here with her fiance I love their food Theyre very tasty reasonably priced and comes in good portions If all vegetarian food tastes as good as this I could convert as a full pledged vegetarian,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Chloe C.,2021-05-07,5,Radish cakes still my favourite item from here Seaweed mushroom bean curd roll comes a close second Gyozas here are good considering that its pretty hard to find good gyozas New vegan bbq pork baos are tasty the pork is super tender and melt in your mouth but I wish the bao was fluffier Crispy vegan oysters are okay nothing special Its hard to find vegan food in Richmond so this is a decent option,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Bryan F.,2021-08-28,5,Every time this place is amazing They have some of the best food out there Their range of options is fantastic and their customization is equally so We love their Kung Pao Bean Curd and Spicy Szechuan hot pot but everything weve had there has been fantastic Also the staff is excellent I cant recommend this place enough,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Andrew C.,2019-07-29,5,4 stones gets 5 stars Why you might ask  Purely vegetarian cuisine that is super flavorful not too salty and extremely creative with their dishes  Priced right for the amount of food you get What to get in order  Kung Pao Veg Chicken Yep had to roll my eyes at the thought of this one but this definitely takes the cake Super flavorful fully packed with veg chicken  Grilled veggie unagi Looks like unagi tastes like unagi but its tofu and bean curd Wow  Eggplant and Basil Standard eggplant and basil dish because who doesnt want veggies at a vegetarian restaurant  Veg Beef Brisket Stew This was an interesting take on beef brisket Chewy beef brisket with fat and tons of flavor This is a place with a small parking lot and a place where you need to order at the counter pay and then find a seat Nothing fancy but super delicious Would definitely go back again if in the Richmond area,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Jason F.,2021-03-04,5,This is one of the best restaurants in Richmond right now The food is rich and satisfying the prices are reasonable they do not ask for tips when picking up as it should be and the staff are very fast and professional The ingredients are also very natural and will energize you not leave you in a food coma afterwards Whether youre vegetarian or not youll love the entire menu Im tempted to get a job in the kitchen just to steal the recipes for myself but until then Ill continue to order from here every 3-4 weeks at least My only recommendation for the restaurant would be to switch to paper takeout packaging where possible Number 5 plastics are not allowed in Richmond recycling bins currently,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Stephy Y.,2020-01-30,2,Pretty high ratings for a vegetarian place Maybe Im not a vegetarian and dont really see why it came out with 4/5 on yelp They do have plenty of options to choose from with many meat dishes that were made into a vegetarian version I did want to try their fried chicken nuggets but it wasnt on their menu anymore So dishes I tried  Satay Beef with Gai Lan 3/5 Now the beef tasted nothing like actual beef but thats ok The dish itself renders 3 out of 5 because it was just ok in terms of flavour Im not looking for it to replicate the actual dish cause you just cant Beef is beef and mock beef wont be the same  3 cups of burdock  Veg meat 1.5/5 The burdock itself tasted ok The sauce it was in wasnt pleasing to the palate and didnt really speak 3 cups flavour to me I wasnt sure if the veg meat was mixed in with the burdock but I didnt see on its own The veg that this came with was just cabbage  Veg beef brisket stew 2/5 This was a tomato base stew with had veggies and mock beef Id say this had variety but again the base was just ok Spicy sauce with veg beef brisket pot 2.5/5 This one had the same ingredients as the stew above however this one had a spicy pickled base and for some reason if you get this in a combo you wont be getting the side dishes You will however still get rice and soup We got the combo and you get a choice of white or brown rice chinese herbal soup or mix veggie and some side dishes I thought I knew what chinese herbal soup was but let me tell you they werent joking when they said herbal So be ready for some herbal taste if you decide to order this I wish I had gotten the veggie option cause it was too much for me So overall I wasnt expecting this dinner to replace my meatful dinners but rather allow me to enjoy meatless nights while still enjoying the flavours of dishes I liked However it did not live up to expectations I wont be returning as I could have spent 70+ having some delicious meatless dishes elsewhere,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Pam C.,2018-09-22,5,I visited this place with Zi Y on a Friday night at 5pm They werent busy right at 5 as they just opened for dinner hours but became busy around 6pm We were first timers at this famous vegetarian restaurant in Richmond and Im so happy we came We decided to bring our families here next time because their fake meat actually tasted really good I havent had meat in so long that I forgot what real meat tastes like so I cant compare it with real meat but Ill say that this fake meat doesnt suck They served side dishes with a few choices of soup They also offered white or brown rice We ordered quite a few dishes for two petite girls lol Everything we ordered was delicious Staff were so sweet as well I will definitely bring my friends and family here I miss this place already,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Amita J.,2018-05-29,3,This was an interesting place It looks sketchy from the outside inside however is ok The service was odd did not realize on their menu it said we had to order at least one item per person so instead of giving us time to look a little more at the menu she just kept making things off and saying we could order something small which was still 9+ dollars Felt like we were feeling rushed All of their prices seemed very off based on what you get with the combo meal  full entree The food itself was mostly really good We ordered the Kung Pao chicken which was the best thing and most popular ordered Definitely recommended We ordered a tofu dish as well which was good but unfortunately do not recall what its called The stand dumplings were ok but the gyoza was delicious,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Ayaka H.,2017-10-01,5,Its easy to give 4 stones vegetarian a solid 5 stars Their lunch combos are priced above average at 15 but their portions are large quality is high and ingredients fresh I tried the veg fish on cream sauce with rice combo with veg fried chicken and both were insanely delicious enough to make me plan my next visit so that I could try everything on the menu The goji berries herbal soup that comes as a side with the combo is so nourishing and I want that recipe so I could have it everyday Most menu items are vegan and the rest are vegetarian Veg food doesnt have to be boring look at the attached pics I would guarantee even non vegs would enjoy it Dont forget to check out their fridge where they have assorted veg meats for home cooking As a side note hole in the wall type place with excellent service and clean bathrooms,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Cherry W.,2019-02-17,5,Love this place My dad and I have been coming for over 10 years It appears that recently they may have change management They now require you to pay over the counter Most of their options are vegan friendly Very flavourful and more Taiwanese style vegetarian cuisine It is on a pricier side but there are a fair amount of food You can see that they put a lot of love and effort in their food Totally recommend even if you are not vegetarian,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
John V.,2018-01-10,4,Great little restaurant Food taste great and with good service and large portions They dont really take reservations but call 30 mins ahead and they will try to save you a seat The parking is terribly cramped and limited The decor is an afterthought This place is all about the food Go for the food bang for your buck Dont go for crappy parking situation small restaurant,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Patricia F.,2018-01-05,5,Ive been wanted to go here for ages Reading all the reviews got me excited so I had high expectations and they delivered Family run spot in Richmond Good prices as well and lots of selection I cant wait to come back and try more food We ordered 3 dishes between 4 people and had leftovers One hot pot a spicy fried mushroom dish SO GOOD and the wintermelon soup SO GOOD Be careful of the floor its extremely slippery,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Najat S.,2019-03-30,4,4 Stones was the highlight of my dining experiences in my weeklong visit to B.C Tucked in the unassuming Minoru Plaza it is a mere 500 meter walk from the Richmond-Brighouse transit station I arrived at 7:30pm on a Thursday night so service was speedy Ordering is easy at this counter-service joint simply browse the two double-sided laminated menus make your selection and pay If you order a combo it comes with your choice of soup rice white or brown a side dish and fruit The SPICY BEAN PASTE VEGAN BEAN CURD FISH pictured on the placard on the counter was my selection Within ten minutes my side dishes soup and rice arrived followed by my steaming hot main dish fragrant with fermented bean paste and ginger I loved the contrast of textures between the springy bean curd fish chewy mushrooms and crunchy Chinese celery My vegetable soup was flavourful and the side of slightly cooked spinach with vinegar was a great counterpoint to my spicy main dish The portions were generous and I appreciated the fruit topped with sunflower and pumpkin seeds If you are vegetarian and love Chinese food dont miss this place,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Shila B.,2018-10-06,3,Atmosphere There is a bit of a hole in the wall vibe however I recommend coming here as you will not be disappointed Service Not friendly The instructions for ordering the items itself was confusing which may have added to her slight hostility toward me Price Market value Food For a vegetarian place there was a lot of selection and I was slightly overwhelmed...in a good way The portions are large and respectable The fake vegetarian fish on rice was actually surprisingly decent,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Leena S.,2017-11-11,3,Very good vegetarian restaurant The food tasted really good The kungpow chicken is a must I have not had vegetarian Gyoza since I become a vegetarian Best Gyoza ever The udon noodles were good as well Very large portions Food was great but have to give only 3 stars given the service was very poor But I guess thats expected at those smaller types of restaurant,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Phi G.,2019-09-10,2,My friend told me of this Chinese vegan product that would fool any meat eater So I set out to find it 4 Stones came up on yelp search I never go to Richmond but I decided to make the trek The place is small and a tight entrance for those with strollers scooters or wheelchairs The pictures make it seem upscale and nice Lets be honest its a room with some dated tables and chairs Everything is vegan even though the pictures look like meat I was so excited that I ordered the fried chicken nuggets and beef brisket stew The 3 item appetizers is not appealing Pine nuts on fresh fruit is fucking gross The tofu I didnt try The veggie was the only decent part Fried chicken nuggets looked amazing I was so stoked And then I ate one My biggest issue is the crispy/crunchy deception You look at the pictures and think ohhh yeah kfc xtra crispy goodness But what you actually get is a disappointing thin layer of crust that doesnt crunch The beef brisket stew tasted like its meat version I could not tell the difference The fake beef looked convincing too But after awhile I got this weird queasy feeling Its the same feeling I got when I found out Subway essentially used micro plastic in their breads I stopped loving everything and was concerned these Chinese fake meats might have stuff in it that isnt healthy I was wasteful and didnt eat 1/4 of anything And I didnt dare take it home Im pretty sure the waitress was offended but I wont return,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Emme P.,2017-03-18,4,Pretty good vegetarian restaurant Kung pao chicken-3/5 Very flavorful the fried part got a bit soggy near the end felt like there was a lot of reading Salt and pepper chicken 3/5 Flavor was a bit different from the traditional Taiwanese popcorn chicken but still good I dipped it in the Kung pao sauce,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Liza M.,2019-04-10,5,The best Taiwanese restaurant Ive tried in Canada Im so glad I made a trip out to Richmond I came with a group of 7 for a late lunch on a holiday We waited at most 5 minutes and ordered 9 entrees for a celebration Service was great but maybe because we ordered a lot right at the beginning Some of the entrees came with brown rice and herbal soup Overall a great experience delicious appetizers and entrees I would definitely visit again if Im in the area 1 Crispy Veg Cutlet w Curry Sauce on Rice  MUST TRY 2 Grilled Veggie Unagi  SUPER GOOD 3 Mushroom Seaweed Bean Curd Roll  SUPER GOOD 4 Kong Pao Veg Chicken with walnuts Just the right amount of crispiness and sauce 5 Tomato  Veg Beef Brisket Noodle Soup  as good as vegetarian beef noodle soup can get 6 Veg Beef Noodle Soup  tastes similar to tomato  veg beef brisket noodle soup 7 Burdock  Veg Meat Pot  comes with plenty of sauce thats great over rice Burdock adds an interesting and fun texture 8 Spicy Sauce w Veg Beef Brisket Pot  comes with plenty of sauce thats great over rice 9 Spicy Kimchi Chow Mien  this was served last The plate of noodles was garnished with cute fried circular vegetable It was great since long noodles and a circle are both great symbols of longevity good luck and fortune We were all super full by the time this came out so I dont think I appreciated this as much as I could have on an emptier stomach Complimentary side dishes come in a tray partitioned into threes 1 Mustard greens  really good served with sesame oil 2 Cherry tomato grape cantaloupe apple dried cranberries pine nuts and almonds 3 Aged/spiced tofu  could eat just this and rice for an entire meal,4 Stones Vegetarian Cuisine
Mateo D.,2020-07-07,5,Amazing service by Shefali Jess and Jaycobe Thanks guys and also great options Had a happy face and it was delicious Also shefali prepared me a Matcha latte also really good Thank you,Buddha-Full
Nicole B.,2021-01-01,3,Went to the North van location yesterday and feasted on some Vegan veg and drinks The bohemian bowl was okay fresh carrots beets lentils and brown rice with a decent warm sauce It didnt knock my socks off The green juice was tasty and comes in a nice sized glass bottle They have juice shots I ordered the fireball and gagged because it tasted like salad dressing so I took it home and poured it on my salad My daughter ordered the happy face smoothie and said it was delicious The avocado toast was okay but even the spicy was bland,Buddha-Full
Paula F.,2019-08-14,4,Wonderful little vegan vegetarian eatery next to the Quay My daughter and I are visiting Vancouver from California and just had a lite lunch here It was our first stop We throughly enjoyed it This eatery is environmentally conscious and minimalistic in waste Compostable to go containers are used for to go items and regular washable plates bowls and utensils are used for dining in There was one communal table and a few smaller tables inside and a small patio area outside in front The menu filled with yummy plant-based options adorned the wall as you walk in Choices included smoothies Acai bowls wraps Buddha bowls salads toasts sides shots teas and kombuchas A huge selection of pastries on display behind glass were also available They also had a menu option for dogs We chose the Berry Bliss Acai Bowl and the Bohemian Soul Bowl The Acai bowl came out in a reasonable amount of time The Buddha bowl took a little longer Both presented well with plenty of bright colors and tasted great Prices were a little high but well worth the price The ingredients were fresh healthy and locally grown and/or brought in Service was friendly and helpful We have a few more days in Vancouver We will definitely visit Buddha-full again before we leave,Buddha-Full
Josephine W.,2020-03-08,4,I dropped in to Buddhafull during the Hot Chocolate Festival as I was curious about their mushroom hot chocolate The shop is inviting and cute with lots of greenery and wood accents The drink I had was called Ancient Wisdom a raw dark hot chocolate with adaptogenic healing mushrooms and a light spice The rim had some sweet spices that was delicious I love dark hot chocolate and I could taste the mushrooms It worked quite well I would come back to try some of their other dishes Lots of healthy items on their menu,Buddha-Full
Meredith D.,2021-03-01,4,Have been in here a couple times and hadnt reviewed Recently grabbed take out from here with a couple immunity boosting drinks and ramen bowl Ill admit that vegan/vegetarian doesnt usually excite me but it hit the spot and definitely something we will shortlist going forward,Buddha-Full
Jessica W.,2019-11-28,4,Popped in as I was walking the neighborhood and looking for a healthy option A great storefront selling lots of local items so I loved looking around and finding some new local artisans Went to order and the person working the till seemed very friendly but during the lunch hour rush with a long line they were chatting long periods with each customer as I was about 4th in line when I went to order and many more coming in during my wait I get friendlyness but during the rush period on a weekday was a little frustrated Then it took over 15 minutes for the avo toast I ordered so I finally had to ask for it to go as I was due back for work and no longer had time to stay and eat The avo toast itself was wonderful  really great mix not just slabbing avocado on some bread so it was worth the long wait in the end and will go back in the future for sure just making sure I get myself a little extra time And the fact it came in a heart well that was overly adorable Also they had some amazing vegan desserts wish I picked one up,Buddha-Full
Brittany F.,2019-11-04,2,Ive been a loyal customer of Buddha-Full for years Back in the day it was somewhat of a cult following for yogis and health junkies but has recently become popular among the broader Vancouver crowd Im usually sucked into their Lobo smoothie and mint Nanaimo bar which are inconsistent in quality but good for the most part Today I decided to venture outside of the norm and have to say it was regrettable I got the pumpkin smoothie which is fine tastes like blended pumpkin pie and is overwhelmingly spiced with nutmeg The mistake was the raspberry cheesecake which was so stale I was pretty dissatisfied so I brought it back to the counter and the employee seemed annoyed by my complaint I asked to exchange it for a different dessert that was actually a lower price than what I paid but she said I had to get the same cheesecake I reluctantly agreed This second slice was even more rock hard than the first see picture I took one bite and left the rest Theres so many great healthy cafes and smoothie spots in Van now I dont see the point in coming back to here with that type of oversight and customer service Might have to leave you as a memory Bye-da-full wave-emoji,Buddha-Full
Nina S.,2019-05-31,3,I enjoyed everything here and feel great after eating clean but the prices are very high for the portions Value 2/5 Atmosphere 4/5 Service 3/5 Quality 4/5 13/20,Buddha-Full
Joyce L.,2019-08-23,5,I happened upon this cafe while I was in search for Two Daughters whose storefront appeared to be closed There was a sign on the fence indicating they were still accepting special orders so they were definitely still open for business I ran into some ladies who were looking to get pastries at the same shop and they let me know that Buddha-full also sold their goods and walked me there The decor of Buddha-full was super cute I didnt have a chance to Yelp this place prior to going so I wasnt studied up on this cafe I was happy to learn this place was fully vegan and there were just so many sweets and pastries to choose from Since this was a healthier place it appeared most of the sweets were sweetened with dates and natural sweeteners vs straight-up sugar The girl at the register was very helpful in recommending things to try I got the Mango Cheesecake Bar Sunflower Seed Bar and Golden Milk I think thats what it was called Everything was so good I also appreciated not having to pay extra for non-dairy milk Yay The sweets had just a hint of sweetness so they werent overpowering or exhausting Since they were made of whole food ingredients I found them to be quite filling and it took me quite a bit of picking at them throughout the day to finally finish them I wasnt even able to finish them after a hard run at Grouse Grind they were very filling I definitely will come back here the next time Im in Vancouver,Buddha-Full
Del A.,2018-05-19,3,My friends and I decided to visit this spot because we were in the North Van area and had seen pictures of the interior of this place Although we expected it to be more expensive than most places we were shocked to find out that all of their smoothies were 11 While they have a lot of options to choose from and the portion sizes are pretty large I still felt that it was a lot to shell out for a smoothie Regardless I ordered the Green Guru smoothie with cold-pressed apple juice + mango + spinach + pineapple + dates and thought it was good but nothing spectacular The staff is all lovely and friendly as well which is always a plus My favourite part of this café would have to be the interior  its one of the most aesthetic cafes that Ive been to and they even have adorable swings definitely instaworthy That being said I recommend coming once if you want a cute spot to have a smoothie and take shameless pics for the Insta but I probably wouldnt come back a second time given the steep prices,Buddha-Full
Michelle S.,2019-08-30,3,I want to give 3.5 star I ordered rainbow salad and I got a pre-made salad from the fridge It wasnt amazing but decent Wish they made the salad like they did with the bowl my friend ordered Will I come back Maybe,Buddha-Full
Kaitlyn P.,2019-03-17,4,Lovely vegan spot in North Vancouver right in Lower Lonsdale within walking distance to the Quay Great variety on their menu offering juvies lattes smoothies Avis bowls wraps soups salads Buddha bowls and baked goods I had the Ohana Luv Acia bowl and it was good but I noticed all their bowls have the same toppings which is disappointing because they all tasty different but look the same It would be nice if they put in some effort and were slightly different Also I wasnt impressed with the fact that they say bowls will be topped with seasonal fruit yet all I saw on mine was 2 slices of green apple and banana for that reason they get knocked down a star,Buddha-Full
Mikayla S.,2020-07-25,1,Really dont get the hype with this place its not that the food is bad but its fine Its nothing to write home about Most importantly they take SO LONG I was just talking to a friend about this place and she stopped going here because they take so long The procedures set in place for COVID are also not up to par the arrows on the floor are for how to exit and they dont enforce social distancing I ordered two simple smoothies from here about 40 minutes ahead of time When I got there they still werent made I literally got them 30 minutes later Thats simply ridiculous Theyre smoothies Ive worked in the restaurant industry for years this is not how they should function,Buddha-Full
Kate M.,2019-11-05,2,Love the decor and concept but yikes the day I tried this joint for the first time they werent properly staffed and the pricing is too much for what youre getting The woman at the till was clearly in training as she didnt know the product or what she was doing on the till but no one seemed to be taking the time to actually help her out The line up was building behind me quickly and then someone more experience hopped on to show this woman where things were on the iPad and what she needed to do I just asked what teas they had and the more experienced woman wanted this girl in training to take down all the teas from the shelf and let me smell them Although thats nice to do when youve got the time and dont have a pile of people waiting So as she starts taking them down off the shelf I let her know she doesnt need to do that and Ill just have an earl grey and a samosa The samosa was nothing special Ive had a much better veggie samosa elsewhere Indian oven for much cheaper For a plain earl grey tea and a samosa I paid 10 The tea cup was only filled halfway with water too no milk to honey no nothing to make it a little more special than a plain black tea I wouldnt go back here if Im being honest as it left me feeling really underwhelmed,Buddha-Full
Lara O.,2017-05-03,5,I have no complaints Space is beautiful love the communal tables Service was friendly and at a very reasonable pace for how busy it was  Food was delicious and presented so gorgeously I adore their commitment to local suppliers which they list for you to see It is a bit more expensive here but what do people expect for local organic food I for one am happy to support local businesses that support local suppliers and a commitment to organic vegan food My Buddha bowl left me happy and full I couldnt finish it all Hubs had the avo toast and it looked incredible he also said he didnt need anything more,Buddha-Full
Emily D.,2018-01-21,1,This is my first visit Very sad first impression/experience here I placed a pick up order online and paid extra to have a side soup and avocado and tofu in my sandwich I came in to pickup my order very excited to try a new place where I can eat with all my food allergies My order was ready on time and the service was friendly Restaurant has a nice layout and design ascetic I was given my order but had to ask for a takeaway bag odd since it was a  to go order I didnt look inside my take away box because I assumed my order was correct I trusted them When I got home I sat down to open/have my meal and saw a salad Well that was a waste of 3 I decided Id suck that up I went to have the sandwich and then realized the tofu and avocado that I also paid extra for was not included I was SO disappointed I also realized the bread was not gluten free Normally I dont like to complain or write 1 star reviews but after walking in the rain spending 28.88 for a sandwich and latte and feeling a little cheated I decided to call and see if they could remake my order When I called I spoke to the woman who took my name and looked up my order She obviously apologized and said I could have a free pastry next time Im in Thats when I asked about the bread because I was told by a friend who goes here often this was a gluten free restaurant When ordering on their site I saw gluten free vegan organic advertised and assumed it was safe to order Picture attached from website showing misleading info Her reply to me was that people who have gluten issues usually spend more time asking questions and viewing websites I completely understand that was my mistake but what a thing to say when THEIR kitchen staff clearly doesnt read an online take out order That statement really disappointed me and surprised me Since a free pastry wasnt what I wanted I am allergic I asked if they could remake my order Her reply was that the kitchen was closed and there was nothing they could do She asked for my phone number even though it would be on my online order and said the manager would call me tomorrow Since I cannot eat my dinner wasted 28.88 wasted my time and they wont remake my order...what I had WISHED they offered was a refund for the sandwich soup avocado and tofu My latte Im fine to pay for because it was correct and it was yummy Sadly this was not offered to me or mentioned In fact when I asked for this I was told the manager would call I would love to have a good experience here I understand mistakes are made we are only human and restaurants close at 7 PM/people have lives I expect a call from the manager tomorrow and hope I will receive my refund I will update this review with the outcome Really hope I receive a call tomorrow UPDATE never received a follow up,Buddha-Full
Sangeetha M.,2018-02-14,3,Tbh I went to take pictures on the swing The decor is really nice and who doesnt like to sit on swings There are many options for smoothies and it is very overpriced I didnt try the food It took quite some time for the smoothie to be made Overall Id go back to take some nice pictures but wouldnt for the smoothies,Buddha-Full
Thayssa S.,2019-06-11,5,Very healthy food and tasty I love their açai bowl Not done they way Im used to eat but definitely a go when Im home sick,Buddha-Full
Simon W.,2017-05-08,2,The place has got an eat-pray-love vibe to it I ordered their seasonal Buddha bowl for take-out which Im told is an Ahi Poke To my dismay I couldnt find a single trace of Ahi being Japanese for yellowfin tuna in my bowl I dug through the whole thing but was already back at the office so no chance to bring this up with the powers that be Rest of the flavouring was quite nice the highlight being the roasted yams which tasted like roasted yams Im not up to speed on the other trendy ingredients but I do know what tuna looks like when I see it  which I didnt They have an extensive misc home good selection of books candles olive oil and general gifts for the vancouver special They sell Tiffin carriers which Id totally use if I had lunch packed for me everyday  stainless steel just doesnt microwave that well but not to say I wasnt tempted Id just really like some Ahi in my Ahi Poke Is that too much to ask Probably a 4 star if its included I understand that its a vegan place but lets respect the meaning behind words and use them appropriately  Ahi means tuna,Buddha-Full
Jess S.,2017-03-05,5,Yup I love this place Its not huge maybe it is but its soooo busy but you can sit inside or outside Service is extremely excellent considering the amount of people that come and the turn around From the person taking our order to the one making it and they one clearing the dishes every single person was smiling and helpful We ordered the Heart Beet smoothie cold-pressed beet juice + raspberries + strawberries + pineapple pakoras and the GF The Fiesta wrap frijoles de olla + daiya cheese + avocado + tomato + cabbage + chilies Everything is super delicious and incredibly healthy The location is perfect a few blocks from the sea bus and Londsdale Quay We ended up leaving super full and picking up deserts vegan and GF for our brew tour I got the blueberry scone which was hot and moist AF I cant believe its GF Note they do run out of food We were there at 3 and the salad and wrap I wanted were sold out So get there early,Buddha-Full
Eric B.,2021-08-11,5,I loved the artichoke sandwich in a delicious ciabatta Great flavours nice patio in the back,The Arbor
Nicole G.,2021-11-09,3,This restaurant came so highly recommended and I had high hopes The verdict not bad Im committed to eating less meat so am going to be trying many of the vegetarian restaurants on Door Dash I ordered the Fried Oyster Mushrooms which were alright The portion was small for almost 13 pictured Also tried the Caesar Wrap I was intrigued by the fried artichoke but it was also just alright I got it with the vegetarian bacon bits I would order from them again to give em a second chance Am hopeful,The Arbor
Sofie P.,2021-01-25,2,Staff was lovely but was not a fan of my meal at all Ive been here twice now and both time have left disappointed I got the Autumn Harvest Bowl and didnt finish Not what I was expecting That said my friend got the artichoke sandwich and loved it plus they gave her a free dessert for her birthday Not sure this is the place for me but I wish it was,The Arbor
Chloe C.,2021-05-07,4,Dessert was probably the highlight of the meal I really enjoyed the coffee flan and chocolate brownie Tempeh was okay brussel sprouts were meh sunchokes were not it I remember the artichoke sandwich being pretty good might go back to try their burgers,The Arbor
Manbir R.,2019-12-12,4,I was practically dying to have a good vegetarian meal that not only satisfies my apetite but also doesnt make me feel too full Got to the right place i guess I loved what i ate  So we ordered a vegetarian wrap n tofu plus potatoes snack Nicely served and yummy in taste Drinks were many but we had non alcoholic beer n a lemon drink Would go again to try more stuff,The Arbor
Nicole B.,2020-06-04,1,I hate to give a less than satisfactory rating for a local business during our current circumstances but I have to say I was thoroughly disappointed with my take out today I ordered a southern fried vegan sandwich which I have always done The bread was dry I had to send a search party to find the fried artichoke that was buried in a bland mayonnaise sauce under a massive pile of shredded cabbage Its was huge It had no flavour and really skimpy on the artichoke Side note No oyster mushrooms on the current covid menu so wont go back,The Arbor
Chrissy S.,2020-08-18,5,My friend and I went to The Arbor for brunch on a Friday afternoon I loved the casual atmosphere and laid-back vibe The menu is vegetarian comfort food and includes everything from salads to burgers and pasta The drink menu features BC wines along with beer ciders and some signature cocktails They also have many non-alcoholic options We ordered the Cobb Salad and the Southern Fried Artichoke Sandwich Both dishes were delicious and packed with flavor and almost everything is house-made I highly recommend the Fried Artichoke Sandwich The artichokes are battered and fried perfectly and topped with eggplant bacon coleslaw avocado mousse spicy mayo and cheddar cheese If you are in the mood for a cocktail I recommend the Nordic Summer The Arbor patio is a hidden gem on its own If you have the opportunity to sit on the patio  take it They do not take reservations Our server was excellent and the food came out quickly They also took extra measures to make the place COVID-friendly Overall I highly recommend The Arbor and will be back,The Arbor
Chelsey H.,2019-10-13,5,Ive heard of this place but been hesitant to visit because all vegetarian restaurants make me think theyre too hipster and that meals could taste too foragey and green if that makes any sense Oh man the cauliflower island is hands down the most delicious cauliflower Ive ever had Better than Nuba Better than Mamie Taylors GET THIS CAULIFLOWER I was sad we had to share it three ways The fried oysters were super interesting Obviously by oyster they mean oyster mushrooms for a vegetarian place and it was a twist on a vegetarian replacement for kalamari or fried oysters Ive never had them but the sauce was tzaziki-esque Glad I tried them but not my favourite The artichoke sandwich they have is simply delicious The artichoke really tasted meaty without having any meat It was a perfect chicken replacement and the smokey eggplant bacon gave it a perfect southern flavour I did ask for hot sauce because I wanted some spice though their hot sauce is relatively flat That was the only disappointing thing The boy got tomato linguine and in my opinion it wasnt that special It had the foragey-healthy taste I wasnt in the mood for I aint so great with my pasta not having any meat If you arent either Id skip out I know the pinenuts and lemon gremolata were thrown in for texture but I wasnt a fan They had a dessert on special the plum and housemade ricotta A little tart A little funky It was good but nothing to rave about and Id probably skip out on in the future but nice to try The space is extremely cute and whether youre a vegetarian who has never liked meaty textures or a meat eater who just is exploring the vegetarian scene youll definitely find something to enjoy Id recommend going with friends so you can try all the different items if you are feeling like exploring,The Arbor
Lindsay K.,2019-05-05,2,Pros Nice patio Good drinks wine  a non-alcoholic cocktail Good appetizer  lightly fried broccoli called broccoli popcorn although wish it came with a dipping sauce Cons Ordered the burger which itself was just okay The side salad was extremely lame only greens with an oily vinaigrette and the fries were also just okay Pretty disappointed I was craving a good salad and expect a side salad at a veg restaurant to be amazing Service wasnt really great  recognizing it was a busy Saturday night it still could have been better Took especially long to ask for bill Overall a decent evening but was a little disappointed in the food and the service I dont think Ill be going back,The Arbor
Natalie T.,2019-02-11,5,I had been wanting to check out this place for over a year after having great experiences at their sibling restaurant The Acorn which is only a couple of store fronts away I came on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and we luckily beat the afternoon rush Shared the pulled jackfruit steamed buns deep friend oyster mushrooms and the famous artichoke sandwich I had pretty high expectations prior to coming and I felt that this place met my expectations on taste service and value I loved the deep fried oyster mushrooms perfectly seasoned fair portion size nice and crispy The dill dip was so good I felt like it was a really good calamari in terms of flavor and being crisp except it was mushrooms I would definitely order this appetizer again The pulled jackfruit steam buns were interesting flavor was good texture was different but I enjoyed it I am glad I tried it The southern fried artichoke sandwich was really delicious The size was generous and really tasty I dont like artichokes but how they cooked it I didnt care that I wasnt eating meat Service was great servers were efficient and friendly with a laid back vibe I think the food is fairly priced and I was happy with all of the dishes that we ordered I look forward to coming back and trying more off of the menu I would have to say this is my favorite vegetarian restaurant in Vancouver in terms of best taste and value,The Arbor
Abigail S.,2019-01-20,4,The Arbor is a spiffy if tiny veggie haven on Main St with its on-trend white subway tiles and cool modernist sculptures and good smells coming from the kitchen including the likes of fried artichokes and mushrooms pizzas and broccoli popcorn etc A Buddha Bowl/patchouli/burlap kind of vegetarian restaurant it is not Even during the late lunch shift around 2pm on this weekend afternoon the flow of customers was steady and a small wait was necessary Parties larger than 4 might find it a bit too cramped although I hear that the outdoor seating in the summer dramatically expands the capacity The menu really takes meatless cuisine seriously I had the tacos plate which was an extremely filling and tasty composition of batter fried cremini mushrooms slaw poblanos lashed with an avocado crema and cashew creme fraiche assembled in corn tortillas The fried mushrooms acted as the meat supplement and were really delicious Its a personal preference but for my taste there was too much of the cashew cream on top Otherwise I felt satiated long after the meal Our server was just fine and happy to split the group bill up into individual orders without a complaint The fried artichoke sandwich is apparently the crowd favorite and I look forward to returning some day for a go at it,The Arbor
Deborah H.,2021-08-04,5,The fried artichoke sandwich at The Arbor is quite possibly the best sandwich on the face of the earth Full of artichokes cole slaw eggplant bacon Who knew you could make bacon out of eggplant Worth a trip across town to pick up this sandwich for lunch,The Arbor
Sara B.,2021-04-01,5,Great food Wonderful service Beautiful back patio Love the harvest bowl Ive been here many times in the last few years and never been disappointed Grabbed take out tonight to support one of my favourite local restaurants in this awful time Thanks Paul,The Arbor
Imma M.,2019-12-19,1,Visit the Arbor if you feel like getting yelled at by a server My spouse and I attended the Arbor to purchase a gift card or gift certificate for a friend We like the food at the Arbor and because we live nearby we find ourselves there once a month or so often brining along friends or family Today when we approached the counter I started to request information about a gift card or gift certificate I began to say Hi would it be possible to before I was rudely cut off by the man at the desk He raised his voice interrupting me mid-sentence to say Ill be with you in a minute Needless to say my spouse and I were put off enough that we left and will not be returning With his condescending and unfriendly behavior the staffperson at the front counter not only lost our business tonight in terms of the gift card we hoped to buy but our business in the future and the business of our friends for whom we were buying the gift card It wouldnt have bothered me to wait a few minutes while he finished whatever he was doing he was not serving another customer or on the phone when I approached the counter Unfortunately he didnt even have the patience to let me finish my sentence The Arbor is becoming widely known for good food and bad service This is not the first time weve had an experience like this at the Arbor and we intend to take our business somewhere that were treated with a modicum of respect I tried to post on their Instagram account about my experience and they blocked me Worst service Ive ever experienced in Vancouver Do yourself a favor and stay home,The Arbor
Steve V.,2019-11-10,4,The Arbor is in a space that has held some great restaurants and some really crappy short-lived ones in between I feel the Arbor is a good fit and theyve done it justice to make it hip and approachable The food is good As these kinds of places tend to go you have to accept the they higher cost of the ingredients not being bought from Costco and Vancouver rents are passed on to you so dont be shocked by small portion size I liked what we ate and would go back if i wasnt loking to really fill a big hunger void My family being people in their 40s-80s all liked it too so that tells you something One thing Ive sort of notice in non-meat establishments is the seeming need to fry everything to bridge the gap between veg and meat As of late I havent easily been able to equate eating vegetarian to eating healthy and I did find that a bit here,The Arbor
Nicole M.,2019-09-18,5,Accidentally stumbled onto this patio while on a desperate search for a stroller-friendly place to have a glass of wine in our new neighborhood Was even happier when I learned their happy hour started at 3pm Staff was friendly and accommodating while I waited for my husband to join Didnt realize it was a vegetarian place until my husband pointed it out I tried the jackfruit steam buns and they were a delicious treat Ill be back to explore more of their menu soon,The Arbor
Sarah M.,2020-11-29,5,The artichoke sandwich is a blissful experience like no other I wish I could eat it at least several times a week I get it with the hazelnut cheese which is truly delectable Very few times in my life have I felt so deeply passionate about 2 pieces of bread with stuff in the middle but wowee This is really something else Long live the artichoke long live the Arbor,The Arbor
Graham M.,2020-02-24,2,My boyfriend and I used to really like this place and their food is quite good but the last time we went he wanted his burger without the mayo-like special sauce as he cant really tolerate mayo or anything like it The server sheepishly informed us that while theyd been able to negotiate that with the kitchen this time they couldnt really guarantee it going forward I guess making something my boyfriend can eat compromises their artistic vision We havent been back since and I dont see that changing unless they get things under control,The Arbor
Bunny L.,2020-07-05,5,It was my first time in the Arbor I did not even know they have a lovely garden in the back The Caesar salad came out quickly Good portion and tasty Thumbs up,The Arbor
Sara A.,2017-11-02,5,Wow this is definitely my new favourite vegetarian restaurant in town We have the following Tacos  layers of flavours Love it Jackfruit Buns  so flavourful Burger with Eggplant Bacon  the texture is amazing Chocolate Mousse  decadent Peppermint Tea  even the tea is nice  strong The service was friendly and welcoming,The Arbor
Cherry L.,2021-10-29,3,I am a long time customer of CHAU and enjoy their food and drinks Their items are usually always great however I am very disappointed with their execution this time Included is a photo of the coconut shake which I requested for it to be no ice because it was a very cold night This is unacceptable behaviour from a restaurant I know of no other place that under-fills their drinks like this due to a no ice request If this is the case I think they should list the amount of ml on their menu to let the customers know the exact amount they are purchasing Or at least inform the customer at point-of-purchase I am actually already very surprised that I found one piece of coconut meat in this takeout drink because Ive received this drink multiple times without a single piece of coconut meat when I get it to go they usually put two pieces when you order for dine in For a drink that is charged at 6.25 plus taxes I am very disappointed in the amount that was given It is barely half full Overall the taste of food and drinks is great but I am very disappointed in the restaurants execution and inconsistency,CHAU Veggie Express
Marc L.,2021-10-22,5,just a lovely place to be and the food is very carefully prepared clean nice patio fun staff,CHAU Veggie Express
Thu N.,2021-10-29,4,The menu is diverse with different types of vegetarian dishes compared to other vegetarian restaurants The food is mixture of Vietnamese  Western styles and tastes so good The space is a little small and more suitable for small group gathering  under 5 people,CHAU Veggie Express
Van F.,2021-10-07,5,Today I witnessed a couple of losers harassing the Victoria Street staff for upholding mask/passport policy So unfair You guys are doing a great job keeping yourselves and community safe by following provincially mandated health orders My lunch was delicious,CHAU Veggie Express
Domenic P.,2020-08-29,5,The golden temple soup has healing powers I truly believe it is the best soup Ive had It is named after the famed abode of god a chromed out holy architecture that looks like a wet dream of Salvador Dali who was once quoted saying I dont do drugs I am drugs Which is what this soup is drugs You crave it and it makes you feel better The song Love Is Only A Feeling came on through the speakers after It was placed on my table On this particular day I didnt have plans of coming here but the guy in front of me was turning left and it took me until right now to realize that was no ordinary man that was my spirit guide Woscar that lead me to this soup Please consider offering bibs as my white shirt now has many turmeric stains,CHAU Veggie Express
Marina B.,2020-09-28,5,I absolutely love Chau I cant believe that for years I held off trying it because I was under the false belief that I wouldnt feel fully satisfied with it being vegan I finally tried it one evening with a vegan friend and boy was I wrong The moment the golden temple broth touched my lips I was hooked Ive been coming here regularly ever since Even my meat-loving boyfriend loves it Im so obsessed with the golden-temple soup that I cant not order it every single time My favourite way to have it is with the quinoa which sounds like its going to be too healthy tasting but it just compliments the soup so well The texture of the quinoa is so nice in the soup and it doesnt really absorb the broth too much I also like to get extra veggies between my boyfriend and I we get one order of extra regular veggies broccoli cauliflower carrot and one extra order of yams The extra veggies makes it all the more hearty and I always have leftovers Even though I always get the golden temple Ive tried lots of other things too Everything so far has been delicious Ive tried the diving for pearls soup  which is really tasty the fresh rolls the tempeh one is my absolute favourite the baisou chips must get the coconut shake so yummy must try and the peanut bar you absolutely must get this The ice cream is also really yummy my favourite is the green goodness I dont usually like vegan ice cream but this is so delish Chau is a great place for a quick casual healthy bite for vegans and non-vegans a like The service is always friendly and prompt and the food is always delicious and consistent It also a great place for takeout which is especially important in these times I find in a lot of other restaurants the food either doesnt take out well or you end up getting screwed on the portion size or preparation So Its really nice to find a restaurant where you know you are going to be equally satisfied when choosing takeout and never have to worry about feeling ripped off Im sure Ill be back again next week for my favourite golden temple soup,CHAU Veggie Express
Jay K.,2021-09-30,1,they let me come in wait in line for 10 min then once i started ordering takeout told me i cannot order without a vaccine passport i did show my vaccination card and was wearing a mask they couldnt accept my order by phone either because it wasnt working ive been a loyal customer ordering at least weekly for the last two years and im not going back,CHAU Veggie Express
Sydney K.,2021-09-04,5,Just moved to Vancouver and was recommended this place to eat by a friend and it did not disappoint Im vegan myself however I was with my omnivore parents and they were also blown away by how amazing the food was Came here twice and tried different dishes and all of them were astounding Will definitely be my go to place for a meal out,CHAU Veggie Express
Patricia F.,2020-09-01,5,I love this place You wont miss meat here My boyfriend is a self professed meat eater and he regularly suggests grabbing dinner from here which is a huge statement Theyve recently knocked down the wall that seperates the spaces and makes the place feel bigger For Covid measures they have stickers on the ground for you to wait to order Plastic barriers have been set up on tables as well For the food I have never had anything not 100% delicious here My favourite is the Golden Temple Bowl which is creamy from coconut milk and packed with flavour The rickety Rick shaw noodle bowl is also very delicious The tarp chips come with an interesting dip At first you may think its a peanut dressing of sorts but once you taste it its very different Definitely recommend this place on any day,CHAU Veggie Express
Glen M.,2020-01-20,5,OMGawda I left this place full as a tick First off its a very popular restaurant along Victoria st 10 minutes after we sat down it was packed Every table filled including counter space so get there early or prepare to wait IF you do have to wait the wait is worth it Cute place All veggie Cant go wrong Well the food  to start we had two different kinds of delicious spring rolls which were very good and these amazing tarot I think thats what they were chips with a dip that was awesome So good And my main meal was the very good Golden Temple something soup that was in a delicious coconut broth with tons of veggies incl a couple veggies Ive never tried before all in a massive bowl Just know youll get fed well and itll be delicious You should try this place,CHAU Veggie Express
Ly W.,2019-12-22,2,Ive tried coming to this restaurant twice and both times it was packed I finally got to try this restaurant today and was excited to see what the hype was about Honestly it wasnt really anything special or spectacular You order at the front and find a seat and food is served to you The servers were great The ladies were so friendly and came by to collect our dishes even though its half self served and asked if everything was okay We didnt find the gentleman at the cashier the owner very friendly No smile or friendly conversation or thank yous when we went up to order Prices are around 11-14 and portion is decent BUT I wasnt full when we left I ordered the Rickety Rickshaw and it is like a normal Vietnamese vermicelli bowl but without meat It had carrots cucumber radish bean sprouts bean curd and four spring roll bites While the ingredients were fresh I found the dish very ordinary The spring rolls were hard like slightly stale and I found the proportion was a little off I was done the spring rolls and was left with a lot of noodles and veggies My bf ordered the Tropical Rainstorm and the coconut was overwhelming If you like coconut then you would like this dish My bf didnt like it because it was on the sweet side and tasted kind of like dessert We also tried the thai milk tea and coconut pandan icecreams We liked how the icecreams werent very sweet but the flavour was light The coconut pandan icecream was quite delightful but I couldnt taste the Thai milk tea flavour for the Thai milk tea icecream Would we come back Probably not If we were craving vegan or vegetarian dishes we prefer the MeeT restaurants because their dishes are flavour bombs,CHAU Veggie Express
Elvi R.,2020-08-16,4,Ive been here multiple times and have ordered pretty much the same thing every time We love the Namaste Fresh Rolls  Nonla Crispy Rolls We order these to start every single time we go For the main I really enjoy the Midnight Swim Bowl with thick rice noodles Its super flavourful ans a little spicy Very delicious We also enjoy the Golden Temple Soup when its a rainy day The Baisao Beach Chips with the tofu dip is great to grab and have as a snack later on,CHAU Veggie Express
Masaki F.,2021-10-03,2,It was pretty good before but now all potions got smaller and the taste didnt same at all of course the price was higher disappointed but I guess time goes by,CHAU Veggie Express
Sayoka H.,2020-10-08,4,Been a big supporter of CHAU Veggie since their open Never once have I had a terrible experience and the food is delicious My got to is their golden temple soup with a side bowl of rice My goodness bowl of hot soup on a crispy cold Vancouver day is heaven in my mouth Portions are on the bigger side but hey you get your moneys worth Their Taro chips are delicious I would kill to have the sauce at home with veggie snacks as well I am not a vegetarian but have grown a lot of love for this place Definitely support your local business as much as possible this one is my pick,CHAU Veggie Express
Max L.,2021-05-07,5,Love Golden Temple soup with quinoa and Namahata rolls Always fresh and great customer service Highly recommended,CHAU Veggie Express
Colene C.,2019-12-18,5,This place makes healthy eating easy Whether its their yummy tarp chips and addicting dip or their noodle bowls I always feel so satiated when Im eating here Even better its made with fresh ingredients so I dont have to feel guilty My go-to favourites are the taro chips the rickety rickshaw bowl and the golden temple soup The golden temple soup in particular has this rich curry broth that is great for the veggies to soak up the flavour You have a choice of rice or noodles but my fave is the noodles The only slight downside is how popular this place is You order first at the counter then find a place to sit Communal and bar seating But I love the food here so much its worth it Pro-tip they have a location on Granville Island Great to get take out and sit by the water,CHAU Veggie Express
Cherise B.,2021-04-04,5,This was our first visit and it wont be our last Oh my goodness the food is delicious and so fresh We had the Golden Temple Soup  everything everyone says in the reviews is true Its just perfect Im so happy we ordered two so I have left overs for tomorrow We also loved the Namaste rolls Nonla Crispy rolls and the Chocolate Peanut butter bar  WOW Were so excited to try more dishes and also get all of these items again And to top it off the customer service is amazing Highly recommend,CHAU Veggie Express
Michelle W.,2019-05-24,4,Ive been trying to cut down on my meat intake lately so it was about time to CHAU down on some veggies I was a bit confused walking in as I didnt know that you had to pay first and seat yourself Water and condiments are also self-serve While I do prefer paying after my main issue was in regard to the tables as they werent wiped down after customers left Our table fell victim to this as it had a sticky residue and some crumbs As I wasnt too hungry I only ordered a Namaste Fresh Roll 5.50 and had a bit of the Golden Temple Soup 14.25 The Namaste Fresh Roll was pho-nomenal Having recently had one across the stress this roll knocked the other out of the water Absent of meat this rolls flavour is fully embodied in the lemongrass steamed tofu mung beans crispy shallots and wheat centre and roasted peanut sauce among other ingredients I certainly have to highlight this sauce because it was thiccc and had actual peanuts in it Of course I smothered my roll in it down to the last drop In other words order this dish For the meager amount of the Golden Temple Soup that I tried it packed quite the punch The aroma of the turmeric coconut curry was intoxicating and only surpassed by its rich complex flavour This and the Rice Fields Bowl appear to be the largest in portion size and are the most expensive but neither dish seems like it will leave you feeling too bloated While I enjoyed the rice noodles and the beancurd I didnt care much for the taro which was too large and dense for my liking It was the only point in the meal where I missed the succulent bite of meat say a beef brisket It was my first time eating at this location and I fully intend on sampling more of the menu to write a more fulsome review When I went to the Granville Island location I had the Rickety Rickshaw and it was pretty good from what I remember though Id imagine the portion size is smaller than this locations Next up for me will be the Rice Fields Bowl and the Namahata Fresh Rolls Until then CHAU for now,CHAU Veggie Express
Sunny T.,2020-10-18,5,Staff were friendly and all covid measures were in place The coconut drink really blew me away,CHAU Veggie Express
Sandra W.,2020-09-05,5,Wonderfully surprised I wish I could eat here everyday I love their nutritious green smoothies and yummy menu after a long day of hiking and tennis Was beautifully plated and safe measures were taken and luckily wasnt too busy We sat outside on the patio and the service was great,CHAU Veggie Express
Ben R.,2021-11-22,5,Always such good food service presentation and overall experience Couldnt recommend this restaurant enough,Sula
Jennie Y.,2021-08-11,4,We had a lovely dinner here last week The chatpata sev puri crispy wheat papdi stuffed with chaat topped with spicy potato sev was amazing and packed with flavour The butter chicken and lamb curries were also great Their garlic naan was fried perfectly extra crispy on the outside but still fluffy on the inside We sat inside and felt like we were transported to a tropical island with the open air windows high ceilings and eclectic decor,Sula
Jurn L.,2021-06-30,5,I absolutely love Indian food but unfortunately I dont get to eat it as much as I want to because fiancé isnt much of a fan So I was super happy to check out Sula with a girlfriend as it came highly recommended by our mutual girlfriend Between the two of us we shared the Butter Chicken and Gobi Aloo along with Garlic Naan for me and Tandoori Naan for her Everything was super delicious We chose a Medium spicy level for the Butter Chicken and it had the perfect kick to it The Naans came out warm and fresh The Gobi Aloo tasted great as well We had enough leftovers for dinner Overall it was a yummy lunch Also received great service Highly recommend,Sula
Lyndsay P.,2021-05-15,5,Truth be told Ive eaten out far more than my reviews point to...Covid is exhausting and it hasnt been top of mind BUT this place I only popped in for a happy hour snack and drink I will return for the full menu that looks amazing The snacks were so yummy but the best part about this place was the warm and welcoming atmosphere The servers were so incredibly kind I havent had service like it for as long as I can remember Just felt like I was visiting someones home Comfortable with hosts that were attentive and just so genuine Will return for a full meal and will update then too ,Sula
Aerica W.,2021-04-22,5,Love the interior here and even their cutlery cups/glasses were beautiful Staff were super friendly and accommodating Nice and cozy place for drinks and conversations 1 oz for 7 and 2 oz for 10 Came here for their Happy Hour menu drinks I came here on a Saturday Sat  Sun Happy Hour 2-5pm weekday hours vary I believe roughly 3pm or 4pm to 6pm Our order Indian Summer tequila pomegranate pink salt lime Unique and tasty drink as I dont see pomegranate drinks often or ever anywhere else Western Ghats vodka cherry lemonade sparkling water  Im personally not a fan of cherry but my friend said it was delicious and refreshing with the added bubbles from the sparkling water Nagpur orange grapefruit soda lime  I really enjoyed this one it has a neat citrus-y blend with a kick Tandoori Wings 9 super flavourful and juicy wings with a tasty charred flavourful Highly recommend this  Beautifully presented drinks that pack a punch Might as well 2 oz everything Also tried their chaat savoury snacks on a separate visit which are popular and typically served at road-side stalls or food cars in India My order Samosa Chaat the samosas were HUGE and very very filling so I would recommend sharing if youd like to try other dishes Spiced potatoes onions and peas are stuffed in a savoury pastry Its also loaded with a lot of toppings house-made chutneys sauces Indian yogurt and my personal favourite which were these crunchy mini-sticks on top sorry I dont know the name of it Sev Puri wheat balls w various fillings Hollow crunchy wheat balls which already taste great by themselves and are filled with a bunch of stuff as well including chickpeas onions cilantro pomegranate etc Highly addictive bited-sized and vegan Vada Pav fried potato dumpling in bread The bun is amazing its toasted on butter and has a great chewy texture The fried potato dumpling tastes like a mini samosa to me Also very filling Overall everything was very flavourful This restaurant definitely pays attention to details  their food flavours decor service everything,Sula
Marci H.,2021-11-13,5,Very warm and inviting room excellent service and amazing quality food The cocktails are creative and delicious the prices are reasonable Will definitely be back again and again,Sula
Krista R.,2021-11-06,5,The service and quality of dining at Sula is fantastic I love all their dishes but what makes them unique is their Indian street food the Railway is a family favourite dont miss out,Sula
Matt B.,2020-12-16,5,Really happy to see a second Sula location this one even closer to home And for them to open during the pandemic they must be doing really well We ordered takeout one evening and went to pick up the food when ready 45 mins later Menu is nearly identical to the original location with an exclusive vegan section of items I am happy to report theyve replicated the original location in terms of the awesomeness of the food We ordered the veg jalfrezi gobi aloo and the bhindi okra all medium-hot which was perfect spice level might be a bit much for some  as well as a couple tandoori rotis ask for no butter to ensure its vegan Total 53 after tax which is a little spendy for Indian food but totally worth it for the high-quality of the food  and we had enough for one for meal the next day Wonderfully complex flavours not too oily rich without being overwhelming and generous portions And their dishes have loads of veggies and arent too saucey or thin like many Indian places Overall Sula remains our favourite Indian restaurant in Vancouver Top recommendation,Sula
Jeannie Y.,2021-08-31,4,Flavours in Sula is better than the previous restaurant I had samosa chat and cheese and garlic naan The samosa was just lightly warm I was hoping for fresh piping hot and crispy I also hoped it be spicier However I did enjoy the varied texture profiles between the chick peasfrom the sauce and the topping of thin red onion slices  Also enjoyed the sweetish/sour/salty flavour notes all in one dish The garlic and cheese naan was yummy I bought butter chicken to take home I asked for spucy level just a bit above medium Although flavorful I received mild to medium spiciness Id ssy the ambiance and staff were courteous I would go back again,Sula
Michael L.,2021-02-20,5,Came here during Dine Out Vancouver during COVID I reviewed their web page prior to booking and it was nice to see the COVID protocols they had in place including temperature checks on patrons When we arrived they did not do the temperature checks on us nor on any of the other patrons that followed They have installed large plexiglass screens between tables for COVID protection and all the staff wore masks I was satisfied with the COVID compliance so now onto the review The room is beautifully re-done from the old Reef restaurant that used to occupy the space for the past 21 yrs We ordered off the Dine Out Vancouver menu 30 per person knowing that this would be a lot of food we were not disappointed We ordered the spinach potato onion pakora and the chicken tenders as appetizers Both were great tasting and both were large portions For the main I ordered the chicken tikka masala hot spice level coconut rice and the naan The dishes came out in beautiful dishes and again the taste of each were great The naan was sooo good and they did not hold anything back on the hot spice level I barely got into the main before I was full...again nice large portion size For dessert we sampled the mango coconut rice pudding and the almond pistachio rasmalai cheesecake These were nice refreshing desserts after such a large meal They provided us take out containers and we left with meals for 2 persons The service was exceptional I liked that they brought a large pitcher of water and left it on the table for patrons to fill their glasses We had a chance to meet the owner and he explained how he selected this location trying to find an area with no Indian establishments in close proximity Sula is a welcome addition to the Main St  Mt Pleasant restaurant scene It was a very positive food experience and I am happy to recommend Sula if looking for Indian food in the area,Sula
Eileen R.,2021-10-04,5,Delicious A great place to satisfy your taste buds Im going back Butter chicken with garlic naan and a dish from the chaat menu Im going back to try more,Sula
Regina P.,2021-11-09,2,The food was presented very nicely but not as tasty as expected The service was quick but when I tried to add a seat to our reservation and requested for inside dining they told me they were completely booked up So we were stuck in a little corner on the patio while there were plenty of seats inside that would have accommodated 1 more person I think for this reason wont be back,Sula
Chloe C.,2020-12-21,4,Somewhat expensive but decent portions Food tasted fresh Channa Saag 4.5/5 Asked for mild but was more like mild-medium Very flavourful with lots of chickpeas I enjoyed this Bhagare Bhaigan 4/5 Asked for mild but this one wasnt spicy at all unlike the Channa Saag which is strange Sauce is tomato based and was nice although I wasnt a fan of the grated coconut on top Baby eggplants were nice and tender but I still prefer regular eggplant Eggplant Bharta is my favourite and Bhagare Bhaigan doesnt come close has nothing to do with the restaurant,Sula
Danny K.,2021-08-23,4,What an excellent new addition to the Vancouver ethnic restaurant scene A mixture of delicious Indian curries and street food In particular the dhai puri was amazing as was the saag paneer In addition excellent service thanks Mithu food handling and atmosphere Only minor thing if any is the food lacked a bit of depth of flavor that you often find at classic Indian restaurants May be the result of catering to a more North American pallet Overall amazing and well definitely be visiting again and taking our friends,Sula
Aditya G.,2021-10-30,2,Our server was great The ambience is very good But thats it  it was all downhill from there The girl at the front was really not in the mood to be there and behaved as if she was tired and pissed The food is the main disappointment  this is not Indian cuisine This is what these people think is Indian cuisine and their interpretation is way way way off the mark I cant even call this whitewashed food because it was just tasteless garbage with good plating,Sula
Yuka T.,2021-07-13,5,I visited this restaurant because I wanted to try Indian curry It was very delicious The naan had a nice garlic flavor that matched the curry very well I had a chicken curry milder it was good because it had a rich flavor Also the waitresses were cheerful and made the meal enjoyable,Sula
Jerome D.,2021-10-28,5,This was a fantastic dining experience  it starts with extremely friendly staff  great atmosphere and a lovely fire in the stove keeping the restaurant warm on a cold  wet day  our server was also excellent  suggesting food to try  and all was very tasty satisfying and beautifully presented will definitely recommend and return,Sula
Nye M.,2021-10-28,2,Ordered the portobello mushroom appetizer Asked specifically that it not be spicy It was spicy The server then began to explain why they dont ask for spice levels with appetizers as they come as they are Would have preferred she tell me that as I ordered it not when she checked in with us after we took a few bites Their Instagram page makes the food look amazing Its doesnt quite look like that in person Frankly overpriced for what it is,Sula
Jack D.,2021-08-01,5,Incredible laid back service with delicious and authentic dishes Great patio good music and lots of unique cocktails Must try Dahi Puri,Sula
Chris P.,2021-07-27,4,Drove into Vancouver heading to an Asian restaurant it was marked Open but when we arrived it was closed due to Family Day We were so hungry we checked out what else was close by Sula had great reviews so headed there We were greeted by a pleasant waitress name Katika  hope I got the spelling correct I asked for her recommendations and they were absolutely delicious The food matched the service My only suggestion for the restaurant is to serve filtered water as the water had a lot of chlorine,Sula
Annika G.,2021-10-10,5,4.5/5 so good while we visited vancouver this was our favorite spot woweeee the spring rolls were so good even my BF who isnt really a fan of vegetarian food usually was caught off guard by how delicious everything was the service was smooth and friendly the ambience of the restaurant was really nice  the decorations and the overall restaurant was beautiful we got there at a good time around 11:30AM not long after it opened and luckily we did so as it got so busy as were finishing up so make sure to come early while there we tried the charcoal lemonade spring rolls papaya salad and lettuce wraps we only tried from the appetizers as we werent too interested in the entrees but man were we satisfied and full from the 3 appetizers each was was delicious and did not feel heavy i felt super healthy after eating all of it the charcoal lemonade was very interesting it did not stain our teeth and tasted like an earthy lemonade that was not too sour moreover it tasted even fresher with mint leaves that i borrowed from our appetizers i usually dont like eating out but this spot i would love to return to,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Emma W.,2021-09-07,5,Wow I am so happy my friend recommended this new spot during my recent visit home to Vancouver Do Chay Yaletown is a beautiful and hip spot equipped with hanging plants serving up healthy and clean Vietnamese dishes and cocktails We stopped by at 11:30am on a Friday and were the first people there we made a reservation just in case They have great seating options inside and out My friend and I shared the mango salad black truffle tofu and eggplant dish Everything was delicious but the tofu was definitely our fave It was perfectly crisp and the sauce it came with was perfectly light and flavored without being overwhelming We also got black lemonades which was a wonderful accompaniment to the meal I will definitely be back,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Elvi R.,2021-05-27,5,Decided to go to Do Chay in Yaletown for Mothers Day dinner Everything we ordered was delicious We started with the spring rolls and the wings I can probably have 10 orders of the wings Theyre so good super crispy and I love the sweet and spicy sauce that theyre coated in Before becoming vegan lemongrass beef was a go to for me so I was super excited to try their lemongrass tofu Loved the crispy shallots on top Was very flavourful I would order it again It was a very generous portion We also ordered the Bún Bò Huế but got it with rice noodles instead of the spaghetti looking noodles It was very flavourful and very spicy in my opinion The waitress said it wasnt but it definitely warmed me up The kind is spicy you want to keep eating I went back last weekend and was so happy again Definitely recommend this place if you like Vietnamese food Bon Appétit,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Siimmy G.,2021-11-13,5,Amazing Vegan/Vegetarian cuisine in YT We tried four different vegan dishes and the flavour was amazing The vegan chicken wings made from mushrooms were definitely my fav and apparently the most popular The menu does change quite a bit I was told so Ill def be back,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Jacqueline W.,2021-08-06,5,So amazing I cant back the very next day Theres a reason why this place won best new restaurant 2020 You wing miss meat eating here Everything is so flavourful The spring rolls are crispy yet not oily The fish sauce it comes with makes the dish come together so well Also tried the black garlic braised eggplant Absolutely delicious I love eggplant now 10/10 on all dishes,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Be F.,2021-07-20,5,We stumbled on this place while trying to find Meet and ended up having a way better meal We had the Prosperity Dumplings  complex tender and flavourful in a lovely broth the pho  very authentic with the surprising win of avocado slices and tofu skin and Uncle Hings Wings breaded oyster mushrooms with a sweet sauce Fabu Wed order all three again but want to come back and try everything else first starting with the lemongrass tofu and the vegan Vern,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Cy W.,2020-11-19,5,Delicious food that is kind to the environment We have been a fan of the restaurants Kingsway location so we are excited that it opened a second location right in the heart of Yaletown which is in need of a place offering delicious and inventive vegetarian food We were looking for a light meal and decided to go Do Chay for some healthy dinner For appetizer we were curious about the Uncle Hings Wings which are deep fried breaded mushrooms in a sticky sweet and sour sauce It definitely taste very similar to chicken wings We also got the Spring Rolls which comes with mustard green cut into perfect wrapping shape and herb basil/sage For entrees we shared the Black Garlic Eggplant served with yo choy and rice We cant wait to go back and try out all the other creative vegetarian dishes they have on the menu,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Charly S.,2021-02-04,5,Spring rolls served with greens for wrapping and Black Garlic Eggplant/Tofu  these are two of my all-time favourite foods The spring rolls are crispy outside and chewy inside  wrap in the accompanying greens and dip  soooo delicious just like Vietnam The Black Garlic Eggplant and tofu is a savoury sweet smokey dish served with perfectly cooked fluffy rice and a few greens is Vietnamese comfort food perfect for cold wet Vancouver nights The mango salad is delicious but I prefer these types of salads a little crunchier/less soft The Pho is the best vegan pho Ive had  rich yet smooth and clean filling and colourful This Yaletown location is bright and cheery nice patio out front If youre looking for plant based Vietnamese look no further Enjoy,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Chloe C.,2020-10-02,5,This is my dads new favourite vegan spot The food was so delicious but the portions were definitely small for the price The decor is really amazing though Uncle Hings Wings 5/5 This was the best deep fried mushroom dish Ive ever had We all couldnt stop raving about it The batter is crispy and not greasy and the mushrooms had a great texture The flavour was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy Black Garlic Eggplant 5/5 This was so flavourful The eggplant and tofu was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing The textures and flavours were on point Satay Noodles 5/5 The broth was really good and I loved the crispiness of the seitan The noodles were nice and chewy and there was a lot of vegetables I wish there was slightly more seitan but we all loved this dish nonetheless Curry Bowl 4/5 This was good but it was served lukewarm I wish there was more curry but the pumpkin croquette things were really interesting as they were chewy and had a nice mild flavour The potatoes were very undercooked though and the eggplant also could have been more tender The curry was quite chunky and it could have been more liquid in my opinion but overall it was still very enjoyable I definitely recommend this place It has the best vegan Vietnamese food in Vancouver and a great place to go for date night or if you are looking to splurge a little,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Dave S.,2021-10-21,1,Wait wasnt bad When I arrived with my wife they had seating for 2 inside and all the tables outside were open It wasnt that cold so we sat outside and the bartender was kind enough to start the heater for us We waited about 10 minutes to get our order in  just two bowls In the mean time after we had ordered another table of 3 came and sat down We were told 15 minutes later they are a little backed up so itll be a few more minutes 10 minutes later my wifes bowl arrived My wife finished her bowl and during this the table that arrived after us got 5 different plates of theirs before I got my one bowl I told the waitress this is odd but all I was told was they were backed up Food wasnt worth the hype but just okay,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Emy P.,2020-09-28,1,We were so excited to try this new spot in Van Everything was alright until we discovered a dark hair inside one of the tofu piece Daikon Cakes we had ordered 2 nights ago This is unacceptable especially with the current situation the world lives in Everything else was delicious and its too bad they cant control their food better,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Angela W.,2020-09-20,5,I have been wanting to try this for a while but Kingsway location is out of the way for me Im so glad they open in Yaletown Interior is very chic and clean gives a nice comfy vibe Food was great both taste and visual-wise and satisfying even though theres no meat we had 5 appetizers and 1 main shared among 3 of us small to medium tummies and it was just right I loved all of them except maybe the Black Truffle Tofu which doesnt have much of a truffle taste but has strong ginger taste which I hate but my parents liked it The Black Garlic Eggplant was excellent though the rice was a little too mushy for my taste the eggplant was egg-cellent though Pricing reasonable and service good Will definitely revisit soon to try rest of the menu,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Matt B.,2020-10-17,5,Very happy to see this place open a second location replacing House Special Everything about the original location is copied well here with the addition of a very pleasant patio out front overlooking this quiet part of Hamilton Menu is a bit smaller than the Kingsway location but they have all the staples here I ordered takeout for lunch here with a friend we ordered the black garlic eggplant and the vegan pho both exceptional and both 15 Very generous portions too for reasonable prices especially for Yaletown The order was ready in 20 minutes and everything was perfect Great to see this gem of a place expand,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian

C B.,2020-09-23,1,Good space cool decor but Cmon Seriously Gluten free vegan vegetarian Trendy empty vague premises that suck a tiny % of the community in for an empty food experience at a grossly inflated price Went there tonight with a friend so sad A dish titled Uncle Hings wings 5 mushrooms pieces deep fried tossed with the usual sad suspects so boring If your ridiculous sales and marketing pitch is vague vegan and boring why not have a protein name based dish  Lets have Turkey Tofu or a plant hot dog as well Looking at the menu basic 9 ingredients done 19 ways All our dishes lacked taste texture the Vegan pho was miserable maybe rename  Pathetic Pho   Or just say left over veggies thrown in a bowl Would never go back,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Angelina C.,2020-11-06,5,First time at this place and I was not disappointed We go the uncle hings wings satay noodles and black garlic eggplant The wings were definitely my favorite The soup has a good potential but it came out warm so I wasnt able to enjoy it to the fullest Overall the restaurant itself is very welcoming and the all of the staff is very polite Well definitely be back,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Amy C.,2020-09-20,5,I loved their first location and am so happy they opened a second The Yaletown location is spacious with great outdoor seating You got to get the salad rolls  THEY ARE AMAZING The Vegan verm is absolutely delicious I like the pho but found the entire avocado a bit too much I asked to sub the avocado for more bean curd instead,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Tommy D.,2021-05-12,2,Food is good but the service is incredibly slow Make sure youre not hungry when you go there because you will be extremely hangry Have dined in and ordered for pick up and both times waited over 30 minutes for the order,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian

Jonny M.,2019-12-05,3,I wanted BBH for lunch but the lineup was ridiculous at Cafe Xu Hue We ventured two doors down to Veggiebowl where there was plenty of room They specialize in Vietnamese vegetarian food We dropped in on a Sunday for a late lunch around 1:00pm Theres 8 tables 3 booths and room for about 32 people Service is standard the front is run by the kids At least our teas were refilled several times Menu is short and sweet with only 15 items appetizers rice  noodles and beverages They had a few desserts only available on the weekends on the counter and in the fridge che  Hu tieu nam vang B5 10.50  tapioca noodles broth fried vegan ham cube assorted tofu enoki mushrooms cauliflower and carrots Never seen this offered before so had to try it The tapioca glass noodles were enjoyable Broth was clean slightly peppery Fried vegan ham cube was a solid meat replacement Good variety of vegetables seems like they change it up depending on availability  Hu tieu satay B7 10.50  flat rice noodles peanut satay sauce shallots fried tofu beansprouts mushrooms cucumber lettuce tomatoes basil and roasted peanuts Didnt realize this was a dry noodle dish when we ordered it Sauce had some good heat to it but it was thin almost too watery Decent but nothing spectacular Decent vegetarian food but nothing Im craving,Veggiebowl
C.S J.,2020-08-15,5,If you dont need the trendy cachet of places like Do Chay Veggie Bowl is infinitely better with deeply flavourful broths good value timely accurate service and wide selection Have not been disappointed with anything Ive tried and only want to try everything,Veggiebowl
Gavin W.,2020-02-25,4,Unpretentious son of a gun this place is Dont expect to see hipsters or westsiders clad in yoga outfits here Do expect good food for those who are vegetarians or vegans as many of the dishes are available dairy-free and especially for those who like me generally eschew red meats but who from time to time need to sink their teeth into something with some modicum of protein-y texture When that urge strikes the go-to dish is the Lemongrass Tofu The deep-fried component can be somewhat dry even with the fish sauce See my picture Otherwise its pretty damn good My daughter likes the Vegetarian Curry with brown rice Very tasty and rich broth My son likes the Spring Rolls The skin has a solid crunch to it Its no small feat to create these flavors without dipping deeply or at all into the animal kingdom  Ive dined here maybe seven times Seating has not been a problem You can usually find parking on Kingsway if you get here at around 6:00pm Décor is functional See p,Veggiebowl
Annie M.,2018-04-18,4,Veggiebowl is located on Kingsway between Gladstone and Baldwin Street Its small and clean Vietnamese vegetarian restaurant I came here for dinner with my Buddhist good friend She has to go for vegan meal on 1st and 15th each month My friend recommended few good dishes to me Its quite impressed Bue Hue  Tofu bean curd enoki and king oyster mushrooms and lotus root Great and simple ingredients in lemongrass spiced broth SO delicious for spicy vegetarian noodle bowl Bi Cuon  Shredded tofu rolls its good and filling Goi Ngo Sen  Lotus salad so refresh Bang cuon and Ch La  rice roll and vegan ham I liked to dip it with fish sauce taste more flavorful Happy to go on vegan meal once a while easy on my stomach and good for my health,Veggiebowl
Suzan L.,2017-12-23,5,Can I just tell you how much Im in love with this place Best vegetarian Vietnamese Ive ever had in Van it beats Chau by leaps and bounds pricewise and flavorwise Veggiebowl is just an undiscovered gem by most and I guarantee if you find it you wont be able to stay away My favourite dish has to be their take on Bun Bo Hue Usually its made with beef and pig feet but Veggiebowls is loaded with juicy oyster mushrooms and fried tofu The broth is the perfect amount of spicy accompanied by a strong lemongrass aroma Just perfection I know Im literally waxing on and on about it like some kind of bad poet but it really is the shit Dont miss it Go there,Veggiebowl
Jeremy W.,2019-01-02,4,We didnt miss the meat For a couple of omnivores Veggiebowls offerings certainly satisfies our stomachs with uniquely delicious flavours and textures This is our second visit and wanted to try a dish off their specials menu posted nondescriptly under the register We chose the steamed rice wraps usually filled with minced pork and were surprised by the taste of the veggie substitute they used Topped with fried garlic and paired with a flavourful nuoc cham it tasted great Also ordered was the Satay Noodles Packed with flavour and a spicy kick the tofu substituted in for the uaual chicken was a winner Nice bite to the noodles as well Of course no Vietnamese meal is complete without spring rolls and these did not dispppoint at all Crispy not oily and filled with veggie delights If ever wanting a break from the meat give this place a try your meatless meal will be accompanied by wonderful service as well The staff is very nice and knowledgeable,Veggiebowl
de o.,2021-01-06,5,Hands down best vegan Vietnamese restaurant Super authentic very flavourful and affordable The pho is so tasty It is a must try,Veggiebowl
Jax M.,2020-01-11,5,Ive tried so many different Pho noodles in North America both regular beef and vegetarian Over all their vegetarian noodle soup is the best The soup is with full of flavour not too salty or too msg taste Veggies are nicely cut perfectly boiled They are not too busy/noisy so you can relax and enjoy a bowl of soup Their customer service is always excellent very polite servers are always smiling and nice Which is kind of rare in Vietnamese restaurants I guess its culture thing Inside of restaurant is well organized very clean even their washroom is well taken care of Oh and their tea is my favourite I dont know what kind of tea it is but very good,Veggiebowl
Stan L.,2016-08-13,5,Amazing vegetarian Vietnamese food without the pretentiousness of that OTHER veggie Vietnamese place Im almost afraid of giving this place 5 stars because consistently high ratings will eventually make this place too popular And over-popularity can be detrimental But the food here was amazing The Papaya Salad was crisp and vibrantly flavoured It was classified as an appetizer but for some people it could have served as a meal The Vermicelli Special was done as well as any traditional Vietnamese restaurant But the kicker was the tofu meat actually tasted as good as the real thing It tasted just like real BBQ pork sausage I dont know how they do it but it must be sorcery The deep-fried spring rolls were also so good that I didnt feel like I was being penalized for eating vegetarian Again portion size was generous The tofu salad rolls were okay Ill have to admit that I much prefer prawns or pork in my salad rolls But for what it was it was a nice change of pace Overall a terrific place to indulge in Vietnamese vegetarian food without having to fight for a seat with annoying hipsters at that OTHER crowded overrated Veggie place,Veggiebowl
Chere Michelle C.,2018-09-07,5,Oh My God Be still my heart this place is bloody delicious Service is a bit hit and miss to be honest...but the fresh flavors and generous portion make up for it The fresh tofu rolls with peanut sauce are a must try I ordered the satay for lunch and it was a medium heat which was perfect It was so tasty and fresh with tons of tofu My mom ordered the lemongrass tofu and while tasty it was on the very dry side Portions are generous Prices reasonable Atmosphere is quiet despite being on Kingsway Its a gem Im going back tomorrow,Veggiebowl
Bonnie C.,2016-05-12,5,I came here on a Monday evening with my two friends and we ended up ordering the Vermicelli Special B1 the Spicy Vegetarian Soup B4 the Vegetarian Curry with Vermicelli B6 and some sort of rice roll thing that is new and isnt on the menu didnt catch the name that the server had shown us a picture of on her phone All of the dishes were delicious and for those with a smaller appetite the portion sizes are enough for two meals My friends and I had to work hard to finish all of our food and by the end of it we were in a food coma Logistical details tea or water is provided free of charge We got to choose where we wanted to sit Chopsticks spoons and napkins were on the side for us to grab Inner decor was very nice and put together Clean Relaxed Didnt feel rushed at any point or anything Dont be fooled by the lack of reviews This place is amazing and you should definitely make your way over here when you get the chance Theres currently construction right next door so parking is a bit annoying but the food makes up for it,Veggiebowl
Kevin O.,2019-02-07,2,I came here after shopping and did not have a pleasant experience This visit occurred near the end of November 2018 We went inside and had to wait a minute or two to get greeted and sat down The owner was running all over the place because it was becoming packed He was unable to speak English fluently which made it problematic when communicating to the table next to ours They were asking which of their menu items were popular We had our menus maybe 5 minutes into being seated After ordering it took over 40-45 minutes for the food to come out Of course it was noticeably understaffed likely one cook in the kitchen and the one person getting the orders and payments During this time this woman ordering take out had walked in and out of the store at least 4 to 5 times waiting for her order so I could tell service was pretty backed up Its a small store so thats understandable The owner had to call back up to come in and in came 3 young children 2 teens 1 child in elementary sometime later The food itself was not that great I had ordered the Hu Tieu Nam Vang I am not vegan or vegetarian but I can appreciate different foods The flavour wasnt bad but the ingredients were cheap as well You dont really get full from eating a large bowls worth of noodles I will say that it is nice and light and does not leave you feeling bloated but it honestly just felt like something can be easily made with the cheapest ingredients For instance there was tofu but the amount was hardly anything ie 2 thin slices of fried tofu grated carrots While it says it is a veggie bowl the ratio of soup to vegetables and noodles was unbalanced The price for what I ordered was rather depressing I believe it was around 13+ and I left very hungry which is in part due to the absurd wait time Again its understandable given the amount of people and perhaps the circumstances but for this specific experience its a no-no Would I recommend this place I would actually if you like light meals and are a vegetarian I personally would not go back again because the price is just not worth what I received in my honest opinion The taste of other dishes might be better so dont let me stop you from going TLDR Long wait Taste was okay but not filling Price not worth it Go if you want to try Vietnamese-styled vegetarian cuisine,Veggiebowl
Stephanie T.,2018-05-17,5,Im not a vegetarian by any means but I left super stuffed and satisfied I have never had vegetarian pho and Im a phonatic Super good and filled with flavours I believe they boil ginger and fruits to give that flavourful taste I am def going to try to make this at home The spring rolls was pretty impressive and still gave that feel that you would have been eating the original spring roll with the meat Lotus salad was nice and refreshing Betel leaf was wicked and filling You gotta try it here,Veggiebowl
Gloria C.,2019-02-14,5,Vegetarian Vietnamese food vs non vegetarian foodie Certified I never knew vegetarian pho could be so flavourful I get B3 vegetarian pho The soup is amazing you can really taste the 5 spice powder in the soup the soup is light and not heavy at all Every time I eat this I always get full half way compared to when Im eating normal pho I am never able to finish my noodles how is this possible Me and my fiancé are so blown away by the vegan ham it tastes like the real thing I absolutely LOVE the smokiness it has,Veggiebowl
Annie P.,2018-07-19,4,I was suffering from a devastating hangover made so much worse by the fact that I am an insufferable baby when it comes to discomfort Since giving up meat Ive mourned the loss of of one of my favourite treats--pho My darling and long suffering partner was sick of hearing me lament my self-induced agony and in an attempt to shut me up lurked Yelp in search of vegetarian pho THEN like an angel sent down from heaven Veggiebowl appeared This vegetarian pho is SO DAMN GOOD My god is it ever good It cured me not only of my hangover but of many lost opportunities to indulge in soupy goodness I cant wait to go back and explore more of the menu I would encourage meat-eaters to not overlook Veggiebowl simply because its vegetarian This is veggies done right and you will not leave disappointed,Veggiebowl
Cytrus M.,2017-11-13,4,Great restaurant Loved the food even though Im not an avid vegetarian Very filling as well Its a small place so large groups more than 8 may be hard to fit but its good for everyone otherwise The location is good as well and very easy to get to even by transit The prices are average around 10 per person and like I mentioned very filling,Veggiebowl
Emily C.,2017-05-25,5,This is hands down the best vegetarian Vietnamese food in the hood Sure Chau Veggie Express nearby is pretty decent too  but if you want some really bold flavours extremely and consistently fresh ingredients Veggiebowl takes the cake The soup flavours are so rich e.g Pineapple to add sweet and sourness to their sweet and sour soup  thats genius more variety in veggies okra taro lotus stem celery snap peas cauliflower etc Ive had almost everything on their menu and nothing disappoints me not to mention its just way more relaxed in here despite being tucked right beside a huge construction site at the moment If you wanna talk ca$h moneh its also way cheaper than Chau Veggie Express great portioning youre getting noticeably fresh ingredients as well as avoiding the noisy and poor layout of Chau Veggie especially when they get busy If youre a fan of family-owned biz support these guys Also fresh-pressed orange and grapefruit juice made to order hell yeah 10/10 love this place,Veggiebowl
Super S.,2018-11-04,4,Came here with my significant other we shared a spicy soup and made it extra spicy that was pretty good The lettuce rolls were a good appetizer We got a plate of the Vermicelli Special we feel that there could have been more flavors added in it was a tad bit bland,Veggiebowl
Bryan W.,2017-02-02,5,This place is amazing Food is amazingly fresh and their dishes are unique We were simply looking for a vegetarian place to eat and veggie bowl came up so we decided to call to see if we can get a table for 6 when I called they said no seats but I said if Im coming now how long is the wait  they said got 6 Your coming now I said yes  then was told if Im not there in 15 mins the table would be given away I am so glad I called in advance  they had our table set up and ready for us when arrived They were pact after we sat down the line up just grew We saw why they are so popular the food was amazing fresh unique and tasty Servers were friendly our food didnt come out the fastest but still in a timely fashion for all of us I am definitely looking forward to trying their other dishes they have to offer Their rice bowl was really good  worth trying,Veggiebowl
Ruth H.,2021-11-18,5,We love Kokomo They have the best GF vegan food in Vancouver They are some friendly Just why arent they opened before 11,Kokomo
Amanda X.,2021-01-02,2,Kokomos açai bowls are delicious never seemed to have an issue until recently I found not one not two but several pieces of inedible plastic shards that could be mistaken as coconut shards Nice DEFINITELY NOT COCONUT SHARDS How the hell did those get in my açai bowl I couldve had a life and death choking experience Irresponsible,Kokomo
Chloe C.,2020-09-30,5,This place is great if youre in a rush and are looking for something healthy I had their beet macro before which was really good and the two new items I tried this time around were really good as well Hemp Caesar Salad 5/5 This joins Beetbox and Heirloom as my favourite caesar salads of all time The dressing is super tasty and the nooch adds a nice umami to it The greens are fresh and the marinated chickpeas are flavourful The sunflower crackers are good as well but not crunchy I added soy curls to the salad and they were really delicious as well Coastal Macro Bowl 4/5 This was pretty good The dressing was flavourful but I found it a little too salty and there was too little of it The tempeh was tasty and the edamame hummus refreshing The greens were fresh and the squash soft and sweet This also came with cucumbers and pickled cabbage Mac and Cheese 3/5 This was just okay It was a little boring and bland in terms of flavour though the sunflower cracker bits on top saved it a little There was only two tiny piece of broccoli in there and overall I wasnt that impressed with this feature It is a little on the pricey side considering the portions you get but Id say its worth it since the bowls are really colourful and nice to look at and you feel good after eating them,Kokomo
Joy K.,2020-08-20,3,I love Kokomos bowls and get them often But today I tried a smoothie of theirs and was very disappointed The smoothie came in a tiny cup compared all the competitors on west 4th which are 50% bigger then this and the roughly the same price It was more a juice then smoothie and very watery It was also served to me missing about an inch of smoothie from the top of the cup It was bad value for money Although the juice/smoothie was tasty itself I will just stick to the bowls from now on,Kokomo
Annie C.,2018-09-14,4,I was in the Kits neighbourhood grabbing a coffee with a friend at Their There Cafe and she recommended this place for lunch Im not on a vegan diet or anything like that but am always intrigued by new spots Both the interior and exterior are super cute and aesthetically pleasing I tried the vegan laksa 11 as per my friends recommendation In my opinion vegan/superfoods have the reputation for being expensive but I found the price to be very reasonable considering the location and the portion I quite enjoyed my laksa the coconut flavour was prominent and the pickled carrots added a nice contrast I have not had many vegan food experiences but this was definitely a positive one,Kokomo
Ella D.,2020-08-09,5,Picked up some takeout and ate down at the beach It was so good Very good first intro to tempeh Also got a coffee crisp shake The only negative was that the consistency of the shake was like water and it wasnt 100% but other than that all good,Kokomo
Dolan R.,2020-07-04,2,The banana bread is promoted as to die for  TDF and it is actually a joke Some of the worst banana bread i have ever had They are trying to rip off the name of an actually amazing banana bread Their bowls are mediocre as well If you want underwhelming and meh This is the place,Kokomo
Fi Y.,2019-03-03,5,I have been to Kokomo at kits for many occasions now and I love it every time From the cute decor to the staff and of course the food  everything is just superb Yes it is a little on the pricey side but I believe its totally worth it I dont mind spending my money on 100% wholesome goodness P.s Huge thanks to the staff  my klutzy hubby dropped his drink on our way back to the car He went back to re-order but the staff was kind enough to offer him a replacement for FREE  I will be soon Kokomo,Kokomo
Miriam T.,2020-02-23,5,Unbelievably good healthy and quick vegan food Have not tried one thing from Kokomo Ive disliked  they have a serious knack for flavour I also love that theyre on Doordash their partnership extends delivery all the way to North Van BTW and that they have a fun rotating menu Was sad to see my favourite summer salad rolled out and replaced by a quinoa one for the colder months but hey life is full of disappointments I take comfort in the fact that their magical Hemp Caesar seems like a fixed item Another note of support their lovely staff who have given me everything from tea advice for constipation to free candy on Halloween Good vibes Kokomo remains a staple in my week-to-week diet,Kokomo
Shila B.,2018-08-31,5,Atmosphere As you would expect given the concept that this is very clean and inviting You feel fresh Price Standard for most concept places and market value Customer service Very friendly with respectable time frame service Food Its different variations of salads that comply with most dietary needs including a cleanse that I was on for a few days therefore came with a friend of mine during our date nights I had the flower power salad with the dressing on the side,Kokomo
Amelia H.,2019-11-16,3,Loved loved the Caesar salad 5/5 Really disliked the breakfast bowl neither of us could eat it beyond a few bites and we tossed it out 1/5 I also did not like the vibes of sitting in the restaurant with all of the messy open shelves and the stain covered cushions on benches,Kokomo
Buddy Z.,2020-02-20,5,Very refreshing and flavourful food First time here was a pleasant surprise since I dont frequent the area Had the golden laska noodles and me time tea Certainly will be thinking of this place again when Im in the area thank you Kokomo staff The ginger pickled carrots where really nice It was almost uncomfortably warm inside is my only down point Hopefully that will be fixed in the future Weather was a full sunshine day and 5 degrees,Kokomo
Amy T.,2019-05-11,5,Ive been wanting to try this place based on their Instagram posts and finally had the opportunity to It didnt disappoint Its smaller but more adorable than I expected I split the Beet Poke and Kokomo açaí The staff are super sweet and split the meal for us The tastes are amazing and leave you with zero guilt,Kokomo
Marie I.,2018-06-28,5,GO JUST GO THERE AND ENJOY Such a nice find All the food is vegan gluten free tasty and the ingredients have integrity The staff is very friendly and helpful And the food came up right away I wanted something warm so I had the Golden Lakshmi Absolutely delicious and easy on my stomach Xoxo,Kokomo
Jennifer C.,2018-08-01,5,Ive been to both locations and will be back regularly Still need to try the Coco Whip which is apparently only at the Kits location as of my visit Highly recommend the snack plate with hummus I forget the real name Nood Beach and Curry Laksa We tried the Hemp Kale Caesar as well which was really good flavor-wise but you must love chickpeas Or mix in sparingly,Kokomo
Philly G.,2019-01-07,4,So initially I went on the website to check out their menu when a friend mentioned it months ago As I scrolled down a womans butt appeared out of nowhere Pictures of food butt food again I dont get this In the era of MeToo why do advertisers feel that this is necessary to sell food Unless it was art idk So anyways jump ahead several months and same friend says we should go here for lunch I am vegetarian and she always makes an effort to patronize veggie places when we go out to eat I did not at all link the place with the website I had visited before this I had one of the Macro bowls It was amazing A burst of flavours that medley together in ways I havent experienced before They use tempeh and other foods not commonly seen in these parts I am not really a hummous fan anymore just from overabusing hummous in my early vegetarian days but their hummous is the only hummous I will eat these days Tangy and bsolutely delicious I have been back 3 times since that first visit introducing all my veggie friends to it Ive had both Macro bowls and havent tried anything else yet but I will make my way through the menu Oh and they are also very accommodating I am doing the low carb thing and they will happily sub out the rice for greens with no extra charges I very much appreciate this And they are always friendly Even when I discovered that this is the place with the butt I still go back Go figure so much for my principles But I did leave off 1 star for the butt,Kokomo
Ozz N.,2019-05-12,5,Love this place Recently moved to the neighborhood from Venice beach  this place reminds me of a mini cafe gratitude The macro bowls are amazing,Kokomo
Lara B.,2018-09-14,5,From beginning to end this place rocks We absolutely LOVED the laksa and yesterday I also had a yummy smoothie Katie the owner is adorable and made us feel right at home...we will be back,Kokomo
skylar b.,2018-08-30,4,Came all the way to try the cocowhip that the other location no longer carried Got the espresso one and it was BOMB Only complaint is that for the price it was on the smaller side so was a little bummed it wasnt a bigger portion Pricy but worth it Next time wont share with the boyfriend Please open location in LA,Kokomo
Niuniu Z.,2018-08-24,4,Friendly service  fun menu My laksa bowl was super flavourful and addictive...Quite fresh and light despite the coconut creaminess A bit too much air conditioning  fanning in this weather though,Kokomo
Chloe C.,2021-06-20,5,Ive tried all four burger patties including the brunch burger here and I must say that they are all equally good If youre a meat eater then youd probably like the faux real the best its approved by my brother but they also have lots of tasty veggie patties that dont sacrifice on flavour or texture Their new brussel sprouts dish is really good although they needed to be cooked more since they tasted a tad raw in the middle The sauce lends the brussel sprouts a lot of flavour and complements the dish surprisingly well It is quite an oily dish though which some people may be concerned about The yam fries are always great especially with the chipotle aioli The shakes and salads are okay not really my favourite,Planetary Burger
Aida K.,2021-11-08,4,Definitely one of the BEST locally made veggie  vegan burger patties in town Was my FIRST time ordering at this place  I use a 3rd delivery app Ordered their Junior BBQ Bacum  Shroom burgers plus 2 fries Super delicious patties  would recommend to event meat lovers Patties were flavourful juicy and thick Fries in the bag were surprisingly small in portion I requested a substitution of a bread bun with iceberg lettuce instead  they complied 1 extra Minimal packaging is appreciated It perfectly hit the spot without the feeling of heavy weight sitting in my stomach Would come here again,Planetary Burger
Jill N.,2021-01-22,5,Hands down the best vegan burger Ive had I got the shrooms burger with cheese and yam fries My friend got the harvest burger made with favs beans and pea protein and regular fries It was all exceptional they even had home made ketchup Will definitely be back to try the cauli burger made with cauliflower and chickpeas,Planetary Burger
Simin W.,2021-02-25,5,Discovered my new favourite plant-based burger in Vancouver I went for Dineout Vancouver in 2020 and absolutely LOVED it The Shrooms Burger tasted just as juicy and flavourful couldnt believe it is made with mushrooms So delicious Their fries were also the perfect crispness and I devoured it all Also if youre lactose intolerant like me you can enjoy their amazing DAIRY-FREE SHAKES without worrying Highly recommend the strawberry shake and the chocolate shake is delicious too Whether youve never tried plant-based food before or looking for more vegan friendly diners go check this place out,Planetary Burger
Nicole B.,2021-06-15,2,"First time ordering from this shop through Uber eats It was so,so the fries were good The poutine tasty The milkshake was also tasty but their actual vegan burger patties leave much to be desired First of all the faux burger patty had a bitter aftertaste and tastes like the chaff of vegetables after theyve been juiced The compostable parts I read they are loaded with protein so I endeavoured to finish it but couldnt as it had a very earthy strong flavour without spices Not my jam Id rather eat meat TERRIBLE!!!Ill stick to beyond meat burgers",Planetary Burger
Matt B.,2020-12-04,4,So great to have an all-vegan burger joint in my neck of the woods 4 burgers to choose from 3 different fries options and 4 different salads to choose from all quite customizable depending on your tastes I ordered the shroom dip burger 9 which comes with a delicious mushroom gravy dip The burger patty is pretty tasty seeming almost more like a hearty homemade patty rather than your typical junk food burger which I really appreciate Its rather pricey for the portion but all in all it was very tasty and I was happy I also added on a side kale caesar 6 which was well-done and a side order of fries 3 which you can order baked  a great touch For a big eater like me the meal is on the pricey side  and they offer no combo orders Despite this minor complaint I was really happy with this place and I hope they do really well,Planetary Burger
Sofie P.,2021-01-25,4,This is a pretty decent vegan Burger and Fries place I enjoyed the burger a lot though I wouldnt say it was really convincing as faux meat the same way that Beyond might be Tasted more like a bean-patty which it was Fries were good gravy was gooD Had to add the cheese at home which was weird since I know they have vegan cheese that they add to the burger but they wouldnt make a poutine Mylkshake was just okay nothing special Very expensive for the sizing Worst thing is the price Theres no combo option so the burger and fries were separate 9 Burger + 1 for vegan cheese 4 for the fries and 1 for the gravy,Planetary Burger
Elvi R.,2020-07-29,4,This was my second time going to Planetary Burger.Their menu has changed since the first time that ive been there This time i ordered the Faux Real with cheese fries and a chocolate milkshake This is a great place is youre craving a burger and fries The burger was messy but i didnt mind it Fries were cooked to perfection The milkshake I would probably not order again it didnt really taste like chocolate in my opinion I will be going back to try the Shroom Dip,Planetary Burger
Chef D.,2020-09-17,2,Pretty unimpressed over all though the burger was good same with he chocolate shake the customer service on the phone was pretty bad When we ordered the brunch burger we were told it wasnt part of the dine outside menu when it was then we asked to pick it up around 2 and were told we could only pick it up right now because they had other customers waiting I have worked at restaurants and that is not how a phone order should go As well both me and my girlfriend both had stomach issues an hour or two after eating here which is unfortunate,Planetary Burger
Issabelle F.,2020-04-17,5,Plant based comfort food hello A friend and I came to Planetary a few months ago right when they opened and loved it Im a bit picky when it comes to veggie burgers but I loved the one I got from Planetary I got the beet burger and my friend go the cheezeburger and we went halfsies so that we could try both We also split an order of the poutine topped w onion gravy and almond cheese because duh I was very impressed with the meat-like texture and flavour of both burgers The patties werent mushy or soggy like other veggie burgers Ive tried and the cheese in the cheezeburger tasted like real cheese The fries in my poutine were perfectly crispy and I was pleasantly surprised with how much flavour the onion gravy had The set up is fast casual You order at the counter grab a seat and they bring your food to you The staff working the day i visited were super friendly and recommended the beet burger which was a great call on her part Theyre temporarily closed at the moment due to Covid but I cant wait to come back for another beet burger when they re-open,Planetary Burger
Emily S.,2019-10-20,4,Plant based fast food served with a smile Everything made in house Honestly so shocked at the meaty texture of the Cheezeburger patty and the cheeze I think they should sell that sliced cheeze I would loooooove a pack of vegan sliced cheeze singles It has the same melt and pull as kraft singles without the horrors of dairy Im shook HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE CHEEZE BURGER Cant wait to try the mushroom burger and the mylk shakes Only reason its a 4 and not 5 star because of the French fries The ones I recieved the rosemary fries with vegan parm were flavourless and soft Couldnt find the parm on them and only the slightest rosemary aftertaste at the end of the meal,Planetary Burger
Natalie W.,2020-11-30,4,Decided to try this out for takeout and was pleasantly surprised I had their cauli spice burger and the air baked yam fries I added a slice of cheeze to my burger Overall it was a tasty burger Very flavourful and the cheeze is one of the better vegan cheeses Ive had The yam fries came with chipotle mayo and it was tasty Definitely would have been better fresh but still good regardless My brother had their regular fries and they held up pretty well They were crisp and salty My brother liked his faux real burger He thought the burger was a bit small and wasnt anything too special But was still a decent burger He liked the harvest burger better because there was a bit of texture added with the quinoa Overall if Im craving a burger and wanted a meat alternative Id probably order from them again,Planetary Burger
Derek G.,2020-03-05,5,Wow We are jonesing to go back My partner and I went 100% vegan in December 2019 after being pescatarians for years Lots of our at-home meals have been vegan for years but we still ate eggs and dairy until last December Its been really fun discovering places that are 100% vegan  where you dont have to even think about what you can and cant eat what can or cant be substituted etc Some places are more appealing than others We tried Planetary Burger for the first time last weekend and we were blown away The food is delicious the staff are really friendly and helpful and its in a cool space One of the other reviewers commented that the burgers are a bit on the small side This is true They are delicious and obviously made with high-quality ingredient but definitely a bit small Usually a burger and fries will fill us both up In this case we ended up ordering a bit more food We each had the beet burger amazing and the poutine with almond cheese crazy-delicious but we were still a bit hungry The poutine was large and we shared it but we ended up getting a third burger having it cut in half and ordering a small poutine We also had a coffee milkshake And THEN we were full The milkshake was out of this world Theyve managed to make a shake that behaves like a dairy shake right down to how it melts with the centre still firm and the part around it melting Really delicious flavour with great depth Were going back this weekend and from here on out itll be one of our regular haunts for sure If I could change one thing I would suggest that the burgers be bigger but otherwise everything else is 100% fantastic Flavour quality friendliness cleanliness and great atmosphere To be clear the burgers arent tiny  just a bit on the smaller-than-usual side Thanks guys Derek PS I love that they use Violife cheese This is one of the rare good vegan cheeses that doesnt have that funky taste and it melts really well Ive since gone out on bought some to have at home,Planetary Burger
Mark B.,2020-07-24,5,This place makes it easy to forget youre eating plant-based burgers Ive tried all the burger options and you really cant go wrong although the spiced cauliflower option is divine And the fries and shakes can stand up against any burger shack anywhere Do NOT forget to order a salad either So much yummy going on here,Planetary Burger
Jess S.,2020-01-14,3,Located mid Main St area this tiny burger place offers vegan fast food/dinner-like food The place is small You walk in to find 2 tables and a counter I ordered the burger tasting flight and choose Beet Beet lentil  quinoa patty with cumin smoked paprika  nutritional yeast Spicy cauliflower Spicy cauliflower chickpea with cayenne parsley  nutritional yeast and Mushroom Mushroom  roasted garlic patty with oregano  caramelized onions and a side of poutine Topped with roasted onion gravy  squeaky almond cheese I liked the Beet burger the best It was crunchy and you could taste all the different components The Spicy Cauliflower was fine but I would have never guessed it was cauliflower I didnt care for the Mushroom It was a bit soggy and not particularly flavourful The poutine is also ok The gravy was a bit too salty and the crinkle fries was a weird touch for me Service was good I was there only customer but they were very friendly They also serve your meal on an old school silver lunch tray which was cute,Planetary Burger
Sarah M.,2020-11-29,5,Okay yes the burgers are good  but the milkshakes UNREAL They taste like what I remember McDonalds to be and not in a weird way Im obsessed Like I actually want to buy their milkshake machine and take it home with me along with the ingredients and make my own milkshake nightly Highly recommend Sooooo good,Planetary Burger
Gary O.,2020-07-15,5,Walked by and decided to try this place out It is a plant based restaurant with four different kinds of plant based burgers that all looks like they are made in house They also have items such as fries vegan gravy and salads To drink the have soda and shakes I tried the cauliflower curry burger and it was really good Will come back again to try out the food items since it all looks so good Staff were all nice and friendly as well,Planetary Burger
Scott L.,2020-12-13,2,So Im not sure what you want when you eat a burger but when I do Id like a little flavour..we had the mushroom patty and the beyond style burger and they were bland not even a little salt the fries were okay tuff to judge when you get take out cause they are usually soggy by the time your home and theirs were i wouldnt eat here again Id rather eat a beyond burger at home,Planetary Burger
Gary M.,2020-01-06,5,A great plant based burger joint Tried the Mushroom burger  Rosemary fries with their special sauce Surprised me it was very very good Another tried the spicy cauliflower burger  poutine The spicy cauliflower burger is very mild and Im sure even the timid will like it The staff was friendly and efficient They even answered questions about ingredients Theres even a gluten free bun for the burgers,Planetary Burger
Mike S.,2020-09-11,5,Im not a huge fan of veggie burgers and often feel like Im missing out when my wife recommends them Not so with Planetary Their food is delicious and the milkshakes are insane,Planetary Burger

Sofie P.,2021-01-25,4,This is a pretty decent vegan Burger and Fries place I enjoyed the burger a lot though I wouldnt say it was really convincing as faux meat the same way that Beyond might be Tasted more like a bean-patty which it was Fries were good gravy was gooD Had to add the cheese at home which was weird since I know they have vegan cheese that they add to the burger but they wouldnt make a poutine Mylkshake was just okay nothing special Very expensive for the sizing Worst thing is the price Theres no combo option so the burger and fries were separate 9 Burger + 1 for vegan cheese 4 for the fries and 1 for the gravy,Planetary Burger
Elvi R.,2020-07-29,4,This was my second time going to Planetary Burger.Their menu has changed since the first time that ive been there This time i ordered the Faux Real with cheese fries and a chocolate milkshake This is a great place is youre craving a burger and fries The burger was messy but i didnt mind it Fries were cooked to perfection The milkshake I would probably not order again it didnt really taste like chocolate in my opinion I will be going back to try the Shroom Dip,Planetary Burger
Chef D.,2020-09-17,2,Pretty unimpressed over all though the burger was good same with he chocolate shake the customer service on the phone was pretty bad When we ordered the brunch burger we were told it wasnt part of the dine outside menu when it was then we asked to pick it up around 2 and were told we could only pick it up right now because they had other customers waiting I have worked at restaurants and that is not how a phone order should go As well both me and my girlfriend both had stomach issues an hour or two after eating here which is unfortunate,Planetary Burger
Issabelle F.,2020-04-17,5,Plant based comfort food hello A friend and I came to Planetary a few months ago right when they opened and loved it Im a bit picky when it comes to veggie burgers but I loved the one I got from Planetary I got the beet burger and my friend go the cheezeburger and we went halfsies so that we could try both We also split an order of the poutine topped w onion gravy and almond cheese because duh I was very impressed with the meat-like texture and flavour of both burgers The patties werent mushy or soggy like other veggie burgers Ive tried and the cheese in the cheezeburger tasted like real cheese The fries in my poutine were perfectly crispy and I was pleasantly surprised with how much flavour the onion gravy had The set up is fast casual You order at the counter grab a seat and they bring your food to you The staff working the day i visited were super friendly and recommended the beet burger which was a great call on her part Theyre temporarily closed at the moment due to Covid but I cant wait to come back for another beet burger when they re-open,Planetary Burger
Emily S.,2019-10-20,4,Plant based fast food served with a smile Everything made in house Honestly so shocked at the meaty texture of the Cheezeburger patty and the cheeze I think they should sell that sliced cheeze I would loooooove a pack of vegan sliced cheeze singles It has the same melt and pull as kraft singles without the horrors of dairy Im shook HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE CHEEZE BURGER Cant wait to try the mushroom burger and the mylk shakes Only reason its a 4 and not 5 star because of the French fries The ones I recieved the rosemary fries with vegan parm were flavourless and soft Couldnt find the parm on them and only the slightest rosemary aftertaste at the end of the meal,Planetary Burger
Natalie W.,2020-11-30,4,Decided to try this out for takeout and was pleasantly surprised I had their cauli spice burger and the air baked yam fries I added a slice of cheeze to my burger Overall it was a tasty burger Very flavourful and the cheeze is one of the better vegan cheeses Ive had The yam fries came with chipotle mayo and it was tasty Definitely would have been better fresh but still good regardless My brother had their regular fries and they held up pretty well They were crisp and salty My brother liked his faux real burger He thought the burger was a bit small and wasnt anything too special But was still a decent burger He liked the harvest burger better because there was a bit of texture added with the quinoa Overall if Im craving a burger and wanted a meat alternative Id probably order from them again,Planetary Burger
Derek G.,2020-03-05,5,Wow We are jonesing to go back My partner and I went 100% vegan in December 2019 after being pescatarians for years Lots of our at-home meals have been vegan for years but we still ate eggs and dairy until last December Its been really fun discovering places that are 100% vegan  where you dont have to even think about what you can and cant eat what can or cant be substituted etc Some places are more appealing than others We tried Planetary Burger for the first time last weekend and we were blown away The food is delicious the staff are really friendly and helpful and its in a cool space One of the other reviewers commented that the burgers are a bit on the small side This is true They are delicious and obviously made with high-quality ingredient but definitely a bit small Usually a burger and fries will fill us both up In this case we ended up ordering a bit more food We each had the beet burger amazing and the poutine with almond cheese crazy-delicious but we were still a bit hungry The poutine was large and we shared it but we ended up getting a third burger having it cut in half and ordering a small poutine We also had a coffee milkshake And THEN we were full The milkshake was out of this world Theyve managed to make a shake that behaves like a dairy shake right down to how it melts with the centre still firm and the part around it melting Really delicious flavour with great depth Were going back this weekend and from here on out itll be one of our regular haunts for sure If I could change one thing I would suggest that the burgers be bigger but otherwise everything else is 100% fantastic Flavour quality friendliness cleanliness and great atmosphere To be clear the burgers arent tiny  just a bit on the smaller-than-usual side Thanks guys Derek PS I love that they use Violife cheese This is one of the rare good vegan cheeses that doesnt have that funky taste and it melts really well Ive since gone out on bought some to have at home,Planetary Burger
Mark B.,2020-07-24,5,This place makes it easy to forget youre eating plant-based burgers Ive tried all the burger options and you really cant go wrong although the spiced cauliflower option is divine And the fries and shakes can stand up against any burger shack anywhere Do NOT forget to order a salad either So much yummy going on here,Planetary Burger
Jess S.,2020-01-14,3,Located mid Main St area this tiny burger place offers vegan fast food/dinner-like food The place is small You walk in to find 2 tables and a counter I ordered the burger tasting flight and choose Beet Beet lentil  quinoa patty with cumin smoked paprika  nutritional yeast Spicy cauliflower Spicy cauliflower chickpea with cayenne parsley  nutritional yeast and Mushroom Mushroom  roasted garlic patty with oregano  caramelized onions and a side of poutine Topped with roasted onion gravy  squeaky almond cheese I liked the Beet burger the best It was crunchy and you could taste all the different components The Spicy Cauliflower was fine but I would have never guessed it was cauliflower I didnt care for the Mushroom It was a bit soggy and not particularly flavourful The poutine is also ok The gravy was a bit too salty and the crinkle fries was a weird touch for me Service was good I was there only customer but they were very friendly They also serve your meal on an old school silver lunch tray which was cute,Planetary Burger
Sarah M.,2020-11-29,5,Okay yes the burgers are good  but the milkshakes UNREAL They taste like what I remember McDonalds to be and not in a weird way Im obsessed Like I actually want to buy their milkshake machine and take it home with me along with the ingredients and make my own milkshake nightly Highly recommend Sooooo good,Planetary Burger
Gary O.,2020-07-15,5,Walked by and decided to try this place out It is a plant based restaurant with four different kinds of plant based burgers that all looks like they are made in house They also have items such as fries vegan gravy and salads To drink the have soda and shakes I tried the cauliflower curry burger and it was really good Will come back again to try out the food items since it all looks so good Staff were all nice and friendly as well,Planetary Burger
Scott L.,2020-12-13,2,So Im not sure what you want when you eat a burger but when I do Id like a little flavour..we had the mushroom patty and the beyond style burger and they were bland not even a little salt the fries were okay tuff to judge when you get take out cause they are usually soggy by the time your home and theirs were i wouldnt eat here again Id rather eat a beyond burger at home,Planetary Burger
Gary M.,2020-01-06,5,A great plant based burger joint Tried the Mushroom burger  Rosemary fries with their special sauce Surprised me it was very very good Another tried the spicy cauliflower burger  poutine The spicy cauliflower burger is very mild and Im sure even the timid will like it The staff was friendly and efficient They even answered questions about ingredients Theres even a gluten free bun for the burgers,Planetary Burger
Mike S.,2020-09-11,5,Im not a huge fan of veggie burgers and often feel like Im missing out when my wife recommends them Not so with Planetary Their food is delicious and the milkshakes are insane,Planetary Burger
Annika G.,2021-10-10,5,4.5/5 so good while we visited vancouver this was our favorite spot woweeee the spring rolls were so good even my BF who isnt really a fan of vegetarian food usually was caught off guard by how delicious everything was the service was smooth and friendly the ambience of the restaurant was really nice  the decorations and the overall restaurant was beautiful we got there at a good time around 11:30AM not long after it opened and luckily we did so as it got so busy as were finishing up so make sure to come early while there we tried the charcoal lemonade spring rolls papaya salad and lettuce wraps we only tried from the appetizers as we werent too interested in the entrees but man were we satisfied and full from the 3 appetizers each was was delicious and did not feel heavy i felt super healthy after eating all of it the charcoal lemonade was very interesting it did not stain our teeth and tasted like an earthy lemonade that was not too sour moreover it tasted even fresher with mint leaves that i borrowed from our appetizers i usually dont like eating out but this spot i would love to return to,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Emma W.,2021-09-07,5,Wow I am so happy my friend recommended this new spot during my recent visit home to Vancouver Do Chay Yaletown is a beautiful and hip spot equipped with hanging plants serving up healthy and clean Vietnamese dishes and cocktails We stopped by at 11:30am on a Friday and were the first people there we made a reservation just in case They have great seating options inside and out My friend and I shared the mango salad black truffle tofu and eggplant dish Everything was delicious but the tofu was definitely our fave It was perfectly crisp and the sauce it came with was perfectly light and flavored without being overwhelming We also got black lemonades which was a wonderful accompaniment to the meal I will definitely be back,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Elvi R.,2021-05-27,5,Decided to go to Do Chay in Yaletown for Mothers Day dinner Everything we ordered was delicious We started with the spring rolls and the wings I can probably have 10 orders of the wings Theyre so good super crispy and I love the sweet and spicy sauce that theyre coated in Before becoming vegan lemongrass beef was a go to for me so I was super excited to try their lemongrass tofu Loved the crispy shallots on top Was very flavourful I would order it again It was a very generous portion We also ordered the Bún Bò Huế but got it with rice noodles instead of the spaghetti looking noodles It was very flavourful and very spicy in my opinion The waitress said it wasnt but it definitely warmed me up The kind is spicy you want to keep eating I went back last weekend and was so happy again Definitely recommend this place if you like Vietnamese food Bon Appétit,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Siimmy G.,2021-11-13,5,Amazing Vegan/Vegetarian cuisine in YT We tried four different vegan dishes and the flavour was amazing The vegan chicken wings made from mushrooms were definitely my fav and apparently the most popular The menu does change quite a bit I was told so Ill def be back,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Jacqueline W.,2021-08-06,5,So amazing I cant back the very next day Theres a reason why this place won best new restaurant 2020 You wing miss meat eating here Everything is so flavourful The spring rolls are crispy yet not oily The fish sauce it comes with makes the dish come together so well Also tried the black garlic braised eggplant Absolutely delicious I love eggplant now 10/10 on all dishes,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Be F.,2021-07-20,5,We stumbled on this place while trying to find Meet and ended up having a way better meal We had the Prosperity Dumplings  complex tender and flavourful in a lovely broth the pho  very authentic with the surprising win of avocado slices and tofu skin and Uncle Hings Wings breaded oyster mushrooms with a sweet sauce Fabu Wed order all three again but want to come back and try everything else first starting with the lemongrass tofu and the vegan Vern,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Cy W.,2020-11-19,5,Delicious food that is kind to the environment We have been a fan of the restaurants Kingsway location so we are excited that it opened a second location right in the heart of Yaletown which is in need of a place offering delicious and inventive vegetarian food We were looking for a light meal and decided to go Do Chay for some healthy dinner For appetizer we were curious about the Uncle Hings Wings which are deep fried breaded mushrooms in a sticky sweet and sour sauce It definitely taste very similar to chicken wings We also got the Spring Rolls which comes with mustard green cut into perfect wrapping shape and herb basil/sage For entrees we shared the Black Garlic Eggplant served with yo choy and rice We cant wait to go back and try out all the other creative vegetarian dishes they have on the menu,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Charly S.,2021-02-04,5,Spring rolls served with greens for wrapping and Black Garlic Eggplant/Tofu  these are two of my all-time favourite foods The spring rolls are crispy outside and chewy inside  wrap in the accompanying greens and dip  soooo delicious just like Vietnam The Black Garlic Eggplant and tofu is a savoury sweet smokey dish served with perfectly cooked fluffy rice and a few greens is Vietnamese comfort food perfect for cold wet Vancouver nights The mango salad is delicious but I prefer these types of salads a little crunchier/less soft The Pho is the best vegan pho Ive had  rich yet smooth and clean filling and colourful This Yaletown location is bright and cheery nice patio out front If youre looking for plant based Vietnamese look no further Enjoy,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Chloe C.,2020-10-02,5,This is my dads new favourite vegan spot The food was so delicious but the portions were definitely small for the price The decor is really amazing though Uncle Hings Wings 5/5 This was the best deep fried mushroom dish Ive ever had We all couldnt stop raving about it The batter is crispy and not greasy and the mushrooms had a great texture The flavour was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy Black Garlic Eggplant 5/5 This was so flavourful The eggplant and tofu was cooked perfectly and the sauce was amazing The textures and flavours were on point Satay Noodles 5/5 The broth was really good and I loved the crispiness of the seitan The noodles were nice and chewy and there was a lot of vegetables I wish there was slightly more seitan but we all loved this dish nonetheless Curry Bowl 4/5 This was good but it was served lukewarm I wish there was more curry but the pumpkin croquette things were really interesting as they were chewy and had a nice mild flavour The potatoes were very undercooked though and the eggplant also could have been more tender The curry was quite chunky and it could have been more liquid in my opinion but overall it was still very enjoyable I definitely recommend this place It has the best vegan Vietnamese food in Vancouver and a great place to go for date night or if you are looking to splurge a little,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Dave S.,2021-10-21,1,Wait wasnt bad When I arrived with my wife they had seating for 2 inside and all the tables outside were open It wasnt that cold so we sat outside and the bartender was kind enough to start the heater for us We waited about 10 minutes to get our order in  just two bowls In the mean time after we had ordered another table of 3 came and sat down We were told 15 minutes later they are a little backed up so itll be a few more minutes 10 minutes later my wifes bowl arrived My wife finished her bowl and during this the table that arrived after us got 5 different plates of theirs before I got my one bowl I told the waitress this is odd but all I was told was they were backed up Food wasnt worth the hype but just okay,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Emy P.,2020-09-28,1,We were so excited to try this new spot in Van Everything was alright until we discovered a dark hair inside one of the tofu piece Daikon Cakes we had ordered 2 nights ago This is unacceptable especially with the current situation the world lives in Everything else was delicious and its too bad they cant control their food better,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Angela W.,2020-09-20,5,I have been wanting to try this for a while but Kingsway location is out of the way for me Im so glad they open in Yaletown Interior is very chic and clean gives a nice comfy vibe Food was great both taste and visual-wise and satisfying even though theres no meat we had 5 appetizers and 1 main shared among 3 of us small to medium tummies and it was just right I loved all of them except maybe the Black Truffle Tofu which doesnt have much of a truffle taste but has strong ginger taste which I hate but my parents liked it The Black Garlic Eggplant was excellent though the rice was a little too mushy for my taste the eggplant was egg-cellent though Pricing reasonable and service good Will definitely revisit soon to try rest of the menu,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Matt B.,2020-10-17,5,Very happy to see this place open a second location replacing House Special Everything about the original location is copied well here with the addition of a very pleasant patio out front overlooking this quiet part of Hamilton Menu is a bit smaller than the Kingsway location but they have all the staples here I ordered takeout for lunch here with a friend we ordered the black garlic eggplant and the vegan pho both exceptional and both 15 Very generous portions too for reasonable prices especially for Yaletown The order was ready in 20 minutes and everything was perfect Great to see this gem of a place expand,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian

C B.,2020-09-23,1,Good space cool decor but Cmon Seriously Gluten free vegan vegetarian Trendy empty vague premises that suck a tiny % of the community in for an empty food experience at a grossly inflated price Went there tonight with a friend so sad A dish titled Uncle Hings wings 5 mushrooms pieces deep fried tossed with the usual sad suspects so boring If your ridiculous sales and marketing pitch is vague vegan and boring why not have a protein name based dish  Lets have Turkey Tofu or a plant hot dog as well Looking at the menu basic 9 ingredients done 19 ways All our dishes lacked taste texture the Vegan pho was miserable maybe rename  Pathetic Pho   Or just say left over veggies thrown in a bowl Would never go back,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Angelina C.,2020-11-06,5,First time at this place and I was not disappointed We go the uncle hings wings satay noodles and black garlic eggplant The wings were definitely my favorite The soup has a good potential but it came out warm so I wasnt able to enjoy it to the fullest Overall the restaurant itself is very welcoming and the all of the staff is very polite Well definitely be back,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Amy C.,2020-09-20,5,I loved their first location and am so happy they opened a second The Yaletown location is spacious with great outdoor seating You got to get the salad rolls  THEY ARE AMAZING The Vegan verm is absolutely delicious I like the pho but found the entire avocado a bit too much I asked to sub the avocado for more bean curd instead,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian
Tommy D.,2021-05-12,2,Food is good but the service is incredibly slow Make sure youre not hungry when you go there because you will be extremely hangry Have dined in and ordered for pick up and both times waited over 30 minutes for the order,Do Chay Saigon Vegetarian

Angus M.,2021-11-22,4,I didnt realize that this was a no waste restaurant While the food was actually really good something about leaving a 4.00 deposit for a glass take out container leaves a bad taste The funny thing is I had my shake in a glass mason jar and only paid 1.00 for that I wonder why not give that as an option I wish they said something before I ordered But other than that it wasnt too bad They have a good selection of vegan and non dairy items and their shakes were quite good without leaving me stupidly full,Kind Cafe
Le Roi E.,2021-09-23,1,Anti vaccine establishment Youd think a vegan place thats supposedly about being healthy would support public health guidelines Will never be a customer here,Kind Cafe
EastVan F.,2021-08-26,1,Anti-mask/vaxx establishment not to mention suuuuper overpriced for what they offer Id recommend staying away unless you feel like catching the rona,Kind Cafe
Issabelle F.,2020-05-08,5,Kind is the cafe of my dreams Im in love with their two-level airy aesthetically pleasing space Pre-covid Ive dined in numerous times and during Covid Ive ordered take out once Through all my experiences the staff have been so friendly Kind Cafe hires kind people The staff were especially appreciative when I came in to pick up my take out order Their menu is 100% plant-based which is awesome Ive brought my meat-loving friends here and even they love their menu I think Ive tried almost their whole menu at this point but my favourites are their carrot lox bagel tastes like real lox smashed avo bagel nutty spice smoothie bowl balanced greens smoothie bowl power up bowl and the buffalo tofu sandwich What I love about their food is that it fills you up without making you feel gross and bloated Since its located in the bustling South Main St area parking can be a bit of a pain on the major streets However Ive been lucky sometimes finding parking in the back roads and then walking over But your best bet would be to take transit down I cant wait to enjoy another carrot lox bagel people-watching on their mezzanine with a delicious beetroot latte in hand SupportLocal,Kind Cafe
Chloe C.,2021-05-07,5,Best flatbreads and some of the best sandwiches in Vancouver However their baked goods seem to be getting worse for some reason I use to love their scones but this time they were incredible dry The chocolate zucchini muffin was also not good the sugar granules on top were unnecessary and the banana in the muffin was not advertised Their new caprese sandwich is really good though Their pesto is amazing as well as their foccacia bread and cheeze I added tempeh and it was 10/10 Their breakfast sandwich with tempeh tofu mayo and cheeze might be my favourite though Sadly I was not a fan of their yam fries or their mac and cheese I did really enjoy their falafel wrap though The tortilla they use is fantastic and their falafel is not dry which is quite rare to find at least in my experience,Kind Cafe
Elena A.,2020-04-19,5,If youre craving for Vegan food look no further Kind cafe offers a huge variety of vegan food coffees and desserts I love their Carrot Lox Bagel its my favorite Their bowls are great as well My favorite is Mediterranean Bowl with Falafel so good I never leave Kind Cafe without getting Blue Lavender latte It has blue-green algae maca cinnamon mct oil lavender SO DELICIOUS Golden Sunshine that contains turmeric lucuma house spice blend tahini is my second fave here I recommend this place to all my friends I really love the ambiance and food there,Kind Cafe
Max L.,2021-04-22,2,Got two bowls for myself and my 4yo Kind one tasted okay Mediterranean had very sad dry falafels in it and tasted old neither of us could eat it We both had an upset stomach after and now we have to bring the 4 deposit containers back Not impressed,Kind Cafe
Michelle H.,2020-02-01,5,SO GOOD AND ALL VEGAN Wowowow after having this i dont ever crave pizza from Dominos anymore sorry Dominos I got the Buffalo Cauliflower Flatbread and it was delicious so flavourful and just amazing  The serving size was also perfect and I enjoyed it so much that although I was stuffed I felt sad after it was all gone  I was also very impressed with the variety of their menu as they are an all vegan cafe/eatery They are also zero waste which I LOVE So PSA remember to bring your own containers if youre someone who always has leftovers as they do not provide take out containers This would be a great place to work or catch up with friends as there is an upstairs balcony with plenty of couches as well as work spaces I wished I had discovered this place earlier as Im no longer in Vancouver anymore so go check it out and lmk what you guys think ,Kind Cafe
Bella C.,2020-01-03,4,LOVE all that the cafe stands for Zero waste and vegan  Love that Im not vegan myself but I do love how environmentally cautious this cafe is Loved the ambiance and setting here Perfect place for me to enjoy a quick snack and get some studying done I ordered the avo toast and it was delicious You cant go wrong with avocado and tomatoes and bagels It is a little pricier as it avocado toast is easier to make however they use fresh ingredients The Blue Coconut Dream Smoothie Bowl was so fun to look at Interesting how there was zucchini in the smoothie You cant really taste the zucchini or blue algae as the banana and coconut overpowers the veggies The granola is housemade and I do love how nutritious the smoothie bowl was I would love to try the other smoothie bowls I would recommend this place as a good study place with great healthy options,Kind Cafe
Lauren L.,2020-06-24,4,I like these types of places for good honest clean food I was surprised I had ended up parking right in front It was a sign So I changed our girl date to eat here instead Clean spacious and dining with other vegans or healthy inspired people always feels good It felt like a positive experience and helps to keep me motivated in life Ok Im not vegan but I do like clean food and from time to time I crave it Its about timing And today timing was perfect I had the beet latte unsweetened and perfect The food was very good too Happy that they can do dine in in todays COVID world,Kind Cafe
Julia H.,2019-10-27,4,Super cute cafe in the Main Street area where can get some work done Plenty of seating at the bar and the community tables you cant have laptops at the actual table This restaurant is as environmentally friendly as it can be  Theres no one use items theres no napkins but reusable towel which is really neat I think they also dont have to go cutlery so you would have to bring your own if you want to take out Ive tried the Cesar kale salad which I really enjoyed very fancy and flavourful and I added to falafel once which isnt fried which was a surprise It was also pretty good Second time I came here I got the cauliflower flat bread Its not bad not my favourite there was too much sauce for my liking Portion sizes here are fair This is definitely a nice spot to check out in the neighbourhood ,Kind Cafe
Isabella M.,2020-09-13,2,FYI none of the staff or chefs wear masks and there are no protective barriers The food was good and I like that theyre promoting zero waste plans based cuisine Ill wait until after the pandemic to feel safe eating there,Kind Cafe

Maya O.,2019-12-22,4,Staff is Kind so kudos for being on brand  As for the food  theyve got some good menu items but a few questionable ones as well Green goddess salad is good Bagels are a safe bet I liked the smokiness of the carrot lox The avocado bagel was good as well though not exceptionally exciting However still enjoyable I can appreciate food with some simplicity I would steer clear from the Tempeh Reuben Ordered it and and no one at the table wanted more than one bite Initially its edible but the combination of flavours just tastes off Hated that I had to be wasteful at a no waste cafe but I couldnt stomach it Id like to reiterate the good service when I mentioned the situation to the staff they replaced it with the avocado bagel which I enjoyed at no extra cost Theyve got kombucha on tap Always a plus Ive tried the green and blue smoothie and both were yummy Not a huge fan of the black sesame latte as it was a bit heavy and not the tastiest But maybe itd be good paired with a baked good Ive been here a few times and enjoyed my overall experience every time so I would definitely recommend trying them out I also realize taste is subjective so maybe youll vibe with the stuff I didnt Thank you Kind for what youre doing A good addition to Vancouvers Vegan scene I look forward to future growth and fine tuning you got this,Kind Cafe
Tom S.,2019-09-23,5,Tasty salads knowledgeable staff regarding gluten allergies These are not the typical salads the variety of ingredients and flavors is remarkable We just happened upon the restaurant and wow what a treat The ambience was light and fun emphasizing kindness They even have a huge neon peace sign upstairs We had lattes that were flavored but not sweetened awesome with hazelnut I had the Kind Salad and my wife had the Super Salad Both were delicious and healthy,Kind Cafe
Makenzie D.,2020-04-09,5,This place is everything you could ever want in a vegan cafe  modern great food great drinks kind staff I am very lucky to live in proximity to this place If youre looking for a great place to study the atmosphere inside this cafe is very relaxing  however there are quite a few tables where electronics are discouraged Very zen My favourite food here is the flat bread There are several different kinds such as BBQ Tempeh and Buffalo Cauliflower Great qualify with an amazing taste you hardly remember its vegan My favourite drink is the Blue Lavender Latte A vibrant blue drink with a soft and subtle floral flavour and it never leaves my stomach hurting because it is made with no dairy obvi Did I mention they made their own in house hazelnut milk This place is ZERO WASTE Which is something that needs to be highlighted This is revolutionary and completely doable for ALL cafes Take note from this cafe they are doing everything right,Kind Cafe
Vivian D.,2020-10-08,5,it is hard to find a restaurant/cafe place in Vancouver that has delicious food great prices and beautiful/cozy ambiance inside...the kind cafe on Main St is that what a find i loved how eco friendly they are vegan low/zero waste clean and an all around delight to be a patron of highly recommend their commitment to healthy food helping the environment and being a friendly neighborhood joint is phenomenal ,Kind Cafe

Jennie Y.,2021-08-11,4,We had a lovely dinner here last week The chatpata sev puri crispy wheat papdi stuffed with chaat topped with spicy potato sev was amazing and packed with flavour The butter chicken and lamb curries were also great Their garlic naan was fried perfectly extra crispy on the outside but still fluffy on the inside We sat inside and felt like we were transported to a tropical island with the open air windows high ceilings and eclectic decor,Sula
Jurn L.,2021-06-30,5,I absolutely love Indian food but unfortunately I dont get to eat it as much as I want to because fiancé isnt much of a fan So I was super happy to check out Sula with a girlfriend as it came highly recommended by our mutual girlfriend Between the two of us we shared the Butter Chicken and Gobi Aloo along with Garlic Naan for me and Tandoori Naan for her Everything was super delicious We chose a Medium spicy level for the Butter Chicken and it had the perfect kick to it The Naans came out warm and fresh The Gobi Aloo tasted great as well We had enough leftovers for dinner Overall it was a yummy lunch Also received great service Highly recommend,Sula
Lyndsay P.,2021-05-15,5,Truth be told Ive eaten out far more than my reviews point to...Covid is exhausting and it hasnt been top of mind BUT this place I only popped in for a happy hour snack and drink I will return for the full menu that looks amazing The snacks were so yummy but the best part about this place was the warm and welcoming atmosphere The servers were so incredibly kind I havent had service like it for as long as I can remember Just felt like I was visiting someones home Comfortable with hosts that were attentive and just so genuine Will return for a full meal and will update then too ,Sula
Aerica W.,2021-04-22,5,Love the interior here and even their cutlery cups/glasses were beautiful Staff were super friendly and accommodating Nice and cozy place for drinks and conversations 1 oz for 7 and 2 oz for 10 Came here for their Happy Hour menu drinks I came here on a Saturday Sat  Sun Happy Hour 2-5pm weekday hours vary I believe roughly 3pm or 4pm to 6pm Our order Indian Summer tequila pomegranate pink salt lime Unique and tasty drink as I dont see pomegranate drinks often or ever anywhere else Western Ghats vodka cherry lemonade sparkling water  Im personally not a fan of cherry but my friend said it was delicious and refreshing with the added bubbles from the sparkling water Nagpur orange grapefruit soda lime  I really enjoyed this one it has a neat citrus-y blend with a kick Tandoori Wings 9 super flavourful and juicy wings with a tasty charred flavourful Highly recommend this  Beautifully presented drinks that pack a punch Might as well 2 oz everything Also tried their chaat savoury snacks on a separate visit which are popular and typically served at road-side stalls or food cars in India My order Samosa Chaat the samosas were HUGE and very very filling so I would recommend sharing if youd like to try other dishes Spiced potatoes onions and peas are stuffed in a savoury pastry Its also loaded with a lot of toppings house-made chutneys sauces Indian yogurt and my personal favourite which were these crunchy mini-sticks on top sorry I dont know the name of it Sev Puri wheat balls w various fillings Hollow crunchy wheat balls which already taste great by themselves and are filled with a bunch of stuff as well including chickpeas onions cilantro pomegranate etc Highly addictive bited-sized and vegan Vada Pav fried potato dumpling in bread The bun is amazing its toasted on butter and has a great chewy texture The fried potato dumpling tastes like a mini samosa to me Also very filling Overall everything was very flavourful This restaurant definitely pays attention to details  their food flavours decor service everything,Sula
Marci H.,2021-11-13,5,Very warm and inviting room excellent service and amazing quality food The cocktails are creative and delicious the prices are reasonable Will definitely be back again and again,Sula
Krista R.,2021-11-06,5,The service and quality of dining at Sula is fantastic I love all their dishes but what makes them unique is their Indian street food the Railway is a family favourite dont miss out,Sula
Matt B.,2020-12-16,5,Really happy to see a second Sula location this one even closer to home And for them to open during the pandemic they must be doing really well We ordered takeout one evening and went to pick up the food when ready 45 mins later Menu is nearly identical to the original location with an exclusive vegan section of items I am happy to report theyve replicated the original location in terms of the awesomeness of the food We ordered the veg jalfrezi gobi aloo and the bhindi okra all medium-hot which was perfect spice level might be a bit much for some  as well as a couple tandoori rotis ask for no butter to ensure its vegan Total 53 after tax which is a little spendy for Indian food but totally worth it for the high-quality of the food  and we had enough for one for meal the next day Wonderfully complex flavours not too oily rich without being overwhelming and generous portions And their dishes have loads of veggies and arent too saucey or thin like many Indian places Overall Sula remains our favourite Indian restaurant in Vancouver Top recommendation,Sula
Jeannie Y.,2021-08-31,4,Flavours in Sula is better than the previous restaurant I had samosa chat and cheese and garlic naan The samosa was just lightly warm I was hoping for fresh piping hot and crispy I also hoped it be spicier However I did enjoy the varied texture profiles between the chick peasfrom the sauce and the topping of thin red onion slices  Also enjoyed the sweetish/sour/salty flavour notes all in one dish The garlic and cheese naan was yummy I bought butter chicken to take home I asked for spucy level just a bit above medium Although flavorful I received mild to medium spiciness Id ssy the ambiance and staff were courteous I would go back again,Sula
Michael L.,2021-02-20,5,Came here during Dine Out Vancouver during COVID I reviewed their web page prior to booking and it was nice to see the COVID protocols they had in place including temperature checks on patrons When we arrived they did not do the temperature checks on us nor on any of the other patrons that followed They have installed large plexiglass screens between tables for COVID protection and all the staff wore masks I was satisfied with the COVID compliance so now onto the review The room is beautifully re-done from the old Reef restaurant that used to occupy the space for the past 21 yrs We ordered off the Dine Out Vancouver menu 30 per person knowing that this would be a lot of food we were not disappointed We ordered the spinach potato onion pakora and the chicken tenders as appetizers Both were great tasting and both were large portions For the main I ordered the chicken tikka masala hot spice level coconut rice and the naan The dishes came out in beautiful dishes and again the taste of each were great The naan was sooo good and they did not hold anything back on the hot spice level I barely got into the main before I was full...again nice large portion size For dessert we sampled the mango coconut rice pudding and the almond pistachio rasmalai cheesecake These were nice refreshing desserts after such a large meal They provided us take out containers and we left with meals for 2 persons The service was exceptional I liked that they brought a large pitcher of water and left it on the table for patrons to fill their glasses We had a chance to meet the owner and he explained how he selected this location trying to find an area with no Indian establishments in close proximity Sula is a welcome addition to the Main St  Mt Pleasant restaurant scene It was a very positive food experience and I am happy to recommend Sula if looking for Indian food in the area,Sula
Eileen R.,2021-10-04,5,Delicious A great place to satisfy your taste buds Im going back Butter chicken with garlic naan and a dish from the chaat menu Im going back to try more,Sula
Regina P.,2021-11-09,2,The food was presented very nicely but not as tasty as expected The service was quick but when I tried to add a seat to our reservation and requested for inside dining they told me they were completely booked up So we were stuck in a little corner on the patio while there were plenty of seats inside that would have accommodated 1 more person I think for this reason wont be back,Sula
Chloe C.,2020-12-21,4,Somewhat expensive but decent portions Food tasted fresh Channa Saag 4.5/5 Asked for mild but was more like mild-medium Very flavourful with lots of chickpeas I enjoyed this Bhagare Bhaigan 4/5 Asked for mild but this one wasnt spicy at all unlike the Channa Saag which is strange Sauce is tomato based and was nice although I wasnt a fan of the grated coconut on top Baby eggplants were nice and tender but I still prefer regular eggplant Eggplant Bharta is my favourite and Bhagare Bhaigan doesnt come close has nothing to do with the restaurant,Sula
Danny K.,2021-08-23,4,What an excellent new addition to the Vancouver ethnic restaurant scene A mixture of delicious Indian curries and street food In particular the dhai puri was amazing as was the saag paneer In addition excellent service thanks Mithu food handling and atmosphere Only minor thing if any is the food lacked a bit of depth of flavor that you often find at classic Indian restaurants May be the result of catering to a more North American pallet Overall amazing and well definitely be visiting again and taking our friends,Sula
Aditya G.,2021-10-30,2,Our server was great The ambience is very good But thats it  it was all downhill from there The girl at the front was really not in the mood to be there and behaved as if she was tired and pissed The food is the main disappointment  this is not Indian cuisine This is what these people think is Indian cuisine and their interpretation is way way way off the mark I cant even call this whitewashed food because it was just tasteless garbage with good plating,Sula
Yuka T.,2021-07-13,5,I visited this restaurant because I wanted to try Indian curry It was very delicious The naan had a nice garlic flavor that matched the curry very well I had a chicken curry milder it was good because it had a rich flavor Also the waitresses were cheerful and made the meal enjoyable,Sula
Jerome D.,2021-10-28,5,This was a fantastic dining experience  it starts with extremely friendly staff  great atmosphere and a lovely fire in the stove keeping the restaurant warm on a cold  wet day  our server was also excellent  suggesting food to try  and all was very tasty satisfying and beautifully presented will definitely recommend and return,Sula
Nye M.,2021-10-28,2,Ordered the portobello mushroom appetizer Asked specifically that it not be spicy It was spicy The server then began to explain why they dont ask for spice levels with appetizers as they come as they are Would have preferred she tell me that as I ordered it not when she checked in with us after we took a few bites Their Instagram page makes the food look amazing Its doesnt quite look like that in person Frankly overpriced for what it is,Sula
Jack D.,2021-08-01,5,Incredible laid back service with delicious and authentic dishes Great patio good music and lots of unique cocktails Must try Dahi Puri,Sula
Chris P.,2021-07-27,4,Drove into Vancouver heading to an Asian restaurant it was marked Open but when we arrived it was closed due to Family Day We were so hungry we checked out what else was close by Sula had great reviews so headed there We were greeted by a pleasant waitress name Katika  hope I got the spelling correct I asked for her recommendations and they were absolutely delicious The food matched the service My only suggestion for the restaurant is to serve filtered water as the water had a lot of chlorine,Sula
Sangeetha M.,2020-02-27,5,I think this may be my new favourite place for drinks I made a reservation and came by around 5:30 on a weekday hoping they have happy hour The crowd was mostly people grabbing a drink after work Its an interesting place seats more than it looks like it could and was not busy A reservation isnt required during the week Great service very attentive and amazing selection of drinks I like the whole theme atmosphere and little details that preserves bits and pieces of what this area previously used to home theatre and stock exchange I got a few bites to share too and I enjoyed the food I really like the pate but a friend of mine didnt The meatballs were a hit and gnocchi was alright I tried a couple whiskey based drinks and they were strong yet tasty Their bartender sure knows how to make drinks Only downside is theres no happy hour and the drinks are in the pricey side,Open Outcry & Pop Salt
Tracey O.,2020-10-12,3,3.5 stars I went with my gfs during covid  super quiet on a friday night Their special was buy a drink and get a FREE pasta dish It was such a great deal I was expecting the pasta to be small and meh but it was actually pretty good The other tapas were good too but nothing amazing Service as great too Only con was there was a very loud obnoxious table near us that kept screaming throughout the dinner  otherwise Id probably pop by again,Open Outcry & Pop Salt
Julia W.,2019-12-15,5,long review again but what did you expect frm julia this is first of my christmas/holiday gatherings with frds ofc started off with my foodies a and s this place is the cutest bar/pub/drinking place ever there are stairs involved once you enter the place but its downstairs when you go in and then up when you leave so...hey i managed so everyone else should be able to too  since this is a drinking place the food menu is limited BUT the food was good also armand sp was our server for most of the night until he had to leave and then megan sp was helping us at the end of it he explained the menu provided suggestions and was very attentive whenever we needed him idk if i am proud to say that ive tried all the gts on the menu  except the classic cuz...yeah i am the gin queen amongst my frds so  no surprise there out of the 4 i liked all of them tho the sundowner is on the sweeter side  so watch out cuz i downed that WAY too quickly i think i like the harmony and burlesque ones the most burlesque is the one of the cocktails that they make on the carts  you can see a little cart picture beside the drink on the menu that signifies itll be made there s got her usual extra dirty vodka martini with olives a pretty much shared the gts with me lol but the last drink that she got  the spy who loved me  was everything megan said it was basically alcohol in a cup it was great but that might be why julia super tipsy at the end there now now dont wry  we did eat we ordered the meatcheese bread and armand was super nice to add the corned beef that they make in the kitchen onto it OMG THE CORNED BEEF IS SO GOOD the other highlight of the board was the mustard  we had to order another side of it it was that good we also ordered the pâté bruschetta  i love how you get everything in one bite because they already spread the fig jam onto the bread also the number in front of the appies is how many servings/pieces youll get  just fyi we also heeded to armands suggestion of the meatballs which had a bit of a kick to it but they were oh-so-moist def going back even tho ive tried all the gts alr ,Open Outcry & Pop Salt
Sara M.,2019-11-14,4,This place is a lovely addition to the downtown core I really enjoyed the speakeasy vibe in here but would echo that the lighting could be taken down a few notches to really make that sing The service was fantastic Our server was incredibly knowledgeable about the entire menu and really took the time to walk us through the selections and make suggestions Our cocktails were delicious and appropriately boozy and having one made on the bar cart was a fun touch It did seem a little tricky to move and ensure the eye line wasnt obstructed especially once some overly enthusiastic guests started a stand up party but whatever its fun We shared the vegan bruschetta and the green goddess I wish we would have just ordered the bruschetta over and over again because IT IS SO GOOD The Nelson the Seagull bread really ties the whole room together The lighting could very well be a safety issue I mean boozy cocktails + all those stairs + sexy lighting could potentially = falls,Open Outcry & Pop Salt
Gayan P.,2019-12-04,4,New bar great old-school cocktail bar atmosphere with expensive drinks Certainly worth a try if youre into well-crafter cocktails Not the place to go if youre watching your budget,Open Outcry & Pop Salt
Nick C.,2019-11-13,4,This is one of Vancouvers newer drinking rooms Its small but ample room reminds me of a New York City underground speakeasy The menu consists of small and sharable plates We had the gnocchi and the meatball skewers both delicious I had a couple of non alcoholic cocktails both of which were delicious unique and refreshing I will return just for those alone The staff were both friendly and knowledgeable on their drink selections The table side cocktail carts are a nice touch but a bit clunky I could see them being an obstacle when its busy My only complaint would be with the lighting It was too bright for such an intimate setting When I walked in from street level and went down the stairwell I was really expecting it to be a bit more darker and warmer tying into the theme of the stock market from yesteryear Growing pains though It will all come together,Open Outcry & Pop Salt
Olga S.,2019-12-17,4,A classy yet cost place with staff that goes out of their way to be friendly make you feel welcome and special Theres a number of cocktails made table-side which provides for extra entertainment The food menu is on a smaller side although some snacks are mouthwateringly delicious Wish they add more vegetables like blistered shishitos or broccolini Cocktails are pretty exciting,Open Outcry & Pop Salt
Alexis L.,2020-03-21,5,Great place great food great service if you are in the mood for a good plate of cheese this is the place,Open Outcry & Pop Salt
Goat M.,2019-10-11,5,This is my new favourite place The food is great the cocktails are fantastic We had a meat and cheese board to start and the duck confit We will be back,Open Outcry & Pop Salt
Nadja G.,2019-10-20,5,Awesome place fantastic food amazing service and incredible drinks Very unique decor and ambience due to the historic setting A new must visit in Vancouver,Open Outcry & Pop Salt
Arun B.,2019-11-17,4,First visit here Newly opened restaurant The service was good but someone would come every 3 to 5mins to check on us a bit excessive Decor was nice Food was good but menu seemed very small They had a good amount of vegetarian options Extensive cocktail list but they will cost you anywhere from 14 to 20 Lighting is horrible hard to take pictures I would go back,Open Outcry & Pop Salt
Patricia L.,2017-10-27,5,Finally got the opportunity to visit Loving Hut Express a food truck by Yaletown-Roundhouse that specializes in vegan burgers and fries Ive been meaning to check them out for a while but since we dont live in the area and they are only open Thursdays to Saturdays I hadnt been able to make it out until today I went with my husband and we ordered the Crispy Chickn Burger and the Sunshine Teriyaki Burger respectively They use Gardein brand patties for their burgers which are delicious and we both really enjoyed our food Its really great seeing various vegan food trucks around the city and Loving Hut has a great location in Yaletown close to False Creek  The lady working there was really friendly giving us a run down of the menu and also directing us to good places in the area to sit and enjoy our food That was definitely above and beyond the kind of service Ive received from food trucks in the past Looking forward to coming back and trying some of their other burger options next time,Loving Hut Express
N H.,2019-01-10,4,Crispy chicken burger  All day long I usually order two I sincerely wish this place was a building and not a truck and that they were open more,Loving Hut Express
Anna C.,2016-09-07,5,Cash only compassionate vegan food truck Yaletown folks you guys are so lucky to have this right outside your high rise Loving Hut offers a decent selection of vegan burgers and sandwiches I got their mushroom cheese burger and the flavor was bomb Didnt get a chance to try their other stuff but the Teriyaki Pineapple Burger looks delicious too Side order fries came to me piping hot Everything was made fresh to the order and the folks were real friendly too,Loving Hut Express
Simon S.,2016-05-22,3,SLOOOW service on the Saturday I was there Looked like newbies in the food cart which made for a long lineup and a long time to get our one burger Grilled Mushroom Cheese Burger in Gluten Free Bun 9 +$1 for gluten-free bun My friends order so I didnt get to try this but she said the vegan patty was crunchy Hmm Gummy daiya cheddar cheese also kinda gross looking Dont look just eat Cheese Fries 5 or 4 with burger Portion is OK Cheese is some sort of pulpy mix that didnt have the same gummy texture of the Daiya that was in the mushroom burger Tasty for being salty Pretty decent for 14 and the fries can help make it a filling meal Even without the fries the size of the burger is pretty decent for 9 I wouldnt spend half my lunch hour waiting in line and waiting for my order though TIP Look for their truck that pulls the food cart Its probably nearby at metered parking which they have to feed periodically I just think its a curious indication of the cost of doing business,Loving Hut Express
Sara M.,2013-08-14,4,Oh yep yep yep Dirty delicious vegan food The peeps that run this truck are so nice Sure the food takes a while but be cool and wait Crispy Chickn burger avec yam fries Holy hell it was good Its way better than your memories of a McChicken kids Way better The Bacon Cheezeburger was pretty good too But for reals get the Chickn Get fat who cares,Loving Hut Express
Linda L.,2018-01-05,1,They do not update their schedule and worst of all do not follow their schedule Clearly stated on google that they were open  they werent No one answers the phone  terrible business practices Wasted an entire trip to Yaletown for no reason Theres better vegan options in Vancouver  avoid this unpredictable one,Loving Hut Express
Johnny J.,2018-01-05,1,I thought I was going to love this place I love supporting vegan businesses but I was mistaken They DO NOT adhere to their schedule If you live far from Yale town and want to take a gamble based on if they feel like opening on the day youre going then its your risk to take Honestly dont waste your time on a business that doesnt care about its customers,Loving Hut Express
Sophie C.,2018-05-25,5,Delicious Today Ive tried for the first time the teriyaki burger was super tasty and I will def go back for more of that,Loving Hut Express
Jane R.,2015-06-01,5,I got the crispy chickn burger and it was amazing Definitely worth a try if you are in the neighbourhood I love how its vegetarian yet you forget you arent eating chicken It was tender and crispy at the same time Worth the wait,Loving Hut Express
Nicole B.,2017-11-23,5,The BEST vegan burgers in town I love love love this little food truck Two elderly lovely ladies run this joint and everything is vegan and made with love  Hard to catch when theyre hours are and be patient its only two ladies and usually a line up but well worth the wait Cash only,Loving Hut Express
Emily B.,2017-05-20,5,Amazingly delicious We got the crispy chicken burger and the grilled mushroom burger and neither of us could stop talking about how delicious they were the entire time Crispy chicken was moist and delicious grilled mushroom burger patty actually tasted like chargrilled meat how and the toppings on both were absolutely scrumptious Worth the trip to Yaletown,Loving Hut Express
Trilia N.,2016-05-06,4,Waaa I want to cry Had gluten free burger and yam fries and it was soooo good Total price was 13 Very fulfilling Cant believe it was vegan wouldnt need meat if I could cook like this Very good gluten free bun too The dipping sauce with the yam fries was delish too,Loving Hut Express
Chase R.,2014-07-28,5,When it comes to vegan food Im a sucker for anything that has fake chicken in it This place was perfect for that as it had a vegan chicken burger The price was a little expensive for me 10 for a burger but it was worth it Ive had the brand of chicken they use in the past but never battered and fried and omg let me just tell you how amazing that tastes Im from Montreal and we have nothing like this I just hope someday we do because I am totally going to come back to this location when I visit again,Loving Hut Express
Ernest J.,2014-11-06,4,Isnt the point of a vegan or vegetarian restaurant to make their food taste like meat The more the food tastes like meat the better the restaurant is I dropped by my local Loving Hut with my friend He was telling me about their mushroom burger and some yam fries Ok the food was pretty good The yam fries were crispy crunchy and the chipotle dipping sauce are a perfect match The hamburger was surprisingly good It was moist and tasty Ill have to come back to try their other offerings,Loving Hut Express
Tram V.,2016-01-14,4,Augh I usually poke fun at my friends who are vegan  mostly about their limited food choices and if todays menu of twigs and leaves will be altered in any way So when my friend asked if I wanted to have a vegan burger from Loving Hut of course I said big fat nope But being the indecisive person that I am and not being able to find anything else to eat for lunch I promptly joined her to this bright yellow food truck Guys I cant believe Im saying this but its the BEST burger Ive had Even better than the juicy meat burgers I like to shovel into my mouth Fantastically seasoned and just grade-A delicious,Loving Hut Express
Shonah M.,2014-10-05,5,This is 1 of my favourite food trucks I go here simply for the crispy chicken burger Plus they sell the root beer I most enjoy as well  Virgils 2 summers ago a friend introduced me to Lovin Hut and since then summers have always been delightful He said to me  You do know that its a vegetarian burger  right  as I chomped away  mighty happy Could not believe it  tasted so flavourful and zesty Have often jumped on the CanadaLine to get to Yaletown just to get a bite  well worth the trip Burger is pricey but worth it Check out the Vancouver StreetFood App for times and location of this truck,Loving Hut Express
Jay B.,2018-03-29,5,The staple here are the chickpea fries They are so crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside I mainly get the platter which marries a generous serving of hummus salad pita and pickled veggies alongside your main entree of choice This is actually the first place that I have enjoyed tempeh They slow simmer it in curry and onions The result pure bliss I actually feel healthy after dining here Its hard to say that with most dineouts,Loving Hut Express
Nicole F.,2012-09-16,5,This is the best food truck that has ever existed My pal Bruce and I made plans to have lunch here on Friday After seeing the daily menu on their facebook page I knew I was going to have the Bacon Cheeseburger I was going to annihilate it With my face Bruce ordered the BBQ Onion Ring Cheeseburger and we sat down and waited IT WAS SO TASTY The bacon was smokey crispy and salty The beef patty was perfect and not at all dry or bland There was even some kind of vegan mayo on it as well as some typical burger condiments AND CHEESE SAUCE Made of daiya I think It was saucey messy hot and delicious I got it all over my lap and I regret NOTHING I didnt feel all gross and sluggish after I ate it either I felt great Ill probably be back like every day,Loving Hut Express
Felisa G.,2015-05-22,5,I ordered the yam fries and there chicken burger and it was delicious and tasted almost real,Loving Hut Express
Suman L.,2017-03-13,4,I tried the gluten free spicy burger and it was fabulous The bun tastes great and the service was pleasant Its so nice to have more gluten free options esp via food trucks I will definitely be back,Loving Hut Express
Lindsey D.,2021-10-24,5,I like vegetables This restaurant makes you love vegetables Ive visited 6 times in 3 weeks Ive even made trips to eat by myself to try the rest of the menu It is a complete meal that energises you Post meal One is full but has energy Its amazing Some of my favourites are Monkey Mushroom and Pea Tips the sauce and execution is divine Jai 6 different types of wheat gluten in different dressings Beancurd Skin Roll in Black Bean Sauce texture seasoning amazing Sweet and Sour Pineapple Delight Spicy Green Beans Veggie Pork Slices  when in doubt Monday-Thursday post 5pm Dinner Combos Staff are super nice and speak English Cantonese and Mandarin Street Parking can be tough,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Jia N.,2021-05-24,5,This is my absolutely favourite vegetarian restaurant It has such a great variety of vegetarian food and the quality and portion of the food is just amazing and so worth it The service is really friendly Takeout is 10% off and they also accommodate takeout in reusable containers bonus for my wallet and the earth Even when I order take-out in person they prepare the take-out so quickly Mine and my familys favourite dish is the Monkey Head Mushroom and Oyster Mushroom on Pea Tips So Good My brother says it reminds him of abalone and always asks for this dish whenever we order takeout from Sun Bo Kong Other dishes we have tried are Beancurd Skin Roll with Black Bean Sauce Sweet and Sour Pineapple Delight and Deep-Fried Emoji Mushroom on Soft Tofu with Broccoli All of which were really good Super happy that such a vegetarian restaurant exists here Definitely my go-to for amazing food,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Sofie P.,2021-05-21,5,Another amazing meal I had a small dinner with my bubble and we got Spring Rolls a fave all around Spicy Udon delicious Singapore Noodles a surprise fave of mine Fried Tofu my personal least fave as the tofu was either soft or medium and I was hoping for something firmer but everyone else enjoyed Overall a definite go-to place for great vegan  vegetarian Chinese food,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Tracy T.,2021-10-30,4,We normally come for dinner but I just found out they do dim sum too not sure if its just for weekend though Food here has great taste and quality Some of them are really outstanding like gluten combinations my favorite The service is generally good though I was a bit annoyed during my last trip The lady who served our table keep recommending items to my husband when we already ordered a good amount of food My husband was starving and had no self-control so we ended up double ordering and had sooo much left over to go ,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Karen S.,2020-09-03,5,Delicious vegetarian food in Vancouver BC Located on Kingsway Huge menu with lots of choices including rice dishes noodle dishes and hot pot Service was spot on Dinner for four adults including dessert was 75 We will definitely be back,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Chloe C.,2020-01-26,4,Service wasnt the best but that was to be expected Its very busy and crowded from when we came at 11 to when we left at 1 the place was constantly packed Lots of menu items to choose from but items take a while to arrive There is a tea and water fee of 1.10 per person Spring rolls 4/5 Pretty good but could use more filling and were rather oily The exterior was crispy and flaky which was nice BBQ puff pastry 1/5 We didnt finish this The puff pastry was greasy and the filling tasted weird and way too sweet Skip this for sure Deep fried turnip cake 4.5/5 Easily one of the best dishes that we got My only complaint is that it was too oily as the flavour was good Deep fried chilli tofu 3.5/5 Not too oily but a little lacking in flavour and it wasnt spicy at all The tofu was still nice and soft inside which was good Siu mai 0/5 We all hated this It was slimy and mushy and my grandpa even felt sick from eating it Spicy green beans 4/5 These were pretty decent They were flavourful and not that spicy Pan fried vegetable buns 1.5/5 The bun was okay but there was basically no filling and I find that unacceptable XO radish cake 4.5/5 These were very good but were too oily and the batter that they used to deep fry this was a bit too thick Pan fried veggie dumplings 3/5 Average The skin was way too thick Plain rice rolls 3/5 Also average Tapioca pudding 4.5/5 The crust at the top was so good It was served piping hot and the dish was super flavourful It even had some red bean paste at the bottom Overall there were some hits and some misses I found a lot of their deep fried items too oily and definitely skip all their fake meat items but Im going to give them another shot for dinner,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Leena S.,2019-07-10,4,Im a big fan of dim sum and being a vegetarian it cant get any better then this Great options on the menu whole variety of items you can choose from The fake meat actually tastes really good and good flavours,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Jess S.,2020-05-18,4,I will definitely order from here again but wiser for the next time I ordered 3 dishes and that came to just over 55 I really enjoyed the food and all the yummy veg options that were available I wish there was more descriptions in the menu but its just my preference I ordered Assorted Vegetables Chili  Pepper Deep Fried Tofu and Pan-Fried Oyster Mushroom on Broccoli The Assorted Vegetables came on a bed of noodles and the noods to veg ratio was perfect The tofu was excellent Not greasy and mild spice I prefer heat  but this is perfect for most spice levels The mushroom dish was my least favorite It was a bit too salty for me The food was good I think its an awesome veg option to order with a big group so you can taste multiple dishes I definitely will try this place again,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Samuel C.,2019-06-08,5,"A Great Great Great Vegetarian Restaurant If you are on Kingsway and you pass Sun Bo Kong and you can not go in to eat say you are busy or you have an appointment You should at least stop in front of Sun Bo Kong put your palms together in praise and bow at least once before continuing on your way This restaurant is that good    Note that this is NOT repeat NOT a Chinese fake meat restaurant Unlike the many many Chinese vegetarian restaurants run by the Supremely Well-Dressed and Legitimately Wise Master Ching Hai there is no chicken made of gluten fish made of gluten beef made of gluten pork made of gluten or hot dogs made of gluten The Ching Hai restaurants are fine places to eat  but they are generally celebrations of the miracle of gluten Sun Bo Kong is about vegetables as vegetables Vegetables as vegetables in 532,838 different magnificent manifestations The menu is huger than huge My vegetarian wife who normally gets to order from one section of the menu called vegetarian and has only one to eight choices at any restaurant literally found herself overwhelmed with pages and pages and pages of choices  all of which she could have Her happiness knew no bounds About one fifth of the menu is vegetarian dim sum Those items were particularly stellar I never got to try my wifes steamed vegetable dumplings because the love of my life inhaled them in six and a half nanoseconds The Barbecue Buns Note  NOT Gluten Barbecue Pork buns Barbecue Vegetable buns were long narrow and cylindrical unlike the BBQ pork buns you know from Cantonese Dim Sum The pastry was buttery and flaky not unlike a phyllo dough The pastry in regular pork buns is gummy The dominant taste was in the pastry not in the filling as is the case the pork buns you are used to It was vegan Nevertheless it was pure buttery golden goodness The filling  Barbecued Something possibly palm root or taro  played a savory supporting role We were in absolute heaven My main dish was what they called a traditional vegetarian hotpot Hotpot lovers take note They had a whole two thirds of a page of vegan hotpot dishes The hotpots come in a rainbow array of flavors Traditional hotpot was Never mind the sauce Enjoy the vegetables for what they are The vegetables as they were were magnificent I could identify most of them  but they were pretty exotic Most were obscure items from a Chinese grocerys produce section or dried goods sections You know the ones I mean The ones that you dont buy even though you really want to because you dont know how to prepare the ingredients These people know how to prepare the ingredients Prepare to be both happy and endlessly entertained My wife got a three mushroom soup that was nice but not as fun as the other items The flavoring for the three mushrooms was seaweed in industrial quantities I can see how mushrooms and seaweed could theoretically get along However we both like our mushroom soups to be a little less astringent and a little more on the savory side That said with the vegetarian dim sum and hot pots we were in a generalized state of ecstasy So the mushroom soup could be whatever it wanted to be Oh  and for the record  Servings of anything that is not dim sum are HUGE Dont go overboard when you order    Overall this is an establishment of limitless inventiveness And endless vegetable treats In a city crammed with destination Chinese restaurants It is hard to say Dont Leave Vancouver without going to Establishment X But Sun Bo Kong really is an establishment you dont want to miss So if you really do choose not to eat here Make sure you to to a place that leaves you really ecstatic Sun Bo Kong will leave you really ecstatic",Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Clara B.,2019-10-25,5,Three for three excellent visits  definitely my current nom-nom Chinese restaurant of choice for vegetarian and vegan friendly dining spots Literally everything okay except the taro rolls which are better across the road weve ordered has been delish  bean curd rolls the black bean option is our favourite  drumsticks  traditional vegetarian hotpot  deep friend oyster mushrooms  hot and sour soup  their version of yin yong  eggplant hotpot The list goes on though Service has been lovely theyre friendly in a way almost like were friends that theyre having around for a meal at their restaurant Also portions are definitely generous so either dine with a group or look forward to taking leftovers home Definitely looking forward to our next visit,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Justine S.,2021-01-01,5,Soooooooooo good Get the bean curds in black bean sauce Best Chinese food in the city  vegetarian or not Delicious but not too greasy,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Kasumi Y.,2019-06-26,2,June 11  2019 I went for lunch with 3 girls Worst services ever they all day dreaming We had Large gluten combination the yellow one with curry and the red color are good rest of them too hard to eat and too salty Deep fried lotus roots they used dated oil to fry it too oily Crispy turnip pastry my friend told us its famous here but nothing special to me same as kirin and napton restaurant Steamed rice roll vegetarian fish and Chinese donut its tasty and crispy but rice roll was too thick Vegetarian bean curd on noodles with black beans sauce too salty for me Turnip cake with xo sauce soso Crispy seaweed besncurd wrapped with bean sprouts and mixed mushrooms this is only dish I like but its 17 Bamboo pith roll  nothing special Its about 91 + tips for 4 people lunch,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Jonny M.,2019-09-09,3,O was in town so I suggested we check out a dim sum place that specializes in vegetarian food Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant Theyre sister restaurants to Po Kong which is directly across the street from them We dropped in on a Sunday afternoon around 12:15pm and it was busy Luckily we were able to get a table right away but if youre a bigger group make a reservation The inside is typical Chinese fashion Service is standard too Theres a couple menus but we were here strictly for dim sum Prices range in the 4.50 to 6.25 range  4x Tea  lame that they charge 1.10/person for tea Im sure if you bring your Asian grandma they can get it nullified  Steamed rice flour roll with pea tips 6.25  interestingly they bring the sauce on the side for you Decent but pricey  Panfried turnip cake 4.50  this was good Slightly pan fried but not greasy at all Think a healthy cleaner version of the usual lo bak go  Vegetable shrimp dumpling 4.95  their version of ha gow Was okay but nowhere near the real thing  Steamed mushroom dumplings 4.95  tasty filling and dumpling had a chewy satisfying texture  Panfried veggie bun 5.25  the bun wasnt pan fried enough  Mini 5-grain wrap 5.25  wild rice mushroom and some other things Solid  Panfried stuffed eggplant 4.95  the eggplant was bit too soft and gooey but the crunchy part on top was good  Steamed bean curd wrap 4.75  enoki mushroom on top This was another well excuted dish  Steamed BBQ bun 4.25  not bad but the bun wasnt fluffy  2x Corn oatmeal siu mai 4.95  you read that right Corn and oatmeal filling This was bland and the texture was nowhere like a real siu mai Skip it  Mango green tea pancake 5.95  never seen this before everyone liked it Diced mango and shredded coconut The pancake had a satisfying bite to it Stick with anything mushroom related and youll be happy Suprisingly decent vegetarian offerings at SBK 3.5 stars,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Alvin L.,2019-07-04,4,Never had vegetarian dim sum before but I really enjoyed my experience and would come back again with my parents whom are both vegetarian The deep fried taro rolls were excellent ask for their hot sauce and so was their soup dumplings I also really enjoyed their pan fried turnip cakes and steamed dumplings If youre vegetarian this is a must try  if youre not a vegetarian I would still recommend Sun Bo Kong,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
D R.,2019-11-13,1,Quick review for now They wouldnt serve our party because it included a disabled person and her professionally trained beautifully behaved service dog Other customers might have allergies or not like it Illegal and just horrible Go across the street to Po Kong Theyre great have a very similar menu and dont discriminate against people with disabilities Yum,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Simon S.,2017-10-22,4,DISCLAIMER I grew up eating Chinese food and my moms wonton soup so Chinese food is comparatively mundane for me If its a delicious novelty for you then you might want to rate this restaurant higher NOTE This is a vegetarian Chinese restaurant that uses meat substitutes Part of my positive tilt on how I rate them is in the quality of the fakeness of the meat B14 Assorted Vegetables and Wonton in Soup 12.95 Overall pretty ordinary tasting In fact Im a bit inclined to give it bonus points for tasting just like my moms home cooking Not exactly thick with wontons since this is mixed wontons and vegetables and it says so right in the menu name so if youre looking for tons of wontons and just token veggies you might want to check with the server for something else to order The wontons are themselves quite interesting from a fake-meat point of view They actually taste fairly close to pork But more than that they actually make an effort to have it look like pork-and-shrimp wontons If you cut open one youll likely see a fat chunk of fake prawn It doesnt taste like prawn tastes more like bland nothing if you isolate it and taste it but the appearance is comforting for omnivores that might be missing meat C27 Veggie Balls and Mushrooms with Black Pepper Sauce 13.95 Pretty simple and tasty Sauce not too strong though so if youre worried about that or looking forward to a very strong pepperiness check with your server Except for the shape the veggie balls are pretty good at passing for tender chunks of fake chicken And camouflaged amongst the comparably sized mushrooms you might not even notice the odd shapes If youre looking for fake chicken this is probably better than the overtly fake-looking chicken options NOT swimming in oily sauce This is good G10 Baked Fried Rice with Pumpkin and Cheese 16.95 Weird to see cheese and pumpkin in a Chinese restaurant much less in the same dish I recommend you try it Its not only novel but the sauce makes it pretty tasty Its also a LOT of rice  the server rated a single order as being enough rice for five persons Certainly on its own its a meal for two It does NOT taste like Kraft cheddar mac n cheese Nor does it taste like someone melted an awful lot of cheddar on top In fact it doesnt taste like cheese so much The sauce that doesnt harden up like cheese when it cools kind of tasted to me like a sweet not-spicy-hot curry The pumpkin comes in small wedges with some of the green skin on but baked enough to be tender and sweet Make sure you scoop up some Service very friendly and helpful to non-Chinese speakers Not a lot of small tables for 2-4 so if youre a duo you might get stuck with a small table basically at the kitchen exit and the only other option is only a bit farther away,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Colin L.,2021-03-01,5,This is my fave Chinese food in Vancouver They are also SOOO nice and honest The last time we were there when we ordered the server down-sold us because she said it was too much food She was right Haha,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Kwok C.,2019-11-10,5,So far the best vegetarian Chinese restaurant we have found in Pacific Northwest Has extensive choices of dim sum lunch and dinner entrée Our go to place whenever we visit Vancouver area,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Ruben M.,2019-05-30,4,This place is fantastic for their dim sum for any vegetarian Im glad that this was an option We came here for dinner and got the Chili Eggplant with Tofu hot pot Fantastic Unfortunately their Singapore curry noodles were pretty flavorless The dim sum was fantastic and would recommend to anyone who is vegetarian or vegan and even remotely likes Chinese food Definitely give it a look,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Karen C.,2018-08-28,3,Food was so-so a little disappointing We ordered a lot of different dishes to get a good feel for this place Im afraid the only thing we liked was the noodles we ordered to go with the wonton dish We thought we ordered wonton noodle soup but apparently not so had them add that Service was average,Sun Bo Kong Vegetarian Restaurant
Jinsae H.,2021-09-27,4,Ratings based on food quality alone Appetizers Caviar and Oysters  7.2/10 An incredibly creamy bite that introduces you to the world of shellfish umami The distinct sensation of the sea is refreshing instead of overpowering and there is no unpleasant aftertaste Summer Corn Chowder  3.8/10 As the name suggests a very light and subtle aromatic starter Unfortunately aside from the lobster tail it was a little too subtle for any flavors to leave a lasting impression The texture was neither that of a chowder nor a soup somewhere in between akin to a froth Baby Back Ribs  8.1/10 One of the better lightly sauced Asian-inspired braised ribs on the market The tenderness is executed to an industry T and the sesame glaze makes even returning to the plate for just garnishes worth it Entrée Scallop and Crispy Pork Belly  8.4/10 If there was a contender for most bang for your buck at this establishment this dish is sure to be the strongest Nothing short of artisanal and technical excellence with pork belly crusted two-way a layered herb crust and a multi-nut crust combined with butternut squash purée and plum chutney as sauces The scallops dissolve on the tongue as if you were having a second helping of corn chowder and the pork belly added the perfect contrast with a scrumptious crunch The squash purée and lobster tail add-on were appreciated but were not as memorable in comparison to the main attractions especially when paired with the plum chutney that was just the right amount of sweet with hints of a chili kick Dessert Hazelnut Praline Bar  9.3/10 The uncontested star of the show There is simply not much more to attribute to this masterpiece other than that Potentially one of the most revitalizing passionfruit sorbets in fine-dining beautifully married with a crackling milk-chocolate praline bar teetering on the bitterness of a darker chocolate A further description of all the elements on this dish would not be as apropos as trying it yourself Overall Rating  7.36/10,Hawksworth Restaurant
Drea S.,2021-09-27,5,Came back to Hawksworth again a few times after the first time to give it another chance I have to say theyve impressed me They not only have incredible food drinks and service are all mind blowing Thank you guys for all your hard work Updating my review and letting you guys know this place is worth giving another try Not only did I try it again once but I tried it over and over again The quality of the menu and the friendliness of the staff stayed consistent over the last few visits Thank you guys,Hawksworth Restaurant

Audrey W.,2021-07-28,5,Epic happy hour not well known but a really high end burger made to order and an old fashioned for 19 1.5 oysters that goes along with it total beyond worth it,Hawksworth Restaurant
Jurn L.,2021-03-31,5,Little did we know that this would be our last time dining in for at least 3 weeks Enjoyed an amazing meal at Hawksworth Restaurant on Sunday night March 28 We ordered Appetizers  Kusshi Oysters  Crab and Sidestripe Shrimp Toast  Charcuterie Platter  Alberta Beef Steak Tartar  Mushroom Risotto with Truffles special Entrees  Yarrow Meadows Duck Breast add-on Foie Gras  Sablefish add-on Lobster Tail  Crispy Pork Belly  Roasted Scallop add-on Lobster Tail The meal was phenomenal Everything tasted absolutely delicious I really cant pick a favourite because it was all so good Our server Eric provided exceptional service It couldnt have been a more perfect meal before the dine-in hiatus,Hawksworth Restaurant
Charna B.,2021-08-01,5,Thé 3 course lunch here is the best deal going Me and my foodie group come here usually every second week when the lunch menu changes Service is always fantastic This weeks lunch was the best Started with a chickpea panisse which is like a fritter Main course was lightly seared tuna in an amazing curry which I have to admit I licked the bowl  dessert was a raspberry lemon earl grey tart Lunchtime could not get better than this  oh and try the lavender vanilla house made ice tea Its so refreshing and feels like you are in Provence,Hawksworth Restaurant
Renee W.,2021-03-03,5,What a fabulous spot for a romantic and classy date night We came here for Valentines Day and had the 6 course menu and it was absolutely amazing The pairings were all unique yet flavourful and delicious  not to forget the plating Unfortunately I cannot remember the names of all these plates  The service was great and the food came at the perfect pace and we will definitely be coming back for more,Hawksworth Restaurant
Luke Y.,2020-08-27,5,Price/quality 4/4 Got the tasting menu and every course tasted amazing The salad looked particularly impressive while the fish was great too The tiramisu was the one that blew me away--it had all the traditional flavours but it was presented as something that was deconstructed Service 1/1 Service was friendly and effective Would I come here again Yes They currently have a patio too,Hawksworth Restaurant
Vineet S.,2021-07-15,1,First time to the restaurant with my colleagues and was highly disappointed with the food Really expensive for very small portions and tasteless food I ordered a lobster roll it came in Texas toast and had no taste to the food The presentation was similar to a food truck offering My colleagues also were not impressed with their orders Will never go back and not recommend to anyone,Hawksworth Restaurant
Loewe C.,2020-06-23,5,Came here to celebrate our anniversary and we were blown away by their exceptional service and professionalism during covid We felt safe the facilities were clean and the food was delicious We ordered the seafood platter steak tartare beef tenderloin sablefish caramel pot de creme and the apple tart We really enjoyed our mains and desserts and appreciated the handwritten card and complimentary sparklings They were also very accommodating to my request to change out the beans in the sablefish for another ingredient All in all a perfect night and a great option if you are celebrating a special day The Hawksworth team really tries their best to make your night special Read my full review on my blog https://sincerelyloewe.com/hawksworth-anniversary-dinner,Hawksworth Restaurant
Amy D.,2021-10-22,5,My husband and I celebrated our 20th anniversary at Hawksworth and it by far surpassed our expectations From the minute we were greeted at the door to the end of our meal we were blown away by the service and attention to detail not to mention the food Thank you to the entire staff for making it a memorable experience We cant wait until we can visit again,Hawksworth Restaurant
Jan Dustin G.,2020-11-07,5,They are open during the pandemic with very specific ways to keep diners safe They are by reservation although it will be a long wait if you want to walk-in The ambiance is beautiful with enough spaces to socially distance Its noisier than I expected but bearable The food is exquisite and that is where the strength is It took time for them to prepare our food but it was worth the wait I like the KFC the seafood platter and the Wagyu burger also the duck breast We tried the foie gras and my partner absolutely loved it The servers are nice and they explain everything they serve We ate so much we did not have room for desert will try next time though,Hawksworth Restaurant
Christina L.,2020-03-04,4,Good food and service here I like that its classy but relaxed without being pretentious The steak and eggs at brunch are delicious and so are the macarons The fresh orange juice was kind of bitter for some reason which was too bad We also enjoyed the bennys and French toast I liked the steak so much that Ive orders it twice already Some of the tables are very close to each other so conversations can get a bit loud and when the waiter was cleaning the table next to us we couldnt help but notice that the waiters bum was right next to us like really close No biggie though haha,Hawksworth Restaurant
Manbir R.,2020-01-21,4,"Vancouver city is blessed with abundance of food places including some top chef/michelin award winner fine dinning restaurants like hawksworth Chef david hawksworth planted his lavish restaurant inside the immaculate lobby of rosewood georgia hotel vancouver very accessible n easy to find As usual parking is on the road so better walk here from nearby parking lots We got lucky to get parking right around the corner Warm and inviting ushers/hosts take ur name down to check ur reservations n then ur coats if u wanna hang them safe We did the same and got our token number A lady guided us to our table and along the way  we were greeted by most of the staff members in a welcoming manner The moment we sat down to observe the ambiance i really liked the well layed cutlery on the tables many staff members standing probably to keep check of their respective tables assigned A beautiful big painting of a book cover was eye catching Dim lights and modern decor just finished the touches of fine dine restaurant Menu was full of globe spanning list of liquor like wines champagne,whiskeys,vodka,rum,italian vermouth n angostura some base of herb n spices So let me tell you that a drink called indulgent Manhattan worth 125 will hit you in seconds Its sour though n its just 3 oz I dont know why but our server asked us twice if we wanted that drink worth 125 I would say maybe we got to dress little more expensive to proof our wealth money honey Fine dinning here doesnt mean tiny portions just to make the plate dirty but actually serves the purpose hunger Menu is definitely fine tuned every now and then to bring new additions of local and seasonal ingredients Winter BC jan menu page had very interesting choices but we sticked to our vegetarian options only Surprise there were some Our brussal sprouts appetizer was very very delicious with a tinch of sweetness maybe maple syrup Salad with chickpeas was quite fulfiling  Duck breast was well cooked as i suggested I am sure we ordered brassica as our main course instead we got something else but my BF doesnt like to create a scene so he had the vegetarian bowl which was fried brocolli n other veggies in a very tangy sauce  that took the 5th star away Rest all was perfect Eye pleasing plates knowledgeable service paired with expertly addressing of all staff members I would say its absolutely worth the splurge and i would do that again",Hawksworth Restaurant
Susan R.,2021-08-23,1,I booked a few weeks in advance GM sent a message to personally say thank you for the booking I messaged him back that we were specifically coming for the tasting menu Then a day before I was reconfirm and a discussion even took place about what was on the tasting menu 3.5 hours prior to our scheduled seating we were called to advise the tasting menu was no longer offered Seriously This was my 50th birthday booking and they were well aware the ONLY reason we booked was for the tasting menu Try getting another reservation elsewhere for a well rated restaurant in Vancouver with 3.5 hours notice Sadly this restaurant will go down as the least professional I have ever run into and Ive traveled extensively worldwide Shame on you and your General Manager Josh should be tossed,Hawksworth Restaurant
Yuri Y.,2020-02-04,4,Walking in on a Monday night with one other person and sat in the lounge because the restaurant was full Not surprised given its attached to a hotel and its a well known place Cocktails were very good Moon Milk was mezcal almond milk lime grapefruit falernum angostura bitters and s as cinnamon stick I will order this again for sure if I come here again I also got a Bacardi 10 years old fashioned which was great As for food everything was great but not life changing See photos for what we ordered This was a good amount of food for two hungry ppl Stand outs were the soup cheese plate and banana ice cream The cheeses were all amazing The only thing I didnt really like was the scallops  too salty but might just be me The carrot cake was pretty good and it had these gelatinous carrot flavored strips over it which was special One other thing that really stood out was the bartender who was mainly attending to us Taku He was attentive and friendly and gave excellent drink recommendations Really enhances my dining experience Id come here again for sure for food but it was as little expensive so not a casual frequent thing I did expect that and am definitely not complaining about it though I will likely come more frequent too just sit at the bar and make my way through their cocktail menu,Hawksworth Restaurant
Clara C.,2019-12-02,4,Stopped by Hawksworth on a weekday for lunch and it was a pleasant fine dining experience with mostly older couples tourists and working professionals as the usual dining audience Items Tried Sea Bass  34 4/5 Taste The sea bass was quite fresh and flaky with a crispy skin that complimented the flesh of the fish well The braised fennel was cooked to just the right texture not too soft not too crunchy However I thought the overall appearance of the dish was a bit lacking and the saffron broth that the dish was drenched in was not super appetizing to eat/look at Portion Size On the smaller side for 1 person  satisfying if accompanied with an appetizer and/or dessert Dark Chocolate Chantilly  14 5/5 Taste The dark chocolate was fantastic it was a decadent mousse like texture that was not too overly sweet and paired well with the raspberry chocolate Portion size Smaller dessert size for 1 person Value for Money The high price point is well-matched by the amazing restaurant ambiance the high quality food and the exceptional service I had an overall wonderful experience at Hawksworth,Hawksworth Restaurant
Emily L.,2020-09-07,2,Dined here about a month ago The food was 4 stars but the service was terrible I complained the manager promised me a gift card and have yet to receive it after a month Also recently they have had a case of COVID amongst staff We want to support restaurants but our money is hard-earned too so I expect a certain level of customer service and good quality food if I am spending over 150 for lunch for two Where is my gift card Seriously Dont promise something if you cant deliver,Hawksworth Restaurant
Sharon L.,2019-10-13,4,So we booked online a month prior to coming here for lunch 2 weeks before we emailed them asking if we can have 1 hour later than our time we wanted originally booked our flight time had changed and we even called and left a message no one answered back 24 hours before our reservation date they emailed stating that the 1pm reservation was ok They need to improve on answering back faster to customers because of their lack of response we booked another restaurant for brunch as a backup My family took the steak and eggs and it was delicious and cooked perfectly to their desired taste the beef brisket was very tasty and juicy the cod was very good The meat and fish dishes were very excellent As for the vegetarian dishes there were not many choices only 3 I took the ratatouille dish It was good but nothing special The ratatouille lack of flavor I had to add salt and pepper I wished they would have put more effort into their vegetarian dishes.The desert was delicious The service was good too,Hawksworth Restaurant
Mel J.,2021-05-19,5,If all vegan pizza were all this good I would eat it everyday I order 3 pies stranger wings carne asada  ultraviolet for my family Stranger wings was absolutely the favorite The cauliflowers wings were cooked perfectly  not soggy The sauce was super tasty Just like eating the real wings sauce Order this if youre hesitant to try vegan pizza Our second favorite was carne asada We were surprised that the vegan steak curls were super delicious The pineapple gave a fresh palate cleanser that complimented the pizza The Ultraviolet was good too but the other 2 pies blown our taste buds so much that overshadowed it Personally I think that the cashew mozzarella is the important ingredient that makes all the pizza tasted delicious The crust had the perfect thickness that the pizza wasnt soggy I would definitely order more,Virtuous Pie
Leeza N.,2021-10-24,5,Ive been to this Virtuous Pie location since their very first opening and I can say Im a huge fan Ive tried many of their items here my favourites being the Superfunghi pizza the ultraviolet pizza and the mac and cheese VP does vegan food so well that it doesnt feel like what youre eating is a vegan version of a dish it just tastes so good They also use really fresh ingredients and the staff is always friendly I like how now you can sit down and they take your order compared to before where you had to pay at the till VP is a solid choice when it come to high quality delicious vegan food,Virtuous Pie
Nicole G.,2021-09-26,5,I order VP regularly via Door Dash The garlic knots pictured are hands down my favourite item on the menu The sauce they come with is equally great The Superfunghi Pizza is delicious as is the kale salad It feels like quality clean eating food My preferred vegetarian restaurant in Vancouver,Virtuous Pie
Leah M.,2021-10-31,1,It cost me 54.00 for these two pizzas that were cold and squished when they were delivered,Virtuous Pie
Annie P.,2021-01-22,5,What is there to say about VP that hasnt already been said Is this place a portal to an alternate dimension where everything is beautiful and nothing hurt If eating is your fav coping mechanism then YES Does Virtuous Pie have the answers to all of lifes unanswerable questions If you cant answer those questions because youre hangry then YES Does Virtuous Pie make vegan food fun/accessible without being scary and intimidating YESSSSSS There are few things I enjoy more than a stranger wings pizza with extra garlic ranch and side of garlic knots bread on bread on bread baby If you havent been GO NOW If you have been GO BACK And bring me a pizza while you are at it,Virtuous Pie
Julia H.,2020-04-05,4,This is a great place for vegan pizza one of the best I would say It can get quite busy on the weekends and you may have to wait 15-20 mins for your pizza Everything is freshly made and its really light I would say its more like a flatbread than an actual pizza since its not as saucy and cheesey My favourite is the stranger wings buffalo cauliflower Super flavourful and yummy Would also get their kale salad and tator tots on the weekends,Virtuous Pie
Sara W.,2020-01-02,5,When my friend decided to go vegan for the month and said we should eat here Ill admit I was a little wary How good could vegan pizza be As it turns out its absolutely delicious perhaps even better than your standard pizza Making a good pizza dough is an under-appreciated skill so I have mad respect for whoever makes the dough here There was a perfect balance between chewy and crispy I got the superfunghi which was excellent but as soon as I took a bite of my friends mac + cheeza pie I could not focus on anything else I never say this about pizza but it was to die for AND IT WAS VEGAN We also got ice cream They have a nice selection of flavours and the ice cream itself was delicious but it paled in comparison to the pizza The next opportunity I get Im going back and I think we all know what Ill be ordering,Virtuous Pie
Breanne T.,2020-02-09,4,Finally got to try virtuous pie I didnt realize it was kind of a cafeteria/subway style restaurant but it was quick and easy It was quite busy when we got there but we were able to grab a seat on the end as there is limited seating Love the ambiance We had to try the Mac and cheese which I dont regret at all Definitely hard to finish it all though when we ordered a pizza each We got the mushroom one and the one with cauliflower Both very good and a perfect personal size I think there couldve been a little more cauliflower/ingredients on mine but it was still very good We enjoyed our pizzas Mac and cheese and beers will definitely be visiting again soon to try all the other pizzas that sound amazing,Virtuous Pie
Chloe C.,2020-05-16,3,Honestly I wish I could say that I loved this place since I had a fantastic vegan pizza from Leef and Stem a week ago Unfortunately the pizza I got was disappointing and so Ill have to look elsewhere for some good vegan pizza I also got some sushi from the Harken Coffee collaboration which was decent Sweet Pepper + Sausage Pizza 3/5 I was so excited for this but this pizza fell completely short of my expectations The pizza dough was very chewy and had a strange texture while the cheese was spongy and plasticy My meat-loving vegan-food-hating brother ate two slices though which was very surprising though I did pick all the cheese since it tasted strange and sweet peppers he hates those off by then The sausage mince was decent but was definitely mushier than real meat The seasoning was a bit spicy which was nicely balanced by the hot honey The honey definitely added a unique touch but the pizza definitely needed more of it to counteract the heat There was a decent amount of toppings but I do wish there was slightly more meat This pizza was underwhelming and I wouldnt get it again Inari Sushi 4/5 The flavour was nice and mild and I liked how the bean curd pocket wasnt sickly sweet like those you normally get at regular sushi places I wish there was more filling and sauce since it was quite heavy on the rice I couldnt really taste the sesame sauce on the spinach but I thought the addition of tempeh was interesting Spicy Tuna Roll 4/5 The flavour of this roll was good and my non-vegan brother had no idea that it was tomato and not tuna I liked the crunch from the pumpkin sunflower and sesame seeds on top but I definitely would have liked more filling since Im not really a rice person and I just want the filling It also wasnt spicy at all which I was completely fine with since Im not the biggest fan of spicy foods anyway If youre looking for good vegan pizza I would go to Leef and Stem I personally think that this place is overhyped but to each their own,Virtuous Pie
Mimi Y.,2019-12-17,4,Mmm much better than the UBC location The crust was nice and chewy much more like regular pizza and I liked the flavours I chose this time a lot better I went with the Superfunghi which had great mushrooms on it It was still slightly bland so the tableside parmesan sriracha and chili pepper flakes were helpful I also tried my friends Street Corn and Pesto CBR I think I liked the Sweet Corn the best because it was sweet and savoury great if you like Hawaiian pizza loaded with corn kernels I liked the chicken on the Pesto CBR but it was also slightly bland We also shared some garlic knots and they were very delicious Chewy and well seasoned by parmesan and bacon and of course garlic They didnt skimp on the garlic The ranch dipping sauce it came with was also yummy I also liked that they had both sparkling and flat water on tap,Virtuous Pie
Sofie P.,2021-01-25,3,Ill stick with the pizza next time which are bomb I wanted to try something new so I got the garlic knots which were really good and the Mac and Cheese Skillet which was not I didnt enjoy it at all The cheese had a kinda sweet taste to it I cant explain it Not a fan,Virtuous Pie
Caroline L.,2019-08-11,5,My mother switched to a vegan lifestyle couple months ago and I was so excited to try Virtuous Pie with her We decided to get  Margherita Pizza 12  Stranger Wings 14 Because margherita pizza is my favourite pizza and obviously wanted to try the famous vegan wings My mom and I instantly fell in love Both tasted so SO delicious Their wings  seriously though How on earth does that taste so much like real wings I swear I could not tell the difference My mom was obsessed with the cauliflower wings Although both pizzas were delicious their ALMOND PARMESAN CHEESE was SO amazing I am a huge fan of parmesan but I thought this tasted even better My tip would be to sprinkle it A L L over your pizza Next time Ill probably bring more people so I could try more options bigappetiteproblemss lol and go during Happy Hour because they have great deals I recommend Virtuous Pie to anyone who loves pizza,Virtuous Pie
Emily S.,2019-02-04,5,OMG SO GOOD I never knew vegan pizza could be this delicious P My friend and I ordered the super funghi and the grandma I preferred the grandma because it was flavourful creamy and unexpectedly satisfying didnt miss dairy cheese at all The funghi was good but I felt it needed a bit more oomph so I covered it in almond parmesan The almond parmesan definitely helped but next time I might see if I can add toppings to the grandma I think the grandma with mushrooms would be heavenly A few other notes the atmosphere was stylish with large group tables meant for sharing with strangers Which fostered a nice community environment Wouldnt do an intimate date there but great for friendly hangouts The staff were polite and friendly The washroom was massive...just wish there was more than one washroom Maybe we were there at peak hours but there was a bit of a wait for it Otherwise the place is pretty perfect another gem in the crown of vegan restaurants in Vancouver HIGHLY RECOMMEND,Virtuous Pie
Kristin U.,2019-04-14,5,Update Almost a year since my last visit I was able to go back for more vegan icecream They were out of the gluten free waffle cones oh no But the man working suggested a gluten free ice cream sandwich instead and I jumped on that I ordered the mint chocolate icecream  the one I loved most last time It was perfect with the chocolate chip cookie Such a satisfying treat Virtuous Pie lived up to my hopes and dreams Ill be back Went to explore Chinatown today and did a quick Yelp search for gluten free food before I left I am SO glad I did because it led me to Virtuous Pie I saw they had a gluten free waffle cone and vegan ice cream and knew I HAD to go there I found the shop pretty easily as we walked the streets There was a sign on the door saying their AC was broken and it was quite warm inside But the smell of pizza and allure of vegan ice cream prompted me inside They had about five ice cream options today and I couldnt quite decide so I went with two scoops of ice cream in a gluten free waffle cone I got a matcha and coconut scoop and a mint and dark chocolate scoop You guys I cannot say enough good things about this ice cream It was SO tasty The mint and dark chocolate was by far my favorite Oh I could eat pints and pints of that The matcha was pretty good too And the waffle cone Perfection I cant even tell you the last time I could walk into a place and grab an ice cream cone Next time Im in Vancouver I know exactly where Im headed for a treat And maybe Ill actually get some pizza next time too,Virtuous Pie
Amy C.,2019-04-29,4,Had the chorizo and artichoke pizza which was delicious Flavorful toppings/sauce and crispy crust The vanilla bourbon ice cream was also yummy but I ordered one scoop and got more of like half a scoop TLDR give their pizza a go ice cream flavors are good but portions are small,Virtuous Pie
Stephanie T.,2019-10-26,5,Visited the ubc location as we had our furry daughter with us She was allowed to dine in with us on the patio Here is what we ordered It wasnt as bad as I thought I tried everything the majority of the people on yelp recommended and it wasnt to shabby I was definitely full as heck and the kambucha was delicious down to the dessert It is self serve type of feel where you get your own water and cutlery and bring your own dishes back Fav was the mushroom pizza and the Thai ice cream This was a feast for two and it was more than enough as we had to get food to go Our furry daughter even had a little sample of the vegan Mac by accident ‍ its a nice near spot This is a good place to try,Virtuous Pie
Brent L.,2018-08-30,4,Was visiting here during one of the recent heat waves but boy was it stinking hot in here Their A/C was out at the time and the roaring fire from their oven definitely did not help lol The first pizza I tried was their Ultraviolet 11.00 The crust was thin and crispy with baked kale tangy tomato crunchy pine nuts and yummy salty cheese I also managed to try their Super Funghi 11.00 Out of the two this one definitely stood out more There was a crazy amount of bitter arugula salty mushrooms and some of this interesting salty ricotta with each bite Given the heat I also ordered their Matcha Coconut ice cream 5.00 as all of their other varieties were sold out It was super creamy buttery and had a nice coconut aftertaste Tasty pizza and ice cream albeit expensive Would come back to try their other pies as long as their A/C is in working order lol,Virtuous Pie
Suzan L.,2018-05-31,5,Anyone who says they dont love this place is lying And people still say vegan food is boring Have you TRIED Virtuous Pie Best pizza is Stranger Wings and the Pesto cbt Be warned though once you go there youll never be satisfied with Panago or Dominos ever again,Virtuous Pie
Donah O.,2019-10-02,5,I absolutely loved this place The pizza was soo good Everything here is vegan and vegetarian Cashew cheese whoa Soo fantastic Well flavored They also have vegan ice cream and kombucha in tap Totally worth it The staff are also fantastic Very kind and helpful,Virtuous Pie
Ally S.,2019-10-14,4,Second visit Between the 4 of us we shared the street corn Mac n cheese sausage and the margarita We also shared garlic knots Mac n cheese 11 and the side Brussels sprout salad 5 My fav pizza was the street corn I also liked the SA sausage more than I thought It had a good spice to it I also liked the other 2 but the street corn is for sure my fav First visit We got in just before happy hour ended 2 off pizza and 2 kombucha My friend and I split the ultraviolet and stranger wings and belini and hibiscus kombucha Ultraviolet good amount of pesto it wasnt overpowering I liked the kale and loved the caramelized onions Stranger wings it wasnt that spicy I love cauliflower and it was cooked just enough to make it not super crunchy but not mushy either One piece barley had any toppings I was worried the blue cheese drizzle would be gross but it was fine Kombucha drank them too fast to really get a feel for the flavours but for 2 just go dorn Id go back to try the los tacos and probably the other ones minus the mushroom one,Virtuous Pie
Clara Y.,2020-09-02,4,I was skeptical at first due to the poor reviews but I recently converted to becoming a vegan and I really wanted pizza so I gave it a try I ordered the seafood pizza and the ham and pineaplle pizza but small I made my pizza crust gluten free due to allergies and also ordered a beef donair I liked it Not sure why the reviews were so poor but I had the right amount of toppings cheese and it was delicious The gf crust is very different than most regular pizza stores Their crust is really thin like a tortilla wrap Im not complaining though because if youve ever tried gluten free crust you would know how horrendous it can taste The beef donair was soooo good It had little bits of fake meat lettuce and some vegan mayo or ranch sauce which was quite liquidy it also comes with onions but I dont like onions Their chicken donair comes with tomatos But I was super inflammed after eating half due to it not being gluten free Overall this place is good and I will order from here again,Vegan Pizza House
Angela K.,2020-09-05,5,My roommate is vegan so we order from here a lot I normally dont even like vegan pizza cuz the texture seems off and the cheese tastes weird to me However pizza from here is a different story This honestly tastes like normal pizza Its so good Love their Hawaiian the best Even more than pizza though I love their Greek dishes My favourite is the Spanakopita meal Not as good as from a real Greek restaurant but for a vegan dish its pretty awesome,Vegan Pizza House
Sofie P.,2020-10-28,4,Some really great options I love that they offer sizes to their orders too so I can try more  I got the Vegan Chicken Donair and Vegan Chicken Caesar Salad The donair was good could have used a bit more flavour but the salad was great I cant wait to try more things on the menu,Vegan Pizza House
Alexa R.,2019-01-28,1,I really wish I could eat here being one of the few vegan pizza places in town Unfortunately I have witnessed disturbingly unsanitary kitchen practices and the pizza itself is mediocre The place is clearly severely understaffed I have seen only one person working the entire thing which makes sense why my order has been delivered an hour late before Theres never enough cheese on the pizza and the vegan chicken and ham they use taste disgusting I saw the manager come out of the kitchen wearing gloves he was clearly cooking in ring up the order and handle money and then go back into the kitchen and continue handling food with the same dirty gloves Thats the equivalent of not washing your hands and definitely killed my appetite The whole kitchen looked dingy and unclean and one of the few tables in the restaurant had dirty dishes on them Would not order from here again,Vegan Pizza House
Mari E.,2017-03-05,3,As I was alone ordered vegan beef donair and taro bubble tea Vegan beef was quite tasty but they put tons of onions and less tomato  Totally onion breath after eating Maybe I will try regular pizza next time Taro nubble tea was kinda unique Half tea and half slushy And pearl was very very chewy/hard like gummy,Vegan Pizza House
Byron C.,2018-01-06,4,4 Stars There is street parking on Kingsway outside of rush hour and more around the surrounding residential area First impressions its a tiny hole in the wall place They crammed a couple of tables in the small area We are not vegan but wanted to try a healthier pizza option We ordered Combo 6  any large 3 topping pizza large lasagna 2pcs garlic bread tossed salad 29.95 Pizza  super thin crust so its floppy i personally liked the chewy texture of the crust It was really good Lasagna  the vegan meat sauce was different still tasty though Garlic bread  slices were not consistent not overly buttered like a lot of other places Tossed salad  the dressing was really good Service was ok Took the person working the cash register a while to figure out how much change I should get back Overall Experience Service  7/10 Cleanliness  6.5/10 Food  8.6/10 Value  7/10 Parking  7/10,Vegan Pizza House
Stephen S.,2017-06-20,1,Just arrived here at 1210 Yelp and the hours on the door clearly state that the business opens at 11:00 every day There is no one here and the doors are locked I made this trip from New Westminster to eat here based on the reviews Save yourself the trouble and dont bother An unreliable business is no business worth supporting Spend your money at any number of other vegan restaurants Thats what I will do,Vegan Pizza House
Karen L.,2016-08-25,4,I am not a vegan Actually Im not even close to being a vegan If you talk to any of my friends youll know that I like the concept of being vegan but I could never give up steak or other delicious meaty foods Thus the fact that I find the vegan pizza here delicious should serve as a testament to just how good their food is Their pizza crust is hands down some of the best that Ive ever had and I dont usually consider crust to be the selling point of a pizza for me Furthermore their fake meat toppings are surprisingly tasty as well As for the ambience of the place the service was good but the interior design could use a little work and modernization Whether youre vegan or not I would recommend giving this place a try if youre in the neighbourhood,Vegan Pizza House
Jess S.,2017-05-29,5,Thank you for being at the the 2017 Veg Expo I finally had the opportunity to try this pizza and Im so happy I did I ordered a take and bake Vegan Meat Lover Vegan Ham Chicken Capicollo Sausage Bacon Ground Beef gluten free It was 17 for a small add 2 for gluten free crust The crust is super thin and quite strong There is a lot of toppings and it withheld it all Light cheese which is perfect because the main event the meat is so delicious The flavours mimic that is real meat the spices and the texture was such a treat I cannot wait to go back here again,Vegan Pizza House
Kenneth N.,2016-04-08,4,I used to think that Rebellious Tomato in DT have the best vegan  daiya cheese VPH has just taken the hammer ever so slightly Lets face it not a place to take a date but does the job Good portions and while price is up there so is the quality Delivery and catering available All cards Parking challenging on Kingsway plenty of side street parking Friendly owner Another bonus workers use plastic gloves,Vegan Pizza House
Annie P.,2016-06-20,4,Probably the one thing I miss the most about living in this neighbourhood is having vegan pizza delivered to my doorstep I stumbled on Vegan Pizza House by accident and was hooked immediately and Im not even vegan There is something about their crust their preparation and their attention to detail that is far superior to most pizza joints in the neighbourhood It was the first time I even considered trying a cheeseless pizza and I have to say that with the right ingredients you wont even miss the cheese I liked the cheeseless pizza so much that Ive switched my preference almost completely to cheeseless It just tastes better And youre less sweaty and disgusting afterwards Its a win/win If youre not ready to made the leap to a totally cheeseless pizza they have vegan cheese options daiya which--while not my favourite cheese substitute--is still pretty damn close to the real thing,Vegan Pizza House
Gavin L.,2019-10-10,1,Gross honestly I dont like saying this but yeah it was really bad Very obscure sauces Made me feel like somebody was just testing out trying to make pizza for the first time Repulsive flavors honestly and too many types of dishes The kicker was the vegan seafood pizza WHY Also the vibe in the store was obscure and stinky,Vegan Pizza House
Hng T.,2020-02-12,5,My friend took me here once and it was amazing The food is so good I am not a vegan but their hawaian pizza had nailed me But my favorite is the donair It looks amazing and it taste so damn good Will try for many time more,Vegan Pizza House
Hannah B.,2019-07-18,4,I ordered the meat sauce spaghetti with garlic bread and salad A tasty meal lots of flavour and was a great substantial vegan meal Its fantastic to have a place as a vegan with so many Italian food influenced options Will be ordering from here again,Vegan Pizza House
Kermit K.,2019-01-25,5,I have always ordered pizza from here which is quite good but today i tried the souvlaki platter and it was amazing I ordered the beef and it was delish Meat eating bf loved it too So well seasoned and good texture Now i am looking forward to trying the donairs and baked lasagnas,Vegan Pizza House
Mark C.,2016-03-15,5,Great people who really care about Vegans choices being true Vegans themselves Pizza is amazing as is the Spaghetti and Lasagne So friendly and Ive not found a true 100% Vegan place in the area anywhere so they are worth coming back from even if Im an hour away,Vegan Pizza House
April T.,2019-05-27,5,Great pizza this is the only place where I like the cheese they put on vegan food great options with takeout/delivery,Vegan Pizza House
Patricia L.,2017-08-09,4,My go-to for vegan take out in Vancouver They have a wide range of vegan pizzas which fulfills all my junky pizza cravings I like that they have toppings comparable to the usuals that you would find with non-vegan pizza ie Plain Cheese Meat Lovers Hawaiian Their pizza is greasy goodness The owner is very friendly Ive heard that people have had issues with slow delivery times but I always order for pick up and have never had any problems,Vegan Pizza House
Steven S.,2017-12-29,4,Ive become vegan recently so we wandered into this pizza eatery and all was superb Even non-vegans will love these pizzas Super selection of toppings After a day of hiking and skiing these pizza pies hit our yum-yum tummies,Vegan Pizza House
Kat A.,2017-08-16,5,Whenever we are driving through the Kingsway area I always get several pizzas at the Vegan Pizza House So good to have a pizza feast after a hike or a long trip My favourite is the one with eggplants zucchinis smothered in a creamy sauce Ham and pineapple pizza is great too However if you are in downtown then you are now outside the delivery zone Gone are the days of delicious vegan pizza in the West End and downtown,Vegan Pizza House
