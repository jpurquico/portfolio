everyone!\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re all very aware of my previous work. Well, okay, not *my* previous work exclusively.\n\nThe work of my team and those like them, that is!\n\nLet me explain: Whenever we come across a cryptoid infested area, be it spiritual, unruly animals or just plain old unexplainable phenomena, my team comes in and jots down a handy list of rules for everyone to follow to avoid certain death.\n\nNow, why there\u2019s such a large number of folks who don\u2019t seem capable of following those rules is beyond me.\n\nSo, so many dead campers\u2026\n\nBut that\u2019s why we\u2019re having this Quality Assurance session!\n\nUs? We\u2019re the folks who go in and figure out what the rules are and, man oh man\u2026 Let me tell you, it ain\u2019t easy!\n\nSo, I\u2019m jotting this down at the moment to describe to everyone later, explain the happenings and hope that our latest set of rules will, in fact, be more helpful.\n\nBecause 5 minutes on this subreddit has really shown you guys are *terrible* at following written instructions\u2026 Rules especially! Bunch of rebels...\n\nWhich is weird!\n\nSo, clearly it\u2019s either an issue with the rules we\u2019re jotting down or you folks. So, help us out in finding the common denominator, will you?\n\nOkay, let's get going!\n\nSo, first I\u2019m going to introduce the team!\n\nWe are the **Occult Observation Catalogers** \\- OOC for short!\n\nThe team is composed of a number of our >!disposable!< interns!\n\nFirst off, we have Jhansi. He\u2019s a college student, of Indian descent. Has dark black hair, surprisingly green eyes and is about five foot six, I guess? Roughly, anyway, and he\u2019s here to get some \u2018field experience\u2019 - let's see how long that works out.\n\nWe\u2019ve got Rebecca, who really needs a job and we\u2019ve told her that just a few more trips out will get her all set up with something more long term. Honestly, I\u2019ve yet to clear that with the board, but she\u2019s made it to three weeks and that\u2019s a new record for field work!\n\nRebecca\u2019s a redhead who\u2019s not hard on the eyes and has brown eyes herself. She thinks I can\u2019t see through the blue contacts but I can. She\u2019s a little shorter than Jhansi, I think. Girl is always wearing platform shoes and a skirt. Leggings with it, of course. Guess that\u2019s the style these days. She\u2019s not indecent or anything, guess she just likes to look nice while on the job.\n\nOh, and lastly, we\u2019ve got Deter.\n\nDeter\u2019s from Sweden or Finland, honestly I can\u2019t remember which. Blonde hair, blue eyes, real tall Scandinavian fella! Nice kid but man oh man has he got a stack of bricks where his brain ought to be. He\u2019s got passable English, for the most part, but he\u2019s mostly here for the muscle. That boy\u2019s almost seven freaking feet tall! Real Viking if you ask me!\n\nAnyway: Today\u2019s goal? Visit a haunted house and determine what pisses the specter off and what apeases said spector. Then we\u2019ll jot down the rules for this house and leave them in the mailbox or with the owner, so that the next time one of you folks comes for an overnight stay, you might actually survive the night! (If you follow the rules\u2026)\n\nSo, first thing is first, we had to start off with the outside.\n\nDeter walked around with me, knocking on various parts of the house, rattling windows and checking the foundation for cracks or major signs of wear and tear.\n\nI\u2019m also checking for non-supernatural things. Termite damage, water seepage, maybe some unwanted erosion or chipping on the siding.\n\nDeter stopped, frozen for a moment.\n\nI sighed, \u201cFirst hit, okay... What\u2019s happening, Deter?\u201d\n\nDeter looked at his hands and they were twitching and shaking sporadically, \u201cI\u2026 I think I touched that window\u2026\u201d he said, pointing to the only window with a light on.\n\n\u201cI saw you touch the window there bud, mind giving it another knock?\u201d I figured he\u2019s already screwed. How much worse could it get?\n\nDeter went to the window and knocked again.\n\nI nearly dumped a load in my pants as the light shut off and a horrific specter\u2019s face smashed against the glass!\n\nDeter screamed and scrambled away from the window as I watched the face of what appeared to be a drowned woman press harder and harder against the glass.\n\nHer nose broke, as did her skin and black blood poured out of her wounds, covering the entire window in blackness before fading away.\n\nThe light flicked on again.\n\n\u201cRule Number One,\u201d I said, writing this down on my note pad despite my shaking hands, \u201cDo not knock on the window if the light is on,\u201d I checked my watch, \u201cAfter\u2026 Well it\u2019s 2 AM now but let's go with \u2018After Midnight\u2019 - that\u2019s usually when this shit gets all squirrely,\u201d I turned on my heel, \u201cYou alive, Deter?\u201d\n\nDeter cleared his throat, \u201cAh, yes. Yes, I alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cFantastic! Come on, we\u2019ve got more things to check out,\u201d I turned to him, \u201cOh, and no knocking on windows with the lights on, okay? I\u2019ve only got one set of underwear on me and I nearly ruined it,\u201d I turned, heading off towards the back yard, \u201cNot going commando today!\u201d\n\nDeter nodded, trembling and started following me.\n\nI heard twigs snapping and then heard Deter walking past me.\n\n\u201cDeter? What are you doing buddy?\u201d I asked.\n\nDeter\u2019s eyes were wide as he started moving towards the treeline, \u201cI see\u2026 Lights.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of lights buddy?\u201d I asked, having a good idea of where this was going.\n\n\u201cYellow lights! Look, don\u2019t you see them?\u201d Deter asked.\n\nI didn\u2019t see any lights as he made his way to the treeline.\n\nAfter he passed into the darkness of the woods, I heard him screaming.\n\nI sighed, \u201cRule Two: Do not enter the woods at night, especially if you see yellow lights\u2026\u201d I paused, \u201cBest just say \u2018Lights\u2019, pretty sure the color doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nDeter rushed out of the tree line, scrapes and bruises all over his face and body as he ran towards me, \u201cIt\u2019s after me!\u201d\n\nI sighed, \u201cI can see that, Deter.\u201d\n\nDeter turned and screamed in horror as tendrils of shadow whipped out of the tree line and wrapped around his body.\n\nI flinched as I spotted the tendrils pierce his skin with thorns and spikes before dragging him back into the woods.\n\nI underlined rule number two, \u201cVery Important,\u201d I said as I headed inside the house, \u201cDeter, if you survive, I\u2019ll be inside!\u201d\n\nAn inhuman roar echoed from the woods and I decided it was best to leave whatever it was alone. Deter was a big fella, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be fine.\n\nSurely better off than I'd be, so to avoid becoming the wood's next victim, I hurried inside. I'm not going to claim to have nerves of steel, but I sure as shit know when to run. Great advice from Kenny Rogers.\n\nIf not, there\u2019s always more interns.\n\nSpeaking of other interns\u2026\n\nI walked inside to find Jhansi clawing at his legs, which were sunk into the floor.\n\n\u201cWell, shit, what happened?\u201d I asked, doing my damndest to act concerned for his well being.  I poked the edge of the wooden floorboards with my pen, noting that his jeans and the floorboards didn\u2019t even have a seam. Like something had welded him to the ground.\n\n\u201cI-I was walking around and\u2026 and I found a loose board, so I kicked it to see if there was anything there! A-And then, the floor started to eat me!\u201d he sunk further into the floorboards, which I noticed were turning a deeper hue of red and appeared newer now. The fresh wood spread outwards from his body.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a shame,\u201d I sighed, \u201cOkay so, Rule number three: Do not damage or move any part of the house: Even if it appears broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cH-Help me!\u201d Jhansi cried out as he sank to his waist, \u201cOh God!\u201d\n\nThe flooring was looking brand new now and I cringed, looking around to ensure I wasn't going to be next, \u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much I can do,\u201d I said, stepping away from the new floor as it creeped outwards from his body at an alarmingly rapid rate.\n\nI stepped into the kitchen area, where it seemed the floor changed from hardwood to tile.\n\nI shuddered as Jhansi\u2019s screams grew more panicked as the floor sucked him in more and more. My stomach was uneasy. As many times as I had lost interns on these projects, it\u2019s usually a situation of rounding a corner to find one of them just dead or finding them turned into a statue.\n\nYou know, the normal shit? Still hard to get over, but that's what I'm used to.\n\nOne girl didn't follow a rule and wound up locked inside her house while a Velociraptor ran around outside and ate the neighbor\u2019s dog.\n\nWanna know the crazy part? Damn thing was a chicken during the day! Though we left pretty clear feeding instructions too\u2026 But I digress\u2026\n\nThis was much worse than I had seen before.\n\n\u201cH-Help! Please!\u201d Jhansi shouted as he clawed fruitlessly at the floorboards, now at chest height.\n\nHis nails broke on the hardwood, but the more damage he did, the faster he sank.\n\nFinally, when Jhansi reached out to try and pull himself out, well, his arms didn\u2019t come up!\n\nHis arms were now being devoured by the living room floor.\n\nWhich was looking very nice and updated now. It seemed it was even making the walls look like they had a fresh coat of paint.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jhansi screamed as his head was tilted back. \u201cNO!\u201d\n\nI shivered as his screams grew garbled and the house shook. It appeared his face was melting across the floor until finally I watched his green eyes turn brown and become nothing more than a pattern of knots on the new hardwood.\n\nRebecca came running down the steps as fast as her platform shoes allowed, her eyes wide in shock, \u201cWas Jhansi just screaming?\u201d She walked onto the new flooring, nothing happening to her.\n\nI sighed in relief, looking to rule three, \u201cLets see\u2026 Ah, okay, got it!\u201d I started rewriting rule three, \u201cDo not try to move or fix anything broken or you\u2019ll be used to fix what you break.\u201d I smiled, \u201cLooks nice and ominous, but not off-putting. Perfect!\u201d\n\n\u201cIs Jhansi gone?!\u201d Rebecca asked.\n\n\u201cSorry Rebecca, that\u2019s the sitch,\u201d I sighed, \u201cPoor bastard got eaten by the house and turned into some mahogany flooring,\u201d I knelt by the floor and gave it a knock, \u201cWow. That is some high quality stuff.\u201d\n\nRebecca narrowed her eyes on me, \u201c*Really*?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? The kid makes good hardwood apparently,\u201d I said standing up, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I did it to him! Nothing I could have done. He was waist deep in the floorboards by the time I found him.\u201d\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we have some kind of protection from this kind of stuff?\u201d Rebecca asked, \u201cOr are we just disposable?\u201d\n\n\u201cProtection like what? Half the time we don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re walking into,\u201d I shrugged, \u201cBesides, you\u2019re unpaid interns. It\u2019s either this or sitting in a cubical all day.\u201d\n\nRebecca rubbed the bridge of her nose, \u201cPlease just, tell me this is my last field job?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you that if you make it out of this one alive with a fresh set of rules, you\u2019re hired!\u201d I fibbed.\n\nI mean, it wasn\u2019t a lie exactly, I just wasn\u2019t certain. I could bring up my suggestion to the big bosses and all, but whether or not they\u2019d be up for a new hire was beyond my pay grade.\n\nI just observed.\n\nWe heard scratching and howling from the back door.\n\n\u201cH-Help! Let in! Please!\u201d Deter\u2019s voice called out.\n\nRebecca sighed, \u201cWhat did you do to Deter?\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, not me, it\u2019s the house,\u201d I pointed out, \u201cObservation is our middle name, remember?\u201d\n\nRebecca sighed and leaned out the back window, \u201cDeter, you there?\u201d\n\nI moved to the other window to see that, yes, Deter was there. His shirt was ripped, as was one pant leg. Deter was also missing a shoe. He was covered in blood, both red *and* black. Leaves and dirt were all over him. Leading from the forest, however, I could see he had some kind of tendril attached between his shoulder blades.\n\n\u201cYes, Rebecca! Is Deter! Please, let me in! Yes?\u201d Deter asked.\n\nI looked at Rebecca and shook my head.\n\nRebecca sighed, \u201cSorry, Deter,\u201d she went back in and closed the window.\n\nI closed my window just as Deter appeared before the window, smashing his hands against the glass.\n\n\u201cPlease! There is voice in my head! It says terrible things to do!\u201d Deter shouted, hammering on the glass but not breaking it.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Rebecca asked.\n\n\u201cEh, Eldritch horror or something got him,\u201d I said jotting down on my notepad, \u201cRule Four: Do not let anyone in, even if you think you know them.\u201d\n\nRebecca heaved a sigh, \u201cMaybe make a note about them being unable to harm you?\u201d Rebecca pointed out, \u201cDeter could have broken that glass if he really wanted to.\u201d\n\nI smiled, \u201cNice *observation* Rebecca!\u201d I jotted down the information: \u201cThey will not be able to break in, as long as you don\u2019t invite them.\u201d\n\nRebecca looked over the notepad, \u201cEverything else seemed okay upstairs. Oh! Wait, there\u2019s some banging in the closet, so do not open that.\u201d\n\n\u201cRule five: Do not open the closet, no matter what you hear,\u201d I smiled, \u201cNice! That\u2019s three for me, two for you. Honestly, I think that works in your favor for the fella\u2019s at the office.\u201d\n\n\u201cMmhmm,\u201d Rebecca said sarcastically, \u201cSo, should we get going?\u201d\n\n\u201cYep,\u201d I waved to Deter, \u201cSorry buddy, better luck next time\u2026\u201d I trailed off, \u201cOh, damn, guess there won\u2019t be a next time.\u201d\n\n\u201cDamn you!\u201d an inhuman voice shrieked as Deter\u2019s body was ripped back.\n\nI felt a shiver and an uneasiness fill my chest as I watched his once blue eyes become overcome with a black pitch.\n\nIt was as if I had stared into a void and it had stared back into my soul.\n\nRebecca snatched my notepad from me, ripping me out of my stupor, \u201cRule number six: Do not look into their eyes.\u201d\n\nI shivered, \u201cWell said, Rebecca.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet's get out of here. I\u2019m excited to end my final bit of field work,\u201d Rebecca announced as we headed out of the building.\n\nSo, if you ever do find yourself on 318 Dogwood Ave in Euclid, Ohio, remember the following rules:\n\n1. **Do NOT knock on the window if the light is on after 12:00 AM**\n2. **VERY IMPORTANT: Do NOT enter the woods at night, especially if you see lights**\n3. **Do not damage anything, or try to move or fix anything broken!**\n   1. **You\u2019ll be used to fix what is broken.**\n4. **Do NOT invite anyone in, even if you think you know them.**\n   1. **They will not be able to break in, as long as you don\u2019t invite them.**\n5. **Do NOT open the closets, no matter what you hear.**\n6. **Do NOT look into their eyes.**\n\nSo, using you folk as our QA Team\u2026.\n\n[How\u2019d we do?](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/The_Guardian_Temple\/)","1":"I'm sorry if this is all over the place. This all just happened today, and I can't stop my hands from shaking.\n\nI should start the story in 2018. My mother and father were set to go on a vacation to our cottage up north, when suddenly I get a frenzied phone call from my dad. He's saying that my mum was out at the car, packing the trunk for the trip, when suddenly a car stopped at the end of the driveway and a masked man dragged her into the backseat before speeding off. My father had seen it all from the living room window and had already called 911. \n\nAs soon as I got the call, I started the drive to my childhood home. It was about an hour away from my university, and by the time I arrived, the place was crawling with police. My dad ended up being taken to the police station to be interrogated. That's to be expected, the spouse is always the first suspect. The car was roped off, and the trunk was open with a suitcase thrown on the ground next to it. It really looked like my mum had been dragged away while packing the car for her trip. The sight of the suitcase on the ground made me collapse on the driveway in a fit of tears.\n\nMy parents lived on the outskirts of town, on a long rural road with maybe three other homes on it. It's woods all around the house, and the road is badly paved. Not a lot of people use the road because of this, but earlier that week there had been a break-in at one of the homes down the street. No one was hurt, but strangely instead of valuables being taken, it was reported that \"female undergarments\" were missing from the premises. After my father was cleared of any wrongdoing, there was suspicion that there may be some creep targeting remote homes in the area. But police couldn't find any clues besides that.\n\nFor years, my mother's case sat stagnant. She was eventually declared dead by the province, and we even threw a funeral for her. A funeral without a body. It felt like giving up on her, but my dad and I swore we'd never, EVER give up. \n\nMy dad was good friends with the police in town, due to his past job as a firefighter, and he constantly badgered them on leads in the case. But it really seemed like my mum just disappeared into thin air. It was so aggravating. \n\n2021 hit, and in July, my father fell ill. He was 67 and his reoccuring liver problems finally caught up to him. He died peacefully at the hospital, and I received everything. I have no siblings, so the car, house, and cottage all were left in my name.\n\nI'm 23, so the sudden amount of wealth I inherited was insane. I sold the cottage and quit my dead-end job to focus on fixing up my childhood home. I'm not planning on living here forever, just renovating it and selling it. I'm planning on moving into a bigger city with the money I make, and pursuing a career in art. I miss my father, and it feels like he left me the greatest gift possible.\n\nLiving as a 23 year old woman in a house in the woods, the house that my mother disappeared from with no trace, was terrifying, though. I live in Canada, so getting a gun for defense isn't really a thing here. After two weeks of sleepless nights and carrying a steak knife everywhere I went, I realised I needed protection.\n\nI mentioned my dad was friends with the police department in town, right? Well, the head detective of the cold cases unit still calls up the house every now and again. When my dad died, the police actually sent me a fruit basket. Super sweet stuff. So the lead detective called me to check up on me after I had moved into the house, and I mentioned how freaked out I was living in a forest house where there was an unsolved female disappearance. There hasn't been any crime in the area since my mother disappeared, but he said he understood why I'd be so afraid.\n\nHe then told me that the police agency was going to have some retired police dogs up for adoption soon. He told me that there would be several well-trained German Shepherds that would need homes, and if I wanted one, he could arrange for me to have first pick. I immediately agreed.\n\nThat's how I got Harley. She's 9 years old and a bit grey in areas, but immediately I felt safer with her around. She's super well-behaved, and though I didn't get much background on her when I adopted her, I assumed she must have been one of those big dogs that chased down criminals that were on the run. Seriously, she's a massive dog.\n\nFast forward to three weeks ago. This is where things go downhill. I've been using the downstairs area of the house since I inherited it, working on slowly updating the kitchen, bathroom, and living area. I've been sleeping on a mattress in the dining room, and barely ever go to the top two floors of the house. All of the doors upstairs are closed to preserve energy for heating\/cooling. I've gone upstairs maybe three or four times in the past month, just to look through old things or visit my old bedroom, but for the most part I stay downstairs to renovate and sleep.\n\nThree weeks ago, I went into my parents' old bedroom. I had remembered a big sweater my dad once had, and it was a cold night, and I wanted to see if I could find it to wear. I had been missing him and my mum a lot that night, so I spent quite a lot of time in their room just looking around. Finally I had found his sweater and turned to leave when I saw Harley was in the room.\n\nShe was sitting facing a bare wall, wagging her tail and looking at me intently.\n\nThe wall is opposite my parents' bed. It used to have a big water stain that my mum hated and my father always said he would fix, but always put it off. After my mum disappeared, he patched the wall up and told me that when mum returns, it would be like a little gift waiting for her.\n\nHarley would not stop looking from me, back to the wall, and then back to me. I called her over to the door and she didn't move. I grabbed her collar and tried to haul her over to hallway but it was like trying to move a statue. I was only able to get her out of the bedroom by emptying almost an entire box of Milk Bones onto the floor in the hallway. I quickly slammed the bedroom door behind her once she came over and thought that maybe she was getting a bit weird in old age.\n\nWell, since then, she scratched and whined at the bedroom door CONSTANTLY. If I gave in, she would go over to the wall and sit and stare at where my dad patched up the water stain. I once let her sit there and waited to see if eventually she'd get bored, but she stayed there for EIGHT HOURS without sleeping, eating, or anything. I seriously started to get super nervous about her. I took her to the vet even, but they found nothing wrong with her. I eventually ordered a baby gate from Amazon last week and set it up in the stairwell so she couldn't get to the bedroom door, but she just waited at the gate all day.\n\nCut to today. I'm in town buying groceries, and I see the head detective from the cold cases unit in the produce section. He and I chat a bit, and he asks about Harley. I tell him she's a great dog, but sometimes she acts a bit weird. He asks if I think it's just doggie old age, and I jokingly tell him that maybe all those years of chasing people down has given her doggie-PTSD.\n\nHe laughs and says something along the lines of, \"Oh, she wasn't that kind of police dog. Didn't you know? She's a cadaver dog. She sniffed out dead bodies.\"\n\nMy blood ran cold. Without trying to sound suspicious, I asked him what that entails. He told me that Harley is trained in finding bodies through scent, and that she signals when she smells even the faintest trace of a corpse. \n\n\"I believe her indication signal was sitting down at the area of the corpse smell.\"\n\nAt this point, I was seeing stars. I quickly excused myself with some bullshit excuse of needing to go make dinner, even though it was only 2 in the afternoon. I bought my groceries and drove home and it all felt like a dream.\n\nOnce I got home, I didn't even bother bringing my groceries in. I ran inside, opened the baby gate, charged upstairs, and threw open my parents' door. Harley rushed in after me.\n\nShe sat straight in front of the patched wall and looked at me, her tail wagging.\n\nThe wall my dad patched up after my mother went missing.\n\nI'm sitting in my living room right now, typing this all out. My dad was the nicest man I'd ever met. He never would have hurt a fly. He was cleared by the police department in my mum's disappearance! I do not believe he killed her, but Harley is still upstairs signaling at the wall he repaired. She won't budge.\n\nI'm planning on using my dad's old tools and cutting into the wall tomorrow. I'm too shaky to do it tonight. I'm hoping to just see a dead mouse? Maybe something that got trapped in the wall and is making Harley signal? Besides, wouldn't the scent of a full human corpse be noticeable to a human nose too? This just doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm going to try and get some sleep. I hope all I find tomorrow is an empty wall, or maybe a dead squirrel. Wish me luck.","2":"Hello.\n\nI've never talked about my personal experiences before. Especially ones like this. Please bear with me if things aren't explained... well, I guess.\n\nIt happened, I think, a month ago. Ants were infesting my room, coming from a specific wall that lead to the outside. So, because of this, I rearranged my room in a strange fashion. But it worked for me, and it was only supposed to be temporary.\n\nMy room is large, and wooden. It sits second story, with only two walls leading to the outside. Originally, my bed was facing outwards below a window. But, as said prior, I moved it because of the ants. Its new position, is in the exact middle of the room. I know, it's kind of... unorthodox. I could have just moved it to the walls that *don't* go to the outside. But I was afraid of them coming through there, too, somehow. I became a bit paranoid, even though there wasn't a need for it. But whatever.\n\nSo my bed now sits in the middle of the room, with my bookcase right behind it. And this bookcase (or, some refer to them as \"cubicles\") is loosely filled with books, knick-knacks, and other things. But you can see through it to the other side, from both sides.\n\nThis is where the issue lies.\n\nI honestly didn't think much of it, it didn't seem like a problem to me when I first put it there. I couldn't have expected what happened.\n\nThe first night was fine. I slept well. But as the nights started to go, I got less and less sleep. This effected my days and made it really hard to do simple tasks like chores and homework. And it's not like something specific was keeping me up. I just... couldn't sleep. I was tossing and turning all night, and it was miserable.\n\nAfter exactly nine nights, on the tenth night, is when it first happened.\n\nI'd been tossing and turning, like I normally did. It was probably somewhere around 4:00 AM at the time, determining by the hand on the clock that I could barely see from my bed. It was near fucking pitch black in my room. No night lights or anything, because I wouldn't have normally been afraid of the dark. I heard a... shuffling? sound from behind my bed. Like something was moving my books very slowly, and very silently. At this point my eyes shot open, and... you know that feeling of absolute terror when you think you hear something when nothing is supposed to be making any noise? That was happening. I could feel every fucking strand of hair on me stick up. Because no one else was in my room. We didn't have rats or mice and I definitely didn't let one of the animals in here.\n\nFor the first few seconds, I didn't move. I was terrified, but I thought that maybe I was hearing things. It was 4:00 AM after all, and no sleep can sometimes make you hear or see things. At least, that's what I thought in the moment. I didn't know how sound that logic was, but I was fucking praying it was right.\n\nIt didn't stop. But I didn't move. Not until it had been at least two minutes of something moving my things around. My breathing was starting to make too much noise, and when I let out a winded shaky breath, the... something... stopped. I immediately shot my head up, my entire body in fight or flight. I bolted to my door, opened it and fucking booked it out of my room.\n\nI didn't hear or see anything on my way out, and I didn't want to. I woke my mom up and told her about it. She reminded me of the time, in our old house, how I would hear a clicking sound sometimes at night. I tried to tell her this wasn't like this, but she didn't believe me. I mean, I don't believe in ghosts. But I had no idea what the fuck else this could have been.\n\nEven though my mom let me sleep beside her, I didn't get much sleep that night. I was just staring at the space next to the bed. I was sweating so badly my hair was actually drenched. I'd never experienced something this terrifying before.\n\nSomething so... unbelievable.\n\nThe next night, I didn't turn my light off. It gave me a bit of comfort, but I kept checking behind the bookshelf to make sure nothing was there, and I definitely couldn't sleep. I was sweating again, and in hindsight I probably should've just stayed in my mom's room or pulled an all nighter. But by that time, I had kind of figured my brain was playing tricks on me. It was just too... unrealistic.\n\nBut it fucking happened again.\n\nAnd this time, it was worse. I didn't think it could get worse.\n\nI swear I was about to fall asleep. I could feel myself becoming that kind of weird delusional you get before you sleep, where you just think of jumbled shit (maybe that's just me). My eyes kept shutting and I felt really weak.\n\nUntil the light went off.\n\nIn a fucking instant my entire mind was on fire, and I was fully awake. Before I could even get up, I heard the shuffling start again. This time a bit faster, the movements... quicker. I didn't wait to listen further, though. I was on my feet. Taking a single glimpse to the bookshelf, I saw something that will never leave my fucking mind.\n\nBehind the bookshelf, was... something, hunched over. I saw a hand that was discolored, with long claws on the side of the bookshelf. I couldn't make out a face, or even where it was, but it wasn't human. And it was no creature I'd ever seen.\n\nNeedless to say I got the fuck out of there. My body was filled with so much adrenaline I almost stumbled over my own feet while running out of the room. I screamed to my mom as I ran down the stairs. I told her what I saw and that I didn't want to go check. But I didn't want her to go on her own. So together, we got kitchen knives and flashlights. I still mostly stuck behind her.\n\nWhen we got back to the room, the door was closed and I could see the light on inside. When we entered, nothing was there. Nothing in the room had been changed. No books moved, no knick-knacks shifted from their usual spots. No... creature. Even the fucking lights were back on, door closed, like I'd never even left the room.\n\nBut I know I saw something. My brain wasn't playing tricks on me. This was all too real.\n\nI never slept in that room again, and I absolutely refused to go back in, even during the daytime, without someone right next to me. After a few sleepless nights in my mom's room, we ended up moving out. And so far, in my new home, everything is perfectly fine.\n\nI don't know what that was back there. I don't know why it came there, suddenly, after I moved my bed. But there was certainly **something**. And I'll never forget it.","3":"Elvis dove beneath the altar as the keyboardist\u2019s lit cigarette dropped out of her mouth. I don\u2019t think either of them had ever seen a Were-bat before.\n\nMy soon-to-be mother-in-law, Agatha, circled above our heads, periodically swooping down to attack. There wasn\u2019t much Alex or I could do besides windmill our crucifixes.\n\nThe keyboardist made a desperate, foolish break for the exit. But before she\u2019d even made it halfway, Agatha nosedived and sunk her claws so deep into the lady\u2019s shoulders the ends disappeared, then carried her, kicking and screaming, through the shattered window.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d I shouted at Elvis, who was holding his knees against his chest. \u201cFinish the ceremony.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you fucking nuts?\u201d he replied, his voice shrill and distinctly un-Elvis-like. He whipped his gaze between me and Alex. \u201cWhat the fuck was that thing?\u201d\n\nAlex said, \u201cThat\u2019s my mom, and I guarantee you she\u2019s coming right back unless you\u2014\u201d\n\nAgatha glided back into the room and dived for us. At the very last second, Alex\u2019s crucifix went up in a shining arc and her mom veered off course. She spun onto the floor, crashed through several rows of wooden benches, and finally collided with the far wall.\n\n\u201cThat won\u2019t keep her down for long,\u201d I said. Elvis swallowed a lump then pulled himself up using the altar.\n\n\"A-A-Alex repeat after me, I, Alex, take thee, J-Jason, to be my lawfully wedded husband.\u201d He spoke fast, barely leaving enough time for her to repeat the vows.\n\n\u201cTo have and to hold from\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014this day forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn sickness and in\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014and in health.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo love and to cherish.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014ove and to cherish.\u201d\n\n\u201cTill death do us part.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014death do us part.\u201d\n\nHe took a deep breath and closed his eyes. \u201cThen by the authority vested in me\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI OBJECT,\u201d said a hoarse voice. \n\nAcross the room, Agatha\u2019s bat wings morphed into a black robe while her claws transformed into arthritic hands. With a simple flick of her wrist, she made the benches slide part like the dead sea did for Moses. The temperature plummeted twenty degrees, or maybe I just imagined it had.\n\nI grabbed Elvis by the popped collar and said, \u201cFINISH IT.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rings,\u201d he stammered.\n\nI fumbled through my pockets until I found the ring box and offered it up.\n\nA panic-stricken Elvis frantically gestured towards Alex. She extended her right hand whilst still holding the crucifix with her left. With a little jiggling, I got the ring on her finger and said, \u201cI give this as a sign of our everlasting love, yadda-yadda-yadda.\u201d\n\nAgatha raised her arms. Plaster and dust cascaded off the ceiling as a fierce gust of wind forced us to huddle around the altar.\n\nAlex grabbed the other ring and slipped it on my finger, quickly repeated the line, then we both looked at Elvis.\n\n\u201cThen by the power vested in me\u2014\u201d\n\nWith a simple pinching motion, the old witch made Elvis\u2019s mouth clamp shut, then the crucifixes suddenly flew out of our hands, leaving us vulnerable and exposed.\n\nThe horrible crow beckoned her daughter towards her. Gliding as if on ice, Alex was drawn straight into her mother\u2019s wicked clutches, then she made Alex fall into an immediate trance with a prod to the forehead.\n\nWhile Elvis thrashed around unable to pry his lips apart, I charged. Agatha mumbled a spell which made my legs become limper than wet noodles, sending me tumbling onto the floor.\n\nThere was nothing I could do\u2014she was too powerful.\n\nCombining more Latin with grand sweeping gestures, she made the entire chapel quake. Light fixtures exploded around the room; framed pictures of Elvis danced on the walls.\n\nThe stink of fire and brimstone engulfed my nostrils. And then, just a few feet before the altar, floorboards ripped open, exposing a deep pit at a forty-five-degree angle.\n\nOn the opposite side, far beneath the space where the floor had once been, there was an ocean of fire, radiating an intense orange glow. And in the midst of it stood a titanic creature silhouetted behind flames. Judging from the outline, it appeared to have long, curved horns and the torso of a man. \n\nIt was Alex\u2019s husband-to-be: Prince Beelzebub.\n\nInch by inch, I crawled forward on my elbows until I was close enough to grab Agatha\u2019s robe. \u201cNo,\u201d I muttered, feebly. \u201cPlease stop.\u201d\n\nShe shot me a look of disdain, bent over, clamped an icy hand around my neck, and hoisted me into the air. \u201cDo you have any idea what you almost cost me?\u201d The tendons in her neck looked ready to explode. \u201cIf you\u2019d made me break my oath, I\u2019d be facing an eternity of pain.\u201d \n\nHer soulless eyes glittered orange against the fiery ocean. \u201cThe second this is done you\u2019re coming with me. You\u2019ll be my new plaything.\u201d She pulled me so close I could taste the stench of disease and death wafting out of her mouth. \u201cI can hardly wait. We\u2019re going to have such fun together. I\u2019ve got\u2026oh, so many things to teach you.\u201d\n\nMy guts clenched.\n\nBeelzebub reached through the pit towards our world, eager to collect what was promised.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t\u2026.do this\u2026to Alex.\u201d I rasped. \n\nAgatha\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cOh? And why not?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026love her.\u201d\n\nHer mouth twisted into a grotesque little smirk. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nBeside us, Alex\u2019s head was stooped against her chest, her glazed eyes the color of egg whites, her face expressionless. As I stared at the woman I loved, my thoughts steered back to that night seven years ago, to the first time we met. Since then, she\u2019d changed my life in more ways than she could possibly imagine. I needed her like I needed oxygen.\n\nThe thought of abandoning her to the underworld was unacceptable.\n\nIt took all of my focus and concentration just to raise my right arm. Then, with the little strength I had left, I clenched my fist and struck Agatha\u2019s forehead.\n\nShe cackled, but only for a split second, because now there was a cross indented between her eyes.\n\nShe looked at me, looked at the ring, then back to me. The realization hit her like a lightning bolt. \n\nNot only was my ring made from pure silver, but it also had a crucifix etched into the top. I had a double whammy of witch-slaying power wrapped around my finger\u2014a stroke of pure genius from my wonderful bride-to-be.\n\nAs Agatha\u2019s grip slackened, I took a deep breath and then struck her again, on the chin this time. Her jawbone popped open like a bin lid, remaining attached to only one side of her skull.\n\nA mammoth hand, at least double the size of my Saturn Coupe, pushed through the pit and almost broke through the ceiling, eclipsing the entire room with its wide shadow. \n\nI struck Agatha again. This time a vertical slit opened, spanning from the crown of her skull to the bridge of her nose. She released my neck and hissed like a cat with a trampled tail. And then, with great satisfaction, I found my feet, took a step back, then spartan kicked her into the pit.\n\nWho hasn\u2019t dreamed of doing that to their mother-in-law? \n\nThe second Agatha vanished Elvis made a loud gasp. Alex gasped too, as if waking from a terrible nightmare, moments before a colossal thumb and forefinger pinched her ankles together and dragged her in the direction of the pit.\n\nI lunged forward, grabbed her hands, and then we were both getting reeled into the underworld.\n\n\u201cFINISH THE CEREMONY,\u201d I screamed at Elvis, who was busy hyperventilating.\n\nHalfway to hell, Agatha clung to a jagged rock, desperately rasping, \u201cNOOOOO!\u201d\n\nFrom behind me, Elvis screamed, \u201cSAY I DO, SAY I DO!\u201d\n\n\u201cI do!\u201d I shouted.\n\n\u201cI do too!\u201d Alex added. \n\nWithout pausing for a single breath, Elvis said, \u201cThen-by-the-authority-vested-in-me-by-the-state-of-Nevada-I-now-pronounce-you-mister-and-missus-Jason-Cheeseman-you-may-kiss-the-bride.\u201d\n\nWe kissed. And for one very special moment, the world melted away. I forget about witches, I forget about demons, and I forgot about Elvis-fucking-Presley.\n\nBeelzebub immediately released Alex. With her now officially married, the deal was void, and he had no use for her. Instead, he settled on a new target: Agatha.\n\nI heaved Alex out of the pit, clear of danger.\n\nAgatha, knowing what was about to happen, tried to transform into a Werebat and fly up, but she was too slow. Beelzebub caught her, and then all I could see was a withered head poking out of a closed fist. Through her badly concaved mouth, Agatha spat sparks and flames as she was dragged to Hell.\n\nAs the pit sealed itself up, Alex and I stepped away, clear of any danger. The sound of Agatha\u2019s screams echoed around the chapel. The room trembled violently as the floorboards stitched themselves back together, and then it was over. The pit was gone.\n\nI kissed my wife. It felt so good to say that: *my wife*. Time moved dreamlike. We kissed again, and again and again, and again and again, then six more times.\n\nI twirled her around laughing, crying, savoring the moment, never wanting it to end.\n\nEventually, I peeled my eyes of the most beautiful bride in the world to thank Elvis for all his help.\n\nBut the king had left the building.\n\nBeyond the shattered window, our keyboardist groaned and rubbed her punctured shoulder, then casually lit another cigarette. \n\nAlex nested her head against my chest and sighed deeply. The nightmare was finally over, and we were free\u2014free to spend the rest of our lives together.\n\nCaressing her soft cheek, I let out an exhausted sigh and said, [\u201cSo...where should we go for the honeymoon?\u201d](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/thoughtindustry\/)","4":"The morning after I brought mom's ashes back from the funeral home, somebody opened them.\n\nI went out to the living room and found the cardboard box was no longer on the mantelpiece. Somebody had moved it to the coffee table. The plastic bag inside had been ripped open, exposing the ashes to the air. It made me think of how my wife always opens bags of chips or cereal and shoves him back into the pantry without closing them all away; it drives me nuts.\n\nI went back to the bedroom. My wife was still in bed. I asked her why she opened the ashes. I guess I sounded a little accusatory. My wife got mad.\n\nShe said she didn't know what I was talking about. I brought her out to the living room and showed her the open box of ashes.\n\n\"Why would I do that?\"\n\nI didn't know.\n\nShe asked, \"It wasn't you?\"\n\nIt was not.\n\nMy wife was afraid. She wanted me to check the footage on the ring security camera on the front door.\n\n\"If it wasn't me and it wasn't you, then it was somebody else,\" she said. Couldn't argue with that.\n\nI looked through the security footage of the front doorstep. I scrolled through the entire night. Some cars drove by. That was it.\n\nI looked at the ashes. There was a little crater in the mound of ashes like some had been scooped out. It was hard to say if any were actually missing. Still, if somebody had gone to the trouble of opening the box, it stood to reason that they'd taken some ashes out.\n\nLater, I borrowed my wife's postage scale. She saw me with it and asked what I was using it for. I pretended not to hear her.\n\nI weighed my mother's ashes. 135.2 ounces. That's over 8 pounds. I looked it up online. That's pretty heavy for ashes. I was surprised. Mom didn't weigh that much; sure, she was pretty heavy by the end. Her legs were swollen with retained water and sprouting wounds that wouldn't heal, filled with puss and swampy scabs that I had to clean with iodine every few days until the hospice nurse took over.\n\nBut even with all the retained water, she never went over 150 pounds. According to what I found on Google, only large men will turn into more than 7 pounds of ashes.\n\nI called the funeral home. I asked the guy how much my mother's ashes weighed when I'd picked them up. He asked why I wanted to know. I said I just wanted to know. The guy said they didn't keep track of that information.\n\n\"Is there a problem with the remains?\" the guy asked. He sounded genuinely concerned but I didn't feel like getting into it.\n\nAfter I hung up, I decided to move the 135.2 ounces of ashes out of the living room and into the bedroom closet for safekeeping.\n\nMy wife didn't like that. I wasn't crazy about it either but I wanted the ashes to be somewhere I could keep an eye on them.\n\nBefore we went to bed that night, I checked the locks on all the windows and doors. Then I set up a video camera app on my tablet and propped up the tablet in the hallway to record the entrance to the bedroom door. So if somebody broke in, they'd show up on one of the cameras. \n\n\"Or they're going to steal your iPad,\" my wife said. She had a point, so I hid the tablet in a bucket of laundry.\n\n\"It's not going to matter if he's on camera if he kills us in our sleep,\" my wife said.\n\nI said that if we were murdered in our sleep, at least there would be footage of the killer. That would help the police catch the murderer.\n\n\"At least our deaths will mean something,\" I said.\n\nI was trying to be funny. I also meant it. \n\nI had been thinking a lot about death and what it all means. When my mom died, I thought about her life. My mom had got an education, a job, a husband, a kid, a divorce, cancer, and finally a cardboard box. Now here I was, her legacy. And what was I doing? I was setting up tablets to try to get footage of an ashes pervert. What was I doing for the world? What was it all for? I wanted it to mean something.\n\nAnyway, my wife didn't laugh.\n\nThe next morning, we woke up to find my mom's ashes were not in the closet where I'd put them. They were sitting on the dresser. The box was open. The ashes pervert had struck again.\n\nI weighed the ashes. 105.8 ounces. Almost 20 ounces of mom gone.\n\nMy wife called the police. I checked the footage on the ring light and on my tablet. There was nothing.\n\nEither the ashes-molester was coming in through the bedroom window without waking us or my wife was the culprit.\n\nI searched the bedroom for traces of the missing ashes. There was no bathroom attached to the bedroom and my wife hadn't shown up on the video camera in the hallway at night. So if it was my wife, the ashes had to be in the room somewhere. Or maybe outside the window. But they weren't.\n\nI went to the living room. My wife was talking to the cops on the phone. I looked at her fingernails, looking for hints of ashes. Nothing. She seemed more scared than I was. I didn't think she had anything to do with it. But my wife was an emotional person, so you never know.\n\nThe police said it was weird. It didn't seem like they were going to do anything about it. I don't know what they could've done. They advised us to make sure that everything was locked and to keep the ashes out of the house.\n\nMy wife was still pretty freaked out by the time she got off the phone with the cops. I suggested that we just scatter mom's ashes early.\n\n\"You shouldn't have to do that,\" she said. The plan had been to scatter the ashes at the end of the week with the rest of my mom's family. They were coming from out of town. That was the plan.\n\nSo that night, I put mom's ashes in the trunk of my car parked in the driveway.\n\nStanding near the driveway, I put the box of ashes in the trunk. I looked at it.\n\nThe edge of the tape holding the box together had peeled away in one place. Hair and lint and crumbs were stuck to the sticky side of the tape. The box sat next to a folded lawn chair and a bunch of empty paper grocery bags and jumper cables.\n\nIt didn't seem right to leave mom in the trunk like that, so I decided to upgrade her to the passenger seat.\n\nThen, on a whim, I set up my tablet-camera inside the car, pointing it at the box. If somebody was cruising around the neighborhood looking for stuff to steal, my car would be easy pickings. But I wanted to know who was coming after my mom.\n\nThe next morning, I went out there. The windows weren't broken. The car was still locked. So far, so good. But then I got closer and guess what: the box of ashes sitting on the passenger seat was torn open again.\n\nEven more ashes were missing. It's like somebody had taken an ice cream scoop and loaded up a triple-decker cone.\n\nI grabbed my tablet and went back inside. In the kitchen, my wife asked about the status. I told her it was fine. I didn't want to worry her.\n\nOnce I was alone, I looked through the footage on the tablet. I wasn't expecting to see anything. I was starting to feel like my mother was climbing out of the box herself and that something like that couldn't be caught on footage because the universe wouldn't allow such craziness to be documented.\n\nBut I found something on the video.\n\nFor several hours there was nothing but darkness for hours. Then, in the middle of the night, the car beeped and flashed.\n\nThe passenger seat door opened. The car light turned on.\n\nIt was me.\n\nI didn't look like I was sleepwalking or possessed or anything. It just looked like me. I picked up the box of ashes--in the video, I mean--and I peeled off the tape.\n\nI watched myself open the plastic bag and scoop out some ashes and put them in my mouth.\n\nI ate the ashes. I put my fingers in, got a scoop, and then dribbled them into my mouth. It's like I was going for a midnight snack of crumbs at the bottom of a bag of pretzels.\n\nAfter almost 10 minutes of ash-eating, I watched myself close the car door and go back inside. I left the ashes right where they were on the seat. The video went black again when the car light shut off.\n\nI turned off the video. I sat and thought about things.\n\nI thought about how my mother came out of my grandmother's body. Women are born with all their eggs already in them. That's not 100% true but it's mostly true. So, most of me was inside my mother when she was inside my grandmother. My grandmother was my first home. My mother was my room. When my grandmother died, the place my mom vanished. Now my mom had vanished too. The place that I was from was turned to dust. And I was slowly eating the remains. Bringing that lost home back into myself. Maybe that's what my sleepwalking-self wanted. To bring my mother back into me. I don't know.\n\nI didn't know how to explain this to my wife either. How was I supposed to protect the ashes from myself? Did I even want to?\n\nMy grandmother--my mom's mom--was not cremated. Her second husband was a very buttoned-up Catholic who had certain ways of doing things. When my grandmother died, she was buried in an expensive coffin in an expensive plot of land. There was a white cross marking her grave. At her service, there was a priest quoting the Bible. The kind of funeral that you see in the movies. The whole thing cost more than a year of college tuition. Mom hated the whole deal.\n\nAfter my grandmother's funeral, I asked my mom what she wanted me to do with her body when she was gone.\n\nShe said, \"I don't care, do whatever makes you happy.\" I told her that doing things to her corpse wouldn't make me happy. So she said, \"Cremate me and scatter me in the ocean.\" \n\nBut before she had said to scatter her in the ocean, she had said to do whatever would make me happy. That's what she'd said.\n\nWould it make me feel better to eat her?\n\nI don't believe in accidents. I think at some level, we mean to do what we do. Even when we're drunk or sleepwalking or whatever. We may not choose to do everything we do, but we choose the situations in which we do them, if you see what I mean.\n\nIf I was eating mom's ashes at night, then some part of me wanted to do exactly that. To do the opposite of let her go. To bring her in.\n\nThe more I thought about eating the ashes, the more it sounded like a good idea. It was crazy, but I started thinking I owed it to myself to try. Some part of me wanted to eat them: there was video evidence of that. And I had eaten some already. What was the harm in a little more?\n\nI opened the box. Grabbed a handful. Started to eat.\n\nIt did not taste good. But it felt good.\n\nAs I felt the gritty and flaky substance dissolving between my teeth, I kept thinking to myself, \"This is the womb I was made in. This is where I'm from. I am inside myself now.\"\n\nI kept having thoughts like that. It felt meaningful to me, but I couldn't tell you what it meant. What does any of it mean? We're pretentious apes who like to kill ourselves with guns and fast food. We make noise at each other's graduations and leak saltwater at each other's funerals. And then we are dead. What the hell does it matter if I eat my mom if that's what I feel like doing?\n\nIdeas like that kept coming to me. In between mouthfuls of ashes, I started to write ideas down. I started feeling like I was really onto something. Maybe I could help other people. I could form a religion. Or a self-help website. Maybe I had discovered a new way to grieve. You had to eat the remains. You had to bring the loss inside of you. That was it. I had found the answer. It sounds crazy but that's what I was thinking.\n\nThe ashes were half gone by the time I started feeling sick to my stomach.\n\nI stopped eating. I looked at what I'd been writing on my computer. By the harsh light of my stomachache, it all looked nutty. I didn't know what was going on with me.\n\nI felt ashamed looking at the box of half-empty ashes. It's like when I first tried to quit smoking. Every couple of months, I would buy a pack and chain smoke half of them until I got ashamed and then I'd toss them out. \n\nI tried to forget what I'd done. I closed up mom's ashes. I made myself do some work on my computer but it was hard to focus. I found myself wanting to watch the video again. So that's what I did.\n\nI watched it again. I watched myself eating the ashes. Again. And again.\n\n\"What the hell is that?\"\n\nMy wife had come into the room without me noticing. She looked at the video footage on the screen. She looked at the box of ashes, half-empty.\n\nThere was nothing else for it. I explained everything that I could explain and tried to explain some of what I couldn't as well. My wife listened. She was worried about me. I could tell from the way she was looking at me. While I was talking, I started to cry for some reason. I hadn't cried for a long time.\n\nThat's when my phone rang. \n\nIt was the funeral home. The guy sounded nervous. \n\n\"You called yesterday, asking about the weight of your mother's ashes,\" he said.\n\nI agreed.\n\nHe asked, \"Have you buried or scattered the remains?\"\n\nI said I hadn't. It was true.\n\n\"Excellent,\" he said, suddenly relieved. \"I don't know how to say this, but you received the wrong remains.\"\n\nI didn't understand. I put it on speakerphone so that my wife could hear.\n\n\"You were given the wrong box. There was a mistake. Very sorry about this. But can you please bring back the remains? And we can give you the correct remains.\"\n\nI asked whose ashes it was that I got. \n\n\"Somebody else's,\" he said. \"Can you come today?\"\n\nAfter I got off the phone, my wife said, \"We've got to fill it back up.\" She's emotional but sometimes she can be very practical.\n\nWe took some of the ashes from the barbecue in the backyard and mixed them back into the ash bag until it weighed 135.2 ounces again. Then I added a little more to top it off and I shook it all around in the bag to blend them together. It didn't look perfect but it would have to do. \n\nAt the funeral home, the very first thing the funeral guy did was weigh the box. So I knew they must keep track of the weight after all.\n\nI was hoping I got the weight right. Must've been good enough because the funeral guy didn't say anything. He just apologized a lot. He gave us my mom's ashes. \n\n\"We would like to offer you something to make up for it,\" he said.\n\nI suggested that we could get the next one on the house.\n\nMy wife didn't laugh and the guy didn't either, but he smiled politely. He looked like he hadn't been getting much sleep. In the end, he ended up giving me a $400 urn to put mom in.\n\nWhen we got home, I put the urn on the dresser. \"Are we still going to scatter her this weekend?\" my wife asked.\n\nI said I didn't know. My wife didn't follow-up. We hadn't really talked about the video or why I had been sleepwalking and eating ashes. We had tried but it was too weird so we just tried not to think about it. \n\nThat night, we went to bed feeling like it was all over.\n\nI dreamt that my mother came to me.\n\nShe came into the bedroom. I was lying in bed next to my sleeping wife and mom just appeared right there at the door. She wasn't a ghost. She wasn't transparent or gliding or anything like that. She just walked in the way that she would back when walking was easy and she didn't have to stumble around with a cane on her swollen legs.\n\nShe came in and sat at my bedside and said, \"I'm not her.\"\n\nShe touched my bare leg. When she did, my leg turned to ash.\n\nDream-paralyzed, I watched her reach into the ashes of my limb, scoop up a handful of leg-ashes, and shove them into her mouth. But it wasn't her mouth anymore. It belonged to someone else. Something else. Big teeth. Scabbed lips. Burnt tongue.\n\nI didn't get too good of a look at it because right about then I woke up screaming.\n\nMy wife flicked on the light. I kept screaming. She looked at me and looked at my leg and she started screaming too.\n\nMy leg was gone, chewed off below the knee, the sheets soaked through with blood.\n\nThat's how I ended up here at the hospital.\n\nThe doctor says it looks like an animal chewed my leg off. She doesn't understand how this could've happened in my bedroom. I tried to explain about the dream and the ashes. They think I'm crazy. I can't blame them. I showed them the video, but that doesn't prove anything except that I'm a freak who eats ashes.\n\nIt's morning now. I'm going to be here for a few days. They need to do another procedure to clean off dead tissue from my stump. Further down the line, I've got to get fitted for a prosthetic. \n\nWho knows if I'll make it that far, though. \n\nWhat if it comes back for the rest of me? I ate those ashes for three nights. It's only got one on me.\n\nThe funeral home won't pick up the phone. My wife is going over there right now. Hopefully, she gets some straight answers from the funeral guy. Hopefully, the thing won't come back. I wonder who took home my mother's ashes. I wonder where my leg is. I wonder if tomorrow I'll be missing another one.\n\nIf I don't make it through the night, at least my story is out there. Hopefully, this will help somebody in case it happens to them. Hopefully, all this will mean something.","5":"\n\nI had just sat down for my ride home on the late charter bus when I felt something odd under my seat. It was like sitting on a lump, it wasn\u2019t too big but it was definitely uncomfortable. \n\nInstinctively I reached under to try and remove the object and my hand touched something familiar. The small size and glint of plastic told me it was a smart phone but not a brand I was familiar with. \n\n*someone must have left it here by accident* I thought to myself. \n\nSince I had a little time until my stop I unzipped my backpack and took out my portable charger. As luck would have it, the plug fit and immediately the phone began to charge. \n\nI watched it the way you might a kettle, waiting for it to boil. I don\u2019t know why. I didn\u2019t really expect to be able to unlock it, but part of me was hopeful there wasn\u2019t a passcode. \n\nFive minutes later, it powered up and made a grinding noise like an old modem would. I grabbed it up and waited to see what secrets were within. \n\n\nThe screen was completely black, no background at all; and the time was definitely off as though it hadn\u2019t been updated in some time. Even the year was wrong. \n\nHow long had it been here? \n\nThere was no reception and it didn\u2019t look like I could unlock it so I just set it back down and focused on my own phone. \n\nThen I heard the distinct sound of a text message notification. \n\nComing from the older phone\u2026? \n\nBut that shouldn\u2019t have been possible I thought as I picked it back up and saw in short succession there were dozens of messages. All from the same person apparently. \n\nImmediately I did my best to read them in rapid response. \n\n\n>Where are you?\n\n>Why aren\u2019t you responding?\n\n>Is everything okay? \n\n>Don\u2019t go through with it. \n\nThat message stuck out to me as I kept reading and scrolling toward the beginning of the story, to try and figure out exactly what was going on. \n\n>Hey, glad we could finally exchange numbers. Call me anytime! Anna. \n\n>Thanks for actually responding. I was beginning to think that no one actually saw me these days. Craig. \n\nAnna and Craig. These two sounded like lovers and I was about to get all the juicy details of their relationship I thought. \nThis must have been Craig\u2019s phone. And he kept everything about Anna on here. \n\nI saw that he had no other contacts in his phone, which was a little strange. \n\nNext I decided to check pictures. \n\nThere were several taken at strange angles, all on the same day of the same person. \n\nIt looked like he had taken the photographs on his phone right here on this bus. \n\nDid he frequently travel this route too?\n\nIt felt strange to imagine sitting where someone else had and knowing exactly what it was they had been doing. \n\n\nInstinctively I glanced up to see if maybe the woman in the pictures was on the bus today. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how freaked out I would have been if that had been the case but I breathed a sigh of relief when I realized besides myself and a few other riders, the bus was empty. And none of them resembled the woman in the pictures. \n\n\nAs I scrolled back in time on his phone I saw that he took at least a hundred pictures of her, maybe more. This was bordering on obsession. \n\nAnd then I saw in his notes things that he said about how he felt about her. \n\nEven before they actually exchanged numbers. \n\nThis is what the phone\u2019s notes said: \n\n_________\n\n\nI saw a woman on the bus today, something about her stood out as different than any other I have seen before. \n\nHave you ever heard of soulmates? I guess I got a funny feeling when I saw her and I\u2019m wondering if maybe it\u2019s that. She\u2019s very beautiful, so much so that I doubt she would want to be with anyone like me. \n\nI know that you would say I should take a leap of faith, but look where that got me. What if she rejects me? Or worse, decides to not respond. \n\n_______\n\nI paused there in the notes wondering who it was that Craig seemed to have faith in. There was scarce else to find on the phone. It was too old for there to be social media or anything like that and besides the myriad photos of the woman the only thing I hadn\u2019t really checked was his call log. \n\nOf course the thought of it made me feel like I was already invading this stranger\u2019s privacy too much. But something about this conversation was intriguing. I needed to know what had happened. \n\nI pulled up recent calls and saw that the same number had tried to call him over and over. \n\nThen it finally hit me how long this phone had apparently been sitting here. \n\nSix years. It seemed impossible. But what happened next was even more so. \n\nThe phone let out a ping again. A new message? How could that be? \n\nI slowly reached for it. \n\n\nUNKNOWN \n\n*Do you think you know me?*\n\nAgain I felt uneasy even reading the message, or daring to respond. It was a private number so I figured that it was pointless to do so and I immediately put the phone down, trying to ignore the next message coming in. \n\n*Maybe you should keep reading. See what happened with Anna.*\n\nI went back to the text messages. My eyes nervously scanning the bus. Was Craig on the bus watching me? \n\nThe notes continued: \n\n*I finally worked up the nerve to get her to notice me. We hit it off immediately! I\u2019m so excited. We exchanged numbers. This is exactly the lucky break I have been looking for. At last patience has paid off. *\n\nThe text messages also seemed to show a story of a despairing man that didn\u2019t get recognized for anything. \n\n>Hey Craig are you doing okay? I wanted to invite you to drinks but I wasn\u2019t sure if you had the time. \n\nI appreciate it, Anna but I really can\u2019t go. I have a lot of work to catch up on. \n\nBut his notes told a different story. \n\n*How I wish that I could have a life with her. The things we could do together. But that isn\u2019t how it\u2019s meant to be. She won\u2019t understand the things I have to do. You would understand of course. You always knew what I was capable of.* \n\nWhat exactly was Craig planning? \n\nAnother message chimed in from UNKNOWN. \n\n*Please tell me you have seen where this is headed. I can see the worry on your face. You think I hurt her. *\n\nThis time I decided to respond. \n\nIf you didn\u2019t hurt her then why are all these text messages sound so obsessed with her? And the pictures? You were stalking this woman! And if I didn\u2019t know any better I would think you are stalking me! \n\n*Don\u2019t be ridiculous. You are nothing like her. True you will be just as interesting to follow and watch but Anna was special. She really wanted to help me. *\n\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d I dared to ask. I knew there was no way this old phone should have been working or providing messages without service. But the texts had already convinced me this was not an ordinary conversation. Something beyond the realm of my world view that was now creeping to the forefront. \n\nI went back to the text messages. The more I read the more disturbed I was by Craig. \n\n>I\u2019m worried about you Craig. I always see you sitting alone on this bus. If it wasn\u2019t for that phone I would think you were dead. \n\n>You don\u2019t need to worry. I\u2019m fine. But I appreciate the concern. It\u2019s been a long time since anyone really worried about me. \n\n>You promise me that you are okay?\n\n>Of course. I will be fine now that you are with me. \n\n>The only time I\u2019m with you is when we travel on this bus together! Why don\u2019t you ever want to come with me?\n\n>I told you before that I can\u2019t. Why don\u2019t you just leave it alone?\n\n>I'm starting to think you are trapped on this bus. \n\n>If that were true my only concern would be to get out of here. I wouldn\u2019t be wasting my time getting to know you. \n\nA few more days of messages like that scrolled by, Anna growing more concerned. and then an awful truth started to come to light. \n\n>Craig, how long have you been searching for someone?\n\n>What do you mean? \n\n>I was doing some research on this bus\u2026 trying to figure out why you were so familiar. I realized I read your story when I was a little girl. \n\n>Anna stop. Stop talking about this. \n\n>No. I need to know. Are you\u2026 are you dead? \n\nI froze, rereading the message. Maybe she had misunderstood? \n\nThen he gave a reply. \n\n>Of course I am gone. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been so difficult to explain things to you. I don\u2019t want you frightened.\n\nThe moment I read the message a mirror image of that same message popped on screen. Craig was repeating what he said to Anna. \n\n*I don\u2019t want you frightened.*\n\nToo late for that. I was terrified because of the fact that I was now apparently texting a ghost. \n\n*What do you want from me?* I asked. \n\n*The same thing I wanted from Anna. I needed her to leave this place. But she wouldn\u2019t listen to me. Maybe you will\u2026.*\n\nI took out my phone and quickly did a search history on this bus the same way Anna had. \n\nSpecifically I was looking for tragic events surrounding this route. \n\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long to find one from only six years. The same time as the text messages. \n\n>Local woman jumps from a moving bus. \n\n>Anna Fitzgerald; a local real estate agent has been found dead near the corner of Fourth and Pine. Witnesses claim they heard her talking to herself or to an unseen person she frequently told to leave her alone before she leapt from the bus to her death when it was moving at approximately 75 miles per hour. \n\nI texted Craig. \n\n*Did you make her jump?*\n\n*Of course not! I didn\u2019t want that. But once she understood that I was going to try to be with her\u2026 she overreacted.*\n\n*You were going to be with her\u2026 you mean possessing her body.* \n\nThere was a long pause and I got a chill in the air. \n\nThe phone was how he found his victims. I understand that now. He left it here for a curious passerby like me to find. \n\n\nI stood up and pulled for the cord that would make the bus stop. The phone pinged again. \n\n*You can\u2019t leave me here on this bus\u2026 I won\u2019t let you. I have been here too long!*\n\nI tossed the phone down and tried again to get the bus to stop. It only sped up. \n\nI felt something overpower my body. I knew it had to be the spirit from Craig trying to enter my very soul. We were coming up to a curb. If I timed it right I could jump and survive. \n\nI moved toward the front of the bus as it began to slow down to pick up passengers. Now was the chance to escape. I rushed to get off even as the spirit overwhelmed me and I fell down, slamming into the concrete. \n\nBut somehow I made it and I was free from this strange encounter. \n\nI stood up and wiped blood from my lip as I turned to watch the bus roll off. The passengers had all acted like they couldn\u2019t see me, likely a side effect of this demonic influence. \n\nBut as it turned away I saw Craig\u2019s ghostly presence standing there, glaring at me. Somehow I was lucky to survive. \n\nI saw him pick up the old phone in his hand and then slide it under another seat. Waiting for another victim to be curious enough to find it . \n\n[330](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/KyleHarrisonwrites\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)\n\n[ODD](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Odd_directions\/)","6":"In my first week teaching in a Chicago inner city middle school, I watched a girl slash another girl's face with a retractable razor.  We went into lockdown when a man came onto the property during second period and shot a homeless man outside the front entrance doors.  I found four kids aged eleven and twelve smoking heroin in a janitors closet, and witnessed another student pouring lighter fluid into a milk crate of kittens.  Security got to him before he could light the match.  I thought these things would more than prepare me for the horrible things I might bare witness to here.  I was wrong.\n\nChiquan was a hopeless child. Everyday she came to school dirty and reeking.  The other kids called her names and refused to sit near her.  I let her shower in the locker room before school each day, and secretly I'd wash her clothes at my house.  Her sexual abuse started when she was only a toddler, and the perpetrators were many.  Whomever her mother could rent her out to in exchange for rocks.  But despite this, she still would come to class stinking of body odor, genuinely indicative of negative emotional arousal, the putridity spurred on by excess adrenaline.  The \"anger and despair\" scent.  \n\nIf only I had known the reasons why she needed to sleep in class all day, I'd have taken her in myself.  She wasn't learning a thing.  They tried putting her in special ed classes.  Most days she'd beg me in the form of notes written on torn paper to let her stay after so she didn't have to go home.  They'd read \"plz lt m syt\", but I knew what she meant.  Mostly she would sleep while I graded tests or reworked lesson plans.  But any inquiries into her tragic personal life would be met with uncontrollable rage.  Chiquan was the one who sliced up the other girl's face into oblivion.  \n\nSo I kept the monster at bay with silence, but eventually I'd have to go home to my wife and kids.  I'd touch her on the shoulder to wake her up, she'd arise in a stupor, and I'd gently help her up by her arm.  Very gently, or else the violence would unleash.  All of the information on her personal life was acquired after the following unfortunate event.  Again, had I known what she was going through, I'd have taken her in.  It happened the day I followed her home.\n\nI concealed myself in a dark hoodie and black pants, and trailed her through alleys and across a housing project yard.  She entered a vacant house boarded up with wood.  I knew her address, and was fully aware she wasn't at her home.  I drove to the address listed in our directory and knocked on the door.  A disheveled black man covered in what looked like lesions answered the door.  I asked for Chiquan.  From the background, a woman yelled out \"that bitch ain't welcome back in my motherfuckin' house.  You can tell her I said that!  Terrell, CLOSE the fucking door!\".\n\nThe man tossed a cigarette butt on his own carpet and slammed the door in my face.  But I needed to find out about this girl.  As a teacher and pillar of the community, I couldn't stand by and watch a child suffer.  I called police and informed them that my student was living alone inside of a condemned house on a dangerous street in the middle of winter.  I waited across the street for over thirty minutes, but they never showed up.\n\nHowever at one point, a tall, elderly man dressed in a garbage bag and ripped jeans entered the premises.  I called 911 again.  They informed me that the precinct of jurisdiction were held up on a \"serious\" call and would arrive when a unit was available.  I was asked if anyone's life was in danger.  I couldn't affirm it.  So, I exited my vehicle with a knife, my only weapon, and quietly snuck into the vacant.  It stunk like death, and upon the gentle vibration of my feet crossing the floorboards, roaches, hundreds of them, scattered into the darkness.\n\nThe place was a mess, and all that was burning for light, at least on the first floor, was a single oil lantern.  Lining the floor was newspaper covered in various stains.  There were milk crates everywhere, buckets of salt, and rotting containers of Chinese food.  And then, there was, in back, a dark staircase.  I heard commotion upstairs.  The steps creaked loudly, but the voices drowned it out.  My heart was pounding.  I could hear a man talking not with any palpable degree of intensity, but in a cavalier tone as if he was reciting the weather forecast.\n\nHis words were indecipherable, but I could clearly hear the bass in his voice, and also I could hear him chewing.  Atop the steps and directly to the left was aglow with a dim light.  It reeked of shit.  After the man would speak, a response in the gentle timbre of a child's voice would ring out in reply.  It was the monotone nature of the conversation that was chilling.  In a place so closely resembling some form of Hell, a creepy old man and a tormented child were chit chatting like a couple of friends on a suburban porch, high on weed and speaking softly as not to arouse the neighbors.\n\nI was moving slow as molasses, but the closer I got, the better I could make out words, and that's what still haunts me today.  That very first decipherable exchange.  \"I'll cut off the end of the steak if you put your fingers in\".  \"Like that?\".  \"No, deeper babe.  Yeah...yeah, all the way\".  \"Can I get the chicken?\".  \"You didn't want the steak?\".  \"Nah, the chicken\".  \"Okay.  Just fuck it\".  The sound of crumpling paper.  Tossed aside.  \"Get your clit hard for (what sounded like \"me\").  How I like it, then you can eat\".  \"But I'm getting really cold\".\n\nJesus fucking Christ.  Then the floor boards groaned with the weight of heavy legs standing up.  \"You getting cold?\".  \"Freezing.  Can't stop shivering\".  The calmness of the back and forth was absolutely unnerving.  Like they'd done this a million times.  A little girl and a old perverted child molester.  Then, more words, only this time, much worse.  \"Hold still\".  \"Ah!\".  \"Did that pinch?\".  \"Ah, yes.  It caught my skin\".  \"Just stay still\".  Heavy breathing.  Hyperventilating.  \"We'll get this over with soon.  Whose my good girl?\".  Weeping.  \"I...am\".  \"Come on, who is my good girl???\".  \"I AM!\".  Crying harder.  \n\nHer screams of pain drowned out the car doors slamming outside..  The sound of footsteps.  Then, knocking on the boarded door.  As quickly as I looked down at the door, I gazed back up at a tall, shadowy, imposing figure, arms almost as long as his slender body, staring down at me.  \"POLICE!  OPEN UP!\".  The man responded to me with a chilling statement.  \"You the priest, or are you ratting me out?\".  That's when police kicked in the door, and something dropped from the top of the steps.  A retractable razor, opened, and drenched in blood.  Chiquan continue to weep.\n\n\"Up there!  I called you guys!\", I explained as they tugged at me and began searching me.  \"I'm her teacher!\".  The two officers rushed up the stairs.  The man immediately got on his knees and placed his hands behind his head, as if he'd done this before.  I ran up the stairs.  Some things you wish you could \"un-see\".  This was one of them.  The officers basically pushed me away upon arriving at the top of the stairs, but I got a good enough look.  \n\nChiquan was splayed out on the cold floor, arms and legs spread eagle, nude, across a life sized pentagram drawn onto it with paint or chalk.  Her hands were cuffed to chains running to and fastened to a radiator.  Draped over her was a bedsheet soaked in blood on various parts of her flesh.  And on the floor were two half eaten hoagies.  He was using her in some sort of black mass ritual that involved sexual favors for food and shelter.  In the corner laid another lantern.  It must have been 25 degrees in that house, and she was bare naked.\n\nThe officers questioned me while a psychologist and team of EMTs arrived at the scene.  The old white man dragged out in cuffs.  I watched the EMT workers help Chiquan into the back of the ambulance shaking their heads in disbelief.  She was shivering in frenzied motion, unable stay still.  Without a doubt traumatized beyond all comprehension.  Nobody knows exactly how long she was in the asylum.  Chiquan never came back to school.  This happened eighteen years ago, and it's something I'll never forget, and something which will always haunt my dreams.  \n\nSometimes I pull up across from that vacant house and just watch in deep thought.  It torments me.  I have a scrupulous conscience now, wishing I could have done something.  I have nightmares that I'm inside of that house, watching from the ceiling this disgusting excuse for a human perform unthinkable acts on young Chiquan.  I went inside several times to look around, gun in hand.  It all looks the same.  Something draws me there.  Something sinister.  I know this because of what happened the last and final time I snuck inside.\n\nI decided I wanted to set fire to this evil, rotting sore in the heart of a city of rotting sores.  And in a way, this last visit traumatized me worse than that fateful night with Chiquan and the old man.  I entered the house with a flashlight.  Pitch darkness and cold.  After all these fucking years.  I had gasoline and a book of matches.  I sat them down, and moved toward the stairs, just to be sure nobody was there.  And just before I reached the first step, a deep, but very feminine voice, one that chilled my blood, spoke out from atop the pitch dark staircase -\n\n\"You should leave\".\n\nI backed away, and left everything as it was.  I'd never been so frightened, nor did I get far enough to look at this \"person\".  I don't know who was there, but that  voice rang out with an air of familiarity which I'd rather not explore in the twisted maze that is my mind.  But somehow, I felt I was in the presence of true evil that night.  I felt I was in the presence of Chiquan, but I don't want to know the answer to either of those questions.\n\nEvil breeds evil.\n\nThe End.","7":"[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/q48uss\/speed_limit_signs_are_suggestions\/) | [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/q7q4dr\/my_name_is_mike_and_i_run_security_for_the_dark\/) | [Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qh0r6v\/my_name_is_mike_and_i_run_security_for_the_dark\/) | [Part 4](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qnezeq\/my_name_is_mike_and_i_run_security_for_the_dark\/)\n\nIn her eyes, he's not a middle-aged man, but still eighteen, still a pizza boy.\n\nIn this moment between them, neither are killers. Neither of them has seen the flip side of darkness, what lies beyond the curtain. The wool is still pulled over their eyes.\n\nWhile the rest of us wait in silence, Gavin and Charlotte stare into one another. In another life, maybe they'd have grown old together, high school sweethearts riding off into a sunset or some other far-fetched dream like that.\n\nBut we don't live in that kind of world. None of us do. \n\n*The universe is a war*, as they say.\n\nWhen you realize that fundamental truth, you can never go back to the way things were, not even under perfect circumstances.\n\n\"I want to stand here staring into your eyes all day,\" Gavin says to Charlotte, \"but we've got business to take care of.\"\n\nCharlotte doesn't say anything. She just keeps staring. But when Gavin turns, she follows him.\n\nTogether, they lead us in the direction of the conference room. Gavin takes Charlotte's hand in his. The contrast is stark like a decaying body laid to rest in a field of flowers. Gavin's hand, calloused, almost withered; Charlotte's, still an eighteen-year-old's, despite the depraved clay she's molded.\n\nHe's taller than her by a head, but age is shrinking him; he walks with a stoop; his lower back burns like hell and no amount of IcyHot will cool it. Scars run across the parts of his body that aren't covered by clothing. The future he was sent to has chewed him up and spit out the cud.\n\nWe get to the conference room and walk inside. Milly and Mr. Gray are there, reviewing an upcoming mission to deliver special sauce with a group of their loyal grunts. Charlotte and Gavin walk in; Milly and Mr. Gray don't even notice them at first. They avert their eyes from Charlotte, who they've come to hate so much they can't even bear to look at her.\n\nInstead, they focus on me: the shithead lackey who carries out her orders. I'm someone they can place their anger on, someone with a smaller seat at the table.\n\n\"Going well so far, Mike,\" says Mr. Gray. \"Your plan\u2013\u2013run drugs, let those bastards catch up, interrogate them after the inevitable shootout. Except it hasn't worked out that way. They've skullfucked every single one of our transports. It's not even a\u2013\u2013\"\n\nHe stops mid-sentence. His face goes white, then the temperature gets turned up, and it goes red.\n\n\"You motherfucker.\"\n\nGavin cracks a smile. \n\n\"Nice to see you again.\"\n\nMilly glares at Gavin with venom so potent it makes Mr. Gray's look like lemon juice. I follow Gavin's eyes. He's looking at her arm, which is youthful, somehow, despite her age. The skin isn't old and wrinkled like her opposite one. It's like a middle schooler's arm, someone not much younger than Charlotte. \n\n\"Sorry about your arm,\" says Gavin. \"But you grow them back, right?\"\n\nHim and Milly share some secret that predates everyone in the room. None of us are in on it, except a few of the OGs who look pissed, scared, and\/or indifferent. Milly's strange arm isn't the surprising part about all this\u2013\u2013it's the dude who came back from the future aged by twenty years that's got them vexed.\n\n\"I told Sloan we should've just executed you,\" says Milly. \"You're like the goddamn clap. Or herpes. Take your pick. Just won't go away, will you?\"\n\nGavin shrugs.\n\n\"You were right. Sloan was wrong. She thought kicking my ass through that door was a one-way ticket. But here I am, the gift that keeps on giving.\"\n\nHis nonchalance is astounding. In Gavin, I see someone who simply does not give a fuck. He was born with two or three shits to give, and he gave them a long while back. Small fries like Mr. Gray and Milly\u2013\u2013the arm-regenerating veteran of Dark Convoy Human Resources\u2013\u2013are the least of his worries.\n\nCharlotte breaks the tension.\n\n\"He came back,\" she says. \n\n\"Well, I'll be,\" says Mr. Gray. \"Thanks for that, Charlotte. I didn't put the pieces together.\"\n\nCharlotte's cadre of bodyguards\u2013\u2013Prim, Spike, and Walter\u2013\u2013move a little bit closer to Mr. Gray, Milly, and their followers. Talking shit to Charlotte while they're around is like feeding raw meat to a rabid dog. You better hope you pull your hand back in time to keep it.\n\n\"He came back,\" Charlotte clarifies, \"to warn us.\"\n\n\"About?\"\n\n\"About what the Whitlocks are really up to,\" says Gavin.\n\n\"We're all ears,\" says Milly.\n\nGavin sits down in a chair and kicks his feet up on the lacquered walnut conference table. There are people around him. People behind him who could cut his throat from ear to ear if they got the nod. But Gavin's a winning horse. He's nonchalant because he's earned the right to be, one belt notch at a time.\n\n\"Sit,\" says Gavin, and everyone does.\n\nHe pulls something out of his pocket. It's a joint; maybe in the future, they grow weed on Mars because this green smells other-fucking-worldly. Gavin lights it up and draws deep, then blows a milky cloud of smoke right in Mr. Gray and Milly's direction.\n\n\"You remember the Hovel?\" he asks.\n\n*I* remember the Hovel. I'll never forget it\u2014the Haunted House on wheels. A sort of gateway that leads to an alternate dimension, wherever the Puppeteers\u2013\u2013the Hovels proprietors\u2013\u2013hail from. I went inside on a mission with Charlotte to destroy it. We went at the Whitlocks' behest. They tricked us into believing that an antimatter bomb we took with us would destroy the thing from the inside out. But in reality, it was a tracking device.\n\nThe Whitlocks used us to tag it. We got used. Insane megalomaniacs that they are, the Whitlocks used us to capture a superweapon\u2013\u2013a place that manifests your worst fears, that eats you alive if you go inside\u2013\u2013so they could use it for whatever end game they dreamed up.\n\n\"Yes,\" says Milly. \"Now get to the point.\"\n\nGavin takes another deep pull from the joint; breathes another cloud of smoke into the air.\n\n\"Alright,\" he says, \"so here's the scoop. In the future, where I came from\u2013\u2013where I landed thanks to Sloan, may she rest in piss\u2013\u2013suffice it to say the Whitlocks are doing just fucking fine.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asks Mr. Gray. \n\n\"I mean, isn't that what they all want?\" asks Gavin. \"Isn't that what anyone wants? The tech giants from right here and now\u2013\u2013there's this race to the moon that gets chalked up to the human spirit of innovation. But we're all just scared shitless. It's what motivates anything. The Jeff Bezos' and Elon Musks' and Mark Zuckerbergs' of the world sweat through their sheets just like the rest of us. They're scared of dying. Scared of moving on and leaving their empires to crumble after they're gone. All they want is a little immortality.\"\n\n\"That's why the Whitlocks took the Hovel,\" continues Gavin. \"Because they're scared of it like they should be. They wanted to turn that fear into something positive. They wanted to book their ticket to the future. While the rest of the Space Dicks ride dildo-shaped rockets a few miles into the atmosphere, the Whitlocks are focused on a bigger end-game: immortality. And they're smart as fuck, because in harnessing the power of the Puppeteers, they've found it.\"\n\n\"What are they doing there?\" asks Charlotte. \"Or *then*\u2013\u2013the future.\"\n\n\"Ruling supreme,\" says Gavin. \"Conquering the fucking universe, one scorched planet at a time. Earth is an uninhabitable scab. The Whitlocks have gone onto greener pastures, but it's a controlled burn. Believe me\u2013\u2013the future is not something you want to witness. Nuking the shit out of ourselves is preferable, but if the Whitlocks get their way\u2013\u2013if we don't change the course of things\u2013\u2013it doesn't happen that way.\"\n\n\"It all takes place in our digs,\" he says. \"The Milky Way and beyond. The Hovel is a wormhole, not unlike your beloved Road to Nowhere. Except it's a hell of a lot more powerful. And because the Whitlocks have mastered it\u2013\u2013since they've figured out how it works\u2013\u2013they go from one place to the next, gathering resources, taking more real estate, pissing on the ashes they leave behind.\"\n\n\"What's the end game?\" asks Tommy. I'd forgotten he was even there. I like the kid's gumption. One night under my wing has been enough to make him think he owns the place. It's downright inspiring.\n\n\"Good question,\" says Gavin. \"And that's the scary part. These people\u2013Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, etcetera\u2013don't have an end game. They don't know what the fuck they're doing. They're chasing butterflies.\"\n\nGavin turns to Charlotte. I notice her tense up\u2013\u2013something about the word *butterflies*, a secret they share, scares them equally.\n\n\"Jury's still out,\" says Gavin. \"On what the Whitlocks want, I mean. I'm not even sure they know. But they spare no expense in finding it. I think in essence, it boils down to immortality, though. Self-preservation\u2013\u2013empire building. But in all my searching, in all my efforts to fight back with the rest of the universe against them, I haven't sussed out what this empire their envisioning is. Or what self-preservation and immortality look like in their eyes. My best guess is the whole infinitely expanding universe deal\u2013\u2013the theory that it never ends. They plan to go right on expanding with it, ad infinitum.\"\n\n\"We need to stop them,\" he says, \"and let the fucking universe settle down a bit. None of us are in control\u2013\u2013that's what they don't realize. For all the string pulling the Puppeteers do, I don't think they're in control either. It's bigger than us. But maybe if we all just fucking relax a bit, we can find some peace and quiet before this whole experiment snuffs out.\"\n\nGavin takes another lungful of intergalactic reefer. He's picked his side, and he's not budging.\n\n\"The Dark Convoy is not a charity,\" says Milly. \"We're not interested in humanitarian causes. Maybe we're looking for immortality ourselves.\"\n\n\"And that's the fucked up part, isn't it?\" asks Gavin. \"If you had more power\u2013\u2013if you were more than a shell of a trucking company\u2013\u2013maybe you'd be the ones who captured the Hovel. Maybe you'd be the ones divvying up galactic real estate, however many years from now.\"\n\nThere's a stark divide in the room\u2013\u2013those who are scared by what Gavin's saying and those who are invigorated by it. It's not good and bad, black and white. It's not as simple as that. Everyone in the room is equally scared of death, just like Gavin suggested, and we're deciding which horse we want to bet on. Immortality, or mortality. Expansion or consolidation. Raising hell or chilling the fuck out. \n\nGavin takes another drag, breathes out another lungful of smoke. His eyes have gone hazy, relaxed. Like I said, he's settled squarely on chilling the fuck out. But from what I can tell, from the dangerous look in his eyes, he realizes that reaching that end is still gonna take a whole lot of violence.\n\n\"Fucked up, sure,\" says Mr. Gray. \"The situation, I mean. Our desire for self-preservation. But if you don't want *fucked up*, I suggest you find a different universe. I say we get on our knees and fucking beg the Whitlocks to let us do their laundry. No more of this bullshit that you all kicked off, of us trying to stop them. We had a good thing going. We had an arrangement. We were doing just fine before you all swooped in.\"\n\n\"Hey now,\" says Gavin. \"As I remember it, you invited me. Back when all this began. I went to a warehouse\u2013\u2013I took Sloan's test. I started working for the Dark Convoy, but it was because you all didn't give me an option.\"\n\n\"And boy do I regret it,\" says Milly. \"A massive oversight on our part. You've never been more than a pawn, though.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" says Gavin. \"You were trying to use me to get to Charlotte. Because once, before your shithole trucking company took a nosedive, her great-grandpa was in charge. Those were the good old days. And you saw someone you could mold. Or someone you could kill to make sure things stayed right on course. Which was it? As I remember it, you handed her over to the Keeper willingly. I think she deserves an explanation.\"\n\nAn even deeper silence takes over the room. The plot points begin coming together. I wasn't involved initially, but I learned about everything that happened over time. Charlotte's relative\u2013\u2013the legendary Tip Hankins\u2013\u2013was in charge of the Dark Convoy before he died. Charlotte never knew about him; she never knew her birthright. So the Dark Convoy used Gavin\u2013\u2013a pizza boy who could drive his ass off\u2013\u2013to get closer to her. Two birds with one stone.\n\nBut when Gavin realized what they were up to\u2013\u2013when his compass started spinning cattywampus, telling him the Dark Convoy was more morally fucked than he originally thought\u2013\u2013he tried to stop them. And in doing so, he kicked the dominos. They began to fall. The Dark Convoy hedged its bets and went after Charlotte, handing her over to a serial killer who wanted to skin her and add her to his gallery.\n\n*Chasing* *butterflies*\u2013\u2013it clicks. His name was The Keeper. And that inciting event\u2013\u2013remembering it still scares Charlotte and Gavin, both. But Gavin stopped them. And Charlotte paid the fuckers back, taking up her great-grandpa's mantle, changing the trajectory of the Dark Convoy forever.\n\nMaybe it was always supposed to happen that way.\n\n\"Did you want to kill me all along?\" asks Charlotte, turning to Milly and Mr. Gray. \"Or only after you realized that you had it wrong about Gavin?\"\n\n\"We were unsure,\" says Milly. \"I knew your great-grandpa, Tip. He was a legend around here. And in you, I saw someone who could lead our faltering organization. But then this asshole\"\u2013\u2013she points to Gavin, who's busy taking another pull from his half-finished joint\u2013\u2013\"this asshole decided to get fancy. So yes, at Sloan's suggestion, we tried to kill you. The Keeper paid *us* to let him do it. It's all business, Charlotte. It's only ever been about good business.\"\n\n\"Not anymore,\" says Charlotte. \"We're a charity from here on out.\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't need to tell me twice,\" says Milly. \"It's been heading in that direction for a while now.\"\n\nI keep my hand close to my gun. There's so much tension in the room it feels like gravity is pulling on us all, pulling us closer\u2013\u2013dangerously closer\u2013\u2013so close that one false move will end in a rain of blood. Maybe if we all just snuff out, the world will be a better place. But then I remember what Gavin said about the Whitlocks and their plans and the burned-to-cinders future he came back from to warn us about.\n\nIf my life amounts to changing the winds of that dire fate, then so be it. I can pull a trigger like the best of them.\n\n\"I've got an idea,\" says Gavin, breaking the tension. \"I think everyone can go home happy.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll fucking be,\" says Mr. Gray. \"Let's give you the mic and hear all about it. I mean, you've proved you're trustworthy so far. Why not hand you the keys?\"\n\n\"Bitch, I already have the keys,\" says Gavin. He holds them up\u2013\u2013the keys to his supercharged Dodge Demon, which is sitting out in the parking lot just waiting for him to hop in. \"I'm driving out of this in one piece with or without you. I'll keep fighting even if you insist on sticking your head back up your ass. But if you shut the fuck up for a second, I'd like to tell you about how we stop the Whitlocks and became rich as balls in the process.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEvery one of these fucking things becomes a heist. These \"seasons,\" I mean. \n\n* Girlfriend gets stolen by a serial killer; protagonist steals her back\n* Asshole space dicks hire an organization to steal a super weapon; get double-crossed\n\nFrom what Gavin's saying, this one seems like it's headed in the same direction. \n\n\"You gotta be fucking shitting me.\"\n\n\"I shit you not.\"\n\n\"Okay, so let me get this straight: we're stealing a pair of castrated nuts.\"\n\n\"That's Part A of the plan. And we're stealing the castrated nuts of Cameron Whitlock, Jr., to be precise. The same set you so willingly handed over on the night Charlotte got pulled in this mess.\"\n\n\"And your theory is that in doing so, we'll cut off the snake at its head. We'll stop the future\u2013\u2013the future you witnessed\u2013\u2013from ever coming to pass.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh. The same plot as Terminator 2. Except instead of Arnie's cyborg hand, we're stealing a schlong and a pair of crown jewels belonging to Cameron Whitlock, Jr. Keep in mind though, that's just Part A.\"\n\n\"And Part B\u2013\u2013that involves this woman\u2013\u2013this *thing*\u2013\u2013that you call the Seamstress.\"\n\nGavin had filled them in on what we saw at the warehouse. He told them about the Seamstress and how she'd haunted a small town before, peeling the flesh of the youth off to satisfy some sort of insatiable, cosmic hunger. The Whitlocks heard she had a sewing machine for a mouth and decided to use her to stitch up their super-soldier abominations\u2013\u2013the same ones who've been fucking up our shit for months.\n\nGavin told us that Plan B involved capturing the Seamstress, studying whatever makes her work, and potentially\u2013\u2013after Mr. Gray queried about the possibility\u2013\u2013selling the \"technology\" to the highest bidder. But the core objective was to use the Seamstress to replenish the broken ranks of the Dark Convoy.\n\nSelf-regenerating super soldiers? We could use our own army of them. I couldn't argue with the logic.\n\n\"More numbers,\" says Gavin. \"More firepower. You keep doing whatever it is you do, and we can police shit, keep the Whitlocks in check even after microwaving Junior's genitalia. We can create our own army of zombies and make sure this shit never happens again.\"\n\n\"Some plan,\" says Milly. \"And an elaborate one.\"\n\n\"Not *some* plan,\" says Gavin. \"*The* plan. Besides, what you all have been doing recently isn't *good business,* even though you've tricked yourself into believing it is. It's not good business in the fucking slightest. What I'm proposing helps everyone. Balance out the future, kickstart the Dark Convoy, and ride off into the sunset singing kumbaya.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" says Milly. It surprises me\u2013\u2013she doesn't even put up a fight. \"Fine. We're screwed regardless. May as well throw up a Hail Mary.\"\n\nMr. Gray shakes his head.\n\n\"I'm not so sure. If Plan A\u2013\u2013stealing the Whitlock crown jewels\u2013\u2013or Plan B\u2013\u2013capturing the Seamstress\u2013\u2013fails, then we're going to have even worse numbers than we have now. Like I said before, I suggest getting on our fucking knees and begging for the Whitlocks' forgiveness. If the future is as much of a shit show as you're saying, I'd rather be on the winning side.\"\n\nGavin turns to Charlotte.\n\n\"We leave up to our leader,\" he says. \n\nEveryone turns to her. She looks stumped, scared. The armor she's created for herself is cracking\u2013\u2013Gavin showing up has thrown a wrench in things. Charlotte's still eighteen. I think she'd be okay just running away, going to a cabin in the woods, hunkering down with Gavin while the world ends. And I don't blame her in the slightest. But though there's still a subtle ember of love between them, I know that Gavin is all business. He can't unsee what he's seen. He can't deny it.\n\nHe's going on this two-part suicide mission with or without us.\n\n\"How do we divvy things up?\" asks Charlotte, turning to him. \"The responsibilities, I mean. Part A, then Part B?\"\n\n\"Same time,\" says Gavin. \"It has to be. Or close, anyhow. We'll use the Road to Nowhere\u2013\u2013\"\n\nHe turns to me. \n\n\"\u2013\u2013and this fella is riding shotgun with me, making sure the whole thing goes down exactly like we've written it up.\"\n\n\"And you won't change your mind?\" asks Charlotte.\n\nShe's looking Gavin straight in the eyes. She wants him to say that he will. She still wants a happy ending. \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he says, turning to her. \"I'm sorry I left. I'm sorry I went to that warehouse, that I got involved with these assholes, that I let them pull me in. I'm sorry your life will never be the same, Charlotte. But that's the way the game got dealt. We're in it, either way.\"\n\n\"Okay then,\" she says, not missing a beat. \"Part A and Part B. That's our mission.\"\n\nMr. Gray shakes his head and then turns to his C-suite comrade.\n\n\"Milly?\"\n\n\"Part A and Part B,\" she says. \"We need to start preparing. And the first step is to accept the genuine possibility that in short order, we should all start kissing our asses goodbye.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe lay the groundwork and agree to come back tomorrow morning to pick things up. I think we're leaving too much time between ideation and execution; things can go south in a minute, and an entire night off is a risk. But a job as big as this takes rest and recovery. I realize we don't have an option but to wait.\n\n\"Before you head out,\" says Gavin, turning to me, \"I want to show you something.\"\n\nCharlotte and I follow Gavin. Tommy joins us; Prim, Spike, and Walter come too, sticking to Charlotte like white on rice. We go inside Charlotte's office. Gavin closes the door and locks it. He makes his way over to the blinds and draws them. The halogen lights in the parking lot overhead snuff out.\n\nAnd then things change. Gavin's eyes close; he holds up his hands.\n\nHe begins *sculpting* the air. \n\nIn an instant, the office becomes a planetarium\u2013\u2013a theatre built to show the night sky, the universe, the celestial expanse of our world, and all the infinite worlds beyond it. Gavin's eyes open, and he continues orchestrating the darkness.\n\nI see stars form in midair like motes of dust. I reach out and touch them; they sizzle; they speak to one another; they're alive. I see planets hanging from invisible threads like mobiles, rotating, turning at different speeds. And I see far beyond them, beyond the bright sun at the center of our galaxy. \n\nLooking on with the others, my eyes follow a fleet of spaceships\u2013\u2013like microscopic toy airplanes\u2013\u2013that take flight from Earth.\n\nAn Earth that isn't blue and green but is a shade of dead and dusty gray.\n\n\"They leave however many years from now,\" says Gavin. \"No idea why it happens, but that's not why we're here, is it? You can only stop so many things from happening if you can stop anything at all.\"\n\nI feel like I've taken a bong rip of Gavin's cosmic chronic; I feel like I've taken a shot of liquid, galaxy-bending THC straight to the fucking jugular. I've done no small amount of drugs; this dwarfs anything I've ever experienced.\n\nThe tiny ships continue flying away from our dying home. They leapfrog from planet to planet\u2013\u2013Mars; then, miraculously, Venus, which I'd always thought uninhabitable; then, back in the direction of the moons of Jupiter, of Saturn, of the blue and green gas giants beyond. \n\nThe moons adjacent to the planets die, too. And more ships join the exodus. They multiply. With each stop along the journey, a dusty gray scab is left behind.\n\nI look around the room. In what meager light there is, I see expressions of shock, sadness, anger\u2013\u2013a million other emotions that have no name, that I didn't know existed, that I didn't know were possible. They're ratios between elements of the emotional spectrum; sentiments so powerful I wonder if our heads will just quit fucking ticking and explode.\n\nBut Gavin continues narrating our journey into darkness. Our eyes\u2013\u2013peeled in horror\u2013\u2013follow his tracing fingertips.\n\n\"I came out here,\" he says. He points to what looks like a circular door\u2013\u2013starlike\u2013\u2013made of bright blue light. It spits out into the blackness of space miles above an unknown planet. Without Gavin pointing it out, I might have mistaken it for a faint star or missed it entirely. \n\nHow many other doorways are there?\n\nI watch as the ships sail from one planet to the next, one galaxy to the next. \n\n\"I followed the screams,\" says Gavin. \"Even in the silence of space\u2013\u2013they were so fucking clear.\"\n\nThe ships continue multiplying like house flies born from a fresh mound of garbage. And I realize then that they're not flying; they're floating. Their drivers might think they're in control, but they're mistaken\u2013\u2013the ships are attached to invisible strings.\n\nSome invisible Puppeteer, far above, far outside of comprehension, pulls them along.\n\nI follow Gavin's tracing fingertip to a planet near where he came out of space.\n\n\"We formed a resistance,\" says Gavin. \"The people, the beings that I met there. They knew the Whitlocks were coming. They heard the screams in space, too. They banded together, me with them. And we listened as the screams became louder, closer.\"\n\nGavin's kept a straight face so far; now, I notice fear. The ships, pulled forward on their strings, land amidst the neighboring moons of the planet Gavin settled on.\n\n\"Why'd the door spit out there?\" asks Charlotte. \"The one Sloan pushed you through?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" says Gavin. \"I ask myself that every day. Maybe I heard the screams subconsciously. Maybe I went there on my own. I've never believed in God\u2013\u2013maybe I still don't\u2013\u2013but coming out of that doorway there, at that time, was an act of mercy. I can't take credit for the resistance\u2013\u2013the beings there put up one hell of a fight.\"\n\nHe stares off into the stars of the room, his focus getting lost amidst them.\n\n\"It has to be God, doesn't it? Or Goddess, a higher power, whatever you want to call it. Something benevolent\u2013\u2013something that cares about our suffering. Something isn't completely fucking indifferent to it.\"\n\nWe zoom in on the conquerors. Emblazoned on their ships, I see the name Whitlock: *Whitlock Ventures*. They've multiplied by rabbits; they've been joined by other power-hungry villains, and they rape and pillage the planet as Gavin and the others fight back. Scalps are taken, entire bandoliers of them. The conquerors\u2013\u2013the Whitlocks and their collaborators\u2013\u2013are soaked in gore. They rip eyeballs out of skulls; they say strange prayers, offering the eyes up to the all-seeing Puppeteers looking down from overhead, who relish in the carnage.\n\nThen, from the opposite side of the faraway planet, I see a single ship go up. An orb\u2013\u2013a marble. A shimmering vessel that rises from the war-torn planet below toward the gate that Gavin came through.\n\n\"They asked me to go back,\" he says. \"To stop it; to cut off the head of the snake. And eventually, I put it together. That stopping what happens then means changing what's happening now. Snuffing out the entire fucking Whitlock line in the present day.\"\n\nThe ship holding Gavin\u2013\u2013the glowing marble\u2013\u2013rolls back through the doorway Sloan kicked him through.\n\nAnd then, in Gavin's absence, I see something that makes my guts plummet. The planet he landed on, where the resistance was formed, dries up like a dusty gray scab. The ships carrying the Whitlocks and their collaborators rise, just like they have from every other planet. \n\nThey continue their pathway through the galaxy. I hear the screams of terror in the silence of space\u2014people\u2013\u2013beings\u2013\u2013dying by the thousands, by the millions.\n\nGavin snaps his fingers, and the lights go on. Sweat has soaked through my shirt; the others in the room\u2013\u2013Tommy, Prim, Spike, and Walter\u2013\u2013are equally terrified. Charlotte is terrified too. But she also looks invigorated, more determined than ever.\n\nA sliver of hope, however thin, works its way into my despair. I'm with Charlotte\u2013\u2013all in. I'll follow her to the end.\n\n\"Now you know what's at stake,\" says Gavin.\n\nI do. There's no doubt about it. And though Charlotte emboldens me, I'm still terrified that our efforts to stop the screaming will be in vain.\n\nr\/WestCoastDerry\n\n\\[[TCC](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TheCrypticCompendium\/)\\]","8":"Title says it all. I don't care what the doctors, teachers, police, my parents, or anyone else in this backward-ass town says. There's *no such thing* as Spontaneous Human Malnutrition.\n\nFuck, you probably haven't even heard of it. Well, no, of course you haven't heard of it, it's *not fucking real.* Spontaneous Human Malnutrition. SHM. Those three letters didn't just ruin my last year of middle school. They've ruined my damn life.\n\nIt's like every adult in town has gone mad. People don't just\u2026 they don't\u2026\n\nFuck. Fuckety fucksticks. How to even begin?\n\nIt started during the Covid lockdowns. It wasn't until the fifth or sixth case that the local news started putting the pieces together. That's three weeks after Grant and I started our investigation, bee tee dubz. We knew something was up from the third victim. Why? Because the third victim was Doug's Mom.\n\nDoug is (or was) the third member of our cafeteria-loser Musketeers set-up. When his Mom\u2026 when whatever SMH *actually is* happened to her, she was in the background of our weekly D&D Zoom session. Doug was shaking dice and praying to the nerd gods for a critical when a weird noise came from his audio. It was barely half a second long, almost too quick to notice, but it was *loud.* Like, real fucking loud. So loud that Doug jumped a few inches in his seat and dropped the dice.\n\nGrant and I never found out if Doug hit that crit. His blonde bowl-cut whipped away from the screen before we heard the clattering of dice on polished wood. Me and Grant didn't really care too much about killing cave trolls anymore though. Both of us were glued to the scene playing out in Doug's kitchen.\n\nThe noise had come from Doug's Mom. She'd stumbled into shot, clutching the kitchen sink. She was vibrating. Not trembling, not shaking, *vibrating*. The motion didn't seem to be coming from any of her muscles. It was rapid jolting like that caused by pneumatic tools rather than fits and convulsions. She'd fallen to the floor by the time Doug reached her, totally rigid and still juddering so fast that her form on my screen was barely more than a blur. From the angle I couldn't see too much of what was going on. I saw Doug reach down to touch her, heard him yelp in pain, started yelling along with him when he recoiled and held up the stumps where his fingers had been. My speakers screeched at the moment he made contact; a horrible shrill grinding with a wet edge, the exact same noise Freddy Gruber's elbow made when he accidentally leant on a power-sander in wood shop back in 6th grade.\n\nDoug had no colour left in his face. He wasn't aware of Grant and I yelling to him through our webcams, either. His Mom's ankles were still vibrating, the pace now so rapid that a cloud of sawdust started billowing from the floorboards beneath her. We were all screaming, Grant and I in terror, Doug from terror and blinding agony. Before any of us could find the scrap of calm needed to dial 911, Doug's Mum let out a violent spasm.\n\nThen, with no warning, she fell still.\n\nThe last frames of the Zoom call were Doug, standing over his Mom's still and smoking body, pleading with her to wake up. I liked Doug's Mom. She was like an aunt to me. I'm glad I didn't have to see any more of her post-SHM than those thin, nearly-fleshless ankles. I hadn't seen what SHM did to a person in full yet. I wouldn't have to wait long, within a week it'd be on the front page of both the local Tribute *and* Herald. At the time though all I could do was sit in lockdown isolation and ruminate, robbing myself of sleep for days trying to make any kind of sense out of what the fuck I'd just seen.\n\nThat was my first brush with SHM. We were locked down so I couldn't get to Doug. By the time the Covid quarantines finished he'd been sent off to some institution. That's how Grant and I knew we had to keep our fucking mouths shut. Doug didn't, you see. He was *very* vocal about what he saw, and *even more* *vocal* about how Spontaneous Human Malnutrition was a load of bullshit. Doug knew he was being lied to, and so did we. We didn't have the anger of losing our fucking Mom to drive us though. I think that's why Doug took a different approach. He didn't think sleuthing would get him anywhere. Answers need to be taken, not found, he'd said. We tried to stop him, but once he got the idea to set fire to a police station in his head there was no getting it out.\n\nYeah, 2020 was definitely one of *those* years for me.\n\nAnyway, as I said, Doug's Mom was the third victim, and it wasn't until the fifth or sixth that the media started connecting dots. There was nothing about the vibrating of course. *That* seemed to be being kept deliberately under wraps. What led local newscasters to connect the occurrences was the apparent containment within our town, and the\u2026 how shall I put this\u2026 *unique* state the victims are found in.\n\nIt's from the victims that the SHM lie was created. *You* won't find any info on it. I know this because I'm not stupid, one of the *first things* I did when the disappearances started was liaise with my out-of-town contacts. The ONLY SHM info online is on the web pages of local schools, hospitals, community centers etc. Try and access any of these from an IP outside the county? 404'd my friends. Try and get around that with a VPN? SWAT time. Only took two reports of *that* in our paranormal investigation Discord for Grant and Me to realize we were completely fucking alone. Everyone wants to help until helping means an armed unit at the door.\n\nBut what is the SHM lie? The clue is in the name.\n\n*Spontaneous*, because it happens suddenly and without any prior warning. There's no rhyme or reason to *who* gets picked, or when. Oldest victim was in their 80's, youngest was young enough that there are too many first graders around here familiar with funerals. Some go in their sleep, others (like Doug's Mom) when they're hum-drumming through their daily grind. There's no sign it's coming either. Well, that we knew of at least. It wasn't like any of the victims were around to recount what they experienced in the lead-up. Whatever happens, it happens suddenly. Nobody reported feeling unwell prior to getting SHM'd. They're fine one second, buzzing so hard they're dangerous to touch the next.\n\nThe *Human* part is obvious. It's the *M* in SHM, the *Malnutrition*, that's the biggest part of the lie.\n\nA local doctor coined the term based on the state victims were left in after the deadly super-convulsions. No matter their size beforehand, every SHM victim came out the other end looking\u2026 well, malnourished. *Extremely* malnourished. The kind of malnourished that the term \"*0% body fat\"* was made for. They showed a couple photos on the news and in the papers like I said, pictures that all came with a disclaimer that sensitive viewers would find them distressing. Apparently, we're *all* sensitive viewers when it comes to SHM. Even the local news anchors. It's a shame actually that the internet blacklisting means the clip of *76News* host Chip Dallas bursting into tears live on-air won't make it to YouTube. Despite the grim context it's still pretty funny to see such a corny POS lose their shit so bad.\n\nWe didn't think it was funny at the time though, of course. Took a few days of emotional distance before we found enough teenage edginess to force a laugh at his blubbering. Mainly because it meant we both had to lie about the fact that we'd been crying too.\n\nIt's the eyes that do it. Nothing prepares you for them, even in a photograph.\n\nWhen you hear about something called Spontaneous Human Malnutrition you expect to see ribcages. You expect to see bones and joints sticking out at odd angles, draped in a sheet-thin layer of near translucent skin that leaves nothing of the anatomy within to imagination. As harrowing as seeing those peeled-back lips, those teeth sticking up jagged and crooked from shriveled gums, can be, you're not blindsided by them. The sight of their distended bellies is haunting, sure, but if you've ever seen what *normal* malnutrition looks like then you're not in unfamiliar territory. The severity of it will take you back no doubt. Being able to see every crease and fold of a person's lower intestine is jarring even if you're given a heads up, after all. Despite your shock though, these things *won't* create any kind of cognitive dissonance for you. They're about on-par with what your brain will conjure when you read the phrase \"*died of starvation\".*\n\nThe eyes though? No amount of disclaimers or trigger warnings could prep you enough for the eyes.\n\nFirst thing off was the look of the face surrounding them. Every single SHM victim I've seen had the same expression. Terror, complete and utter terror. *All of them* died screaming. The eyeballs themselves are far, far worse though. Unnatural. No disease can do that, and I know because Grant and I researched it for weeks. It doesn't matter what color your eyes are before SMH. When you come out the other end of it they'll be black. Not black like coal or like ink or shadow, black like the darkest reaches of deep space. The kind of black that absorbs all light, so nothing twinkles or shimmers in them. You've seen a shark's eyes, right? Imagine them but a thousand times darker. *That's* why everyone watching Chip Dallas' 76News special on the mysterious new disease that had so far taken six people was crying, screaming, or laughing uncontrollably.\n\nNot everyone lapped up the disease lie, though. It's a small town but it's not *that* small. We've got two high schools. Grant and I were far from the only ones who saw Spontaneous Human Malnutrition for the bullshit it was. You know what they say about the truth though. A lie can hold it down and beat the shit out of it before it even knows it's in a fight.\n\nDoug was the first non-believer to get, as we were told, \"*sent away\".* He'd tried to burn down a police station though. When they took him we weren't at all surprised. It wasn't until Brian Jarrick's quote-unquote \"*suicide*\" that Grant and I realized just how far the Mayor\/police\/government\/military\/whoever was prepared to go to keep everything covered up.\n\nIt was six months after the first SHM case, so that's about 102 confirmed deaths for context. At the regular nightly vigils the townsfolk would say nothing with their lips but *everything* with their furtive glances and nervous floor fixations. Brian Jarrick is\u2026 *was*, a local podcaster. Before SHM he'd talked mainly about nature trails in the closest national park, or shows that were coming through one of the three theatres we boasted. As the SHM epidemic unfolded this all changed. Brian saw through the bullshit too, and he was *very* vocal about it. He had the balls to ask the questions on his podcast Grant and I would only whisper to each other in our quiet corner of the cafeteria.\n\nIf it's a disease then where's the CDC?\n\nWhy hasn't this gained national\/international attention?\n\nWhat kind of disease turns your eyes like that?\n\nWhere does all the body mass they've lost go?\n\nHow can they vibrate so fast it sands down wood but they remain physically unscathed?\n\nWhy hasn't it spread outside the boundaries of our town?\n\nWhy aren't the death certificates public?\n\nHow come their clothes look ragged and old by the time they stop moving?\n\nBrian became a firebrand, a preacher voicing the doubts we all shared, the questions so many of us had but were all too afraid to ask. He'd known they were coming for him, too. You can probably guess the story. Night before his suicide he abjectly stated that he would *under no circumstances* commit suicide. When the first guy to point this out on Facebook was reported dead an hour later the message became pretty clear. After that pretty much every public doubter and worried citizen kept their mouths shut.\n\nGrant and I didn't accept it though. We *couldn't.* It *wasn't* a disease. We didn't know *what* it was, but we knew that there was no such fucking thing as Spontaneous Human Malnutrition. We were being lied to, and unless we could figure out why we wouldn't be safe. We both begged our respective parents to move out of town of course, but you can imagine how that went down. Grant's Dad told him to \"stop being a pussy\", mine sat me down and gave me a lecture on the \"importance of not running from your problems\". Both of them, and our Moms, brought into the SHM lie. I'm not going to lie, so heavy was my sense of helplessness that I cried myself to sleep most nights after that one. If it weren't for Grant the sense of isolation, that feeling of being the only sane one in the nuthouse, would have broken me.\n\nGrant's not me. He's made of tougher stuff. Whereas I retreated into existential despair, Grant decided Brian Jarrick's death as the catalyst to get up and get shit done. That's why he was the one that managed to gather the puzzle pieces and put them together. It took him a little while though. A few months and several dozen more bodies happened before the morning he arrived at my door with a cardboard box full of laptops. I still remember his expression as clear as day. He was the phrase \"I've done it\" personified, but where his wide grin wore the phrase triumphantly his eyes bore it with guilt, shame, and fear.\n\nHe made me help him carry the box up to my room to dump the dozen-or-so old laptops onto my bed. I had to run through every variation of \"what the fuck\" that I knew before he spewed a rambling near-breathless explanation.\n\nHe'd started with the footage recorded from our DnD session. He'd been planning to keep it a surprise, but he'd been recording them to put together an animated highlight reel for Doug's birthday. I was a little annoyed at the invasion of privacy at first, but more irate that Grant had kept this SHM clue from me. After a brief and admittedly genuine apology, Grant opened up one of the laptops. He pulled a USB drive out his pocket and plugged it in. When I asked why he hadn't just used my PC if he had the clip on a thumb drive, he muttered something about not wanting to buy me a new monitor. I understood exactly what he meant once he'd played me the clip.\n\nThis probably is no shock to any of you, but the three-minute snippet was of the end of our final DnD session. It was the video of Doug's Mom dying. It wasn't raw footage though. Grant had edited it. Specifically, he'd slowed it down to a tenth of the original speed. The three-minute clip represented only about twenty seconds of real-time footage. It was enough. Grant had found all we needed to *prove* SHM was a hokum made-up bullshit disease to cover up something else happening.\n\nDespite what you're thinking, it didn't feel like a victory. I've never felt worse about being proved right. The \"something else\" was so far outside the realms of my explanation that trying to understand what I was watching literally gave me a migraine. All I remember thinking when the clip finished was that I'd give *anything* to wake up in a reality where I'd been wrong.\n\nOnce more I was watching Doug standing over his Mom in his kitchen. He was moving at super-slow speeds, as to be expected. She *wasn't.* She was still shaking, but it was *shaking* now, *not* blur-inducing vibrations. Her speed was still faster than it should have been but, thanks to Grant's editing, we could see what she was actually doing down there. She was writhing, kicking, flexing every joint in her body with jolting spasms that bent them into contortionist-like angles. To my disgust, I realized that what I'd thought was the natural crack and pop of slowed audio was *actually* the snapping and crunching of bones and cartilage. More than once she'd twist into a position that showed more than just her ankles. We saw her legs, saw the flesh on them shrink away in a matter of seconds. We'd catch glimpses of her hands, of the skin around her digits vacuum-sealing the bones so tightly that fingernails splintered and cracked. Only once did we see her face. It was one time too many.\n\nShe'd spasmed forward, folding inward without warning until her temples touched her toes. Her eyes were\u2026 they were burning. Bright green flames poured from her sockets, the black orbs at their center bubbling and sputtering with intense heat. The skin of her face was pulled so tight that pulsing veins around her eyes seemed to dance and writhe above the skin. She was screaming, too. Screaming with such force that the windpipe in her shrinking neck bulged and her wilting tonsils bled. Her jaw was open long past that point that it should have dislocated. That's when I realized what the weird audio spike had been when I'd seen the footage months earlier, when it was live and at normal speed.\n\nIt was Doug's Mom screams, sped up so fast they sounded like microphone feedback.\n\nWith the footage slowed down it was *clearly* audible. Garbled and distorted, sure, but there was no mistaking the stretched, tinny shrieks cascading from the laptop speaker. It wasn't a scream of fear, but of pain. Unrestrained, unreserved agony. It was when Doug started to bend over in super-slow motion that my stomach dropped. I remembered his fingers, the power-sander sound that reminded me of Freddy Gruber's elbow in 6th grade.\n\nWith the footage slowed, Doug's attempts to save his mother sounded *nothing* like a power sander. It sounded like lightning. The moment the tips of his fingers were within six-or-so inches of the top of her head there was an almighty *crack*, a booming thunder so loud that the speakers screamed for a few seconds before falling silent. Twin streams of emerald flame leaped from Doug's Mom's boiling, hissing eyes the moment the hardware-killing noise hit. The green fire wrapped around Doug's slow-motion fingers. The moment they made contact the flesh of his digits curled and split, falling away in fluttering shreds that cascaded back towards his Mom's black hole eyes. Within a few seconds, there was nothing left but bone, and below long that too was lost in the bubbling voids.\n\nDoug had pulled his hand away quickly, so I knew he didn't lose more than a few fingers.  Still, the tension caused by watching him (from our slowed perspective) holding his hand in that acid-like green burning had me grinding my teeth so hard that I lost a filling. The relief I felt when he finally pulled his hand away was short-lived, however. The worst of Grant's discovery was yet to come. That's the moment that *they* arrived.\n\nI can't describe them to you because I've not actually seen them. Neither has Grant. That's the thing though, you *can*'*t.* The way you can't see them though? That I can describe real fucking clear, even though thinking about it too long makes me so queasy that I nearly puke.\n\nI didn't notice them at first. They started small, three clusters of fuzzy darkness hovering at Doug's feet. Within a few frames though they were as tall as his knees and wider as he was. In other words, impossible to ignore. The panic riding my breathing grew louder and louder as the three beings unfurled. Once materialized at their full height they were easily 9ft tall, the very peaks of the conical heads brushing the ceiling of Doug's Mom's lofty rustic kitchen. At first, I thought they were dark, shadowy, the same intense blackness that\u2026 haha... \"SHM\" left the eyes of every single victim. That's when Grant reached forward, paused the video, and minimized the window. I stared at the generic desktop wallpaper, my jaw falling open and closed. I sputtered, trying to get words out. All my mouth could find was shrill nonsensical gibberish.\n\nThe three figures were still there. The pixels of their forms weren't displaying darkness. They were dead.\n\nI peered down to look closer. Sure enough, the backlight of the screen was completely gone where the figures stood. The pixels at the edges of the silhouettes, the ones that should have been displaying the clear blues and greens of a rolling hill, flickered and glitched. They cycled through every color visible to the naked eye (not to mention some that shouldn't have been, although *please* don't ask me to elaborate on this because if I think about it too much it literally triggers an epileptic fit, no teenage hyperbole).\n\nIt was at this point that Grant started frantically booting up the rest of the laptops. On the screens of every single one were three identical clusters of dead pixels outlined by a maddening razor-thin spectrum of maddening color. Whatever these things were, capturing their likeness and displaying it digitally was too much for manmade electronics. Grant proved this by showing me his phone, which he'd used to film one of the laptops while it played the video. There, on his home screen, were three miniature clusters of lightless pixels with conical heads. Figures that aligned perfectly with the aforementioned video when he tapped it open with his thumb a few seconds later.\n\nI was babbling and shaking by this point. There were more than a few tears, let's put it that way. Grant wasn't done yet though. The clip still wasn't finished.\n\nThe last twenty seconds of the clip were of the three figures towering over Doug. They didn't move, but I could tell they must have been doing *something* behind their shroud of pixel death. I know for two reasons. I'll get through the *least* harrowing of them first, because for the second I need to build myself up a little. The first reason I knew the conical-headed giants were there for a reason was Doug's Mom. She was convulsing more violently than ever. Her spasms were rocketing her from the floor so hard that she seemed almost to be floating toward the three dark masses. Well, perhaps pulled toward them is more appropriate. Pulled by her bubbling, boiling, black-hole eyes.\n\nThe green flames had once more leaped from them. This time though there were three tendrils of fire, and thankfully none of them found Doug. Instead, they snaked their way through the air until they each found a mass of pixel death. The flames disappeared behind their respective voids, and to my growing horror, I realized they were at the *exact height* one would expect to find, on a 9ft conical-headed being, a mouth. The arcs of green fire kept Doug's Mom and the dead pixel figures connected until almost the very end of the clip. Her convulsions grew more violent and contorting than ever. Her skin rippled as the final ounces of fat, muscle, and mass were sucked into those void-filled orbs to be burned into green flames. Every vein on her face bulged to bursting point. Her mouth twisted into a teeth-baring grimace from which streaks of foam oozed. Doug stood above his Mom, still slow-motion and oblivious, as the three towering beings around him consumed her until she was little more than an abyss-eyed skeleton draped in papery skin.\n\nAs I said though, that was the *first* of the two reasons I knew those beings must have been doing something beneath those lifeless pixels. The *second* one, the one that's kept me up for however many nights have passed since that morning, was much worse.\n\nI could *hear* them.\n\nNot through the speaker. The speaker was dead, busted. This was made all too apparent by the fact that Doug's Mom's electric-chair convulsions and screaming from burning eyes had been inaudible since Doug made the mistake of trying to touch her. No. I could hear them in the room. From all around me, their hollow tones echoed and bounced off every wall. I yelled, whipping around in every direction, adrenaline shooting through every blood vessel. Grant was crying now, crying and mouthing *\"I'm sorry*\" over and over like a twisted mantra. It wasn't just the fact that I could hear them which made me throw the laptop out the damn window. It was what I could hear them doing, too.\n\nThey were laughing. All three of them were locked in high-pitched, chittering hysterics. The kind of laughter you imagine a spider makes before it injects its cocooned prey with chemicals that turn them into liquid mulch. Every barked *ha* screeched through my eardrums, twisting my spine and setting off every nervous tic I never knew I had.\n\nI shouted at Grant for about half an hour once I was satisfied the laptop hadn't survived the fall. He took it like a champ, and when I'd finally calmed down he showed me the bloodied knuckles he'd obtained when he put his fist through drywall after watching it the first time. The fear it created\u2026 was *beyond* rationality. Hearing that laughter set off something deep within me, a set of emotions long-dormant thanks to the comfortable safety of modern life. Once upon a time, human beings *needed* that mix of aggression and panic. They needed it because, if they *didn't* have it, they'd never be able to fight their way out of the corners the beings that live in shadows could back them into. I know those feelings now, although *every single part* of me wishes that I didn't.\n\nIt was after I apologized for losing my cool, and Grant began to talk about our options for what to do next, that our phones rang. I felt the little composure I'd managed to build since the laptop went flying ebb away in an instant. There was no number, but instead of \"caller not recognized\" or \"withheld number\", the writing on the screen showed two simple, spirit-crushing words.\n\n\"humAn phone\"\n\nI looked up at Grant, tears once more falling down my cheeks. He was in the same state. He nodded at me, and I gulped, resigning myself to whatever happened next. We both clicked the green icon to accept the call. A single voice answered, and once more it came not from our phones but from every square inch of space around us. It was a single voice, whining and high-pitched. The syllables sounded not like organic speech, but like someone had stretched and manipulated audio of billions of people screaming until it became coherent language. Again, only two words, but they were enough for both Grant and I to get on our bikes and cycle as far away from my house as we possibly could.\n\n\"hellO boys.\"\n\nMy folks were the ones who reported us missing. They found us hiding in our shack in the woods, that one we'd na\u00efvely believed our parents didn't know about. It was when we started to explain *why* we ran that shit went sideways fast.\n\nWe'd expected the cops not to believe us. We never thought they'd place us under house arrest and cut both our houses off from the internet. We were both dumbfounded when they confiscated our phones and told us every device we owned was getting taken in for evidence. We were *real fucking surprised* when one of the cops punched Grant in the face and told us, in no uncertain terms, that just because we were kids didn't mean we wouldn't get, and I quote, \"dealt with\".\n\nWhen I found out about the bribe money to keep shtum I don't know what I felt more; shocked at how much it was, or disgusted that my parents accepted it. They don't believe me, by the way. They're pissed that we tried to leave town at, and again I quote but from my Dad now, \"*a time when the community needs to come together and not do anything to rock the boat.\"*\n\nThat was a week ago. I haven't slept since. I also haven't heard from Grant. I've been watching the news though. 17 more have gone in the last five days. 17 more people burned away and consumed by\u2026 by whatever those things are. And our police, at the very least, are in on it. Keeping it covered up\u2026 not *just* keeping it covered up, *allowing* it to happen. I *know* it runs deeper though. It *has* to. Why else would those scientists in hazmat suits keep showing up outside my house at night? Why else would a black van be parked across the street morning, noon, and night? Why fucking else would three police officers resign due citing \"a conflict of conscience\" and die under \"mysterious\" circumstances the night afterward?\n\nWhatever's happening in my town, it's big, and it's being kept quiet. Not only kept quiet, it's being *allowed* to happen. I stole my Dad's work phone to post this. I'm hoping that it gets out there, that it makes it past the blacklist they've got in place. That's part of the reason I've omitted the name of where I actually live, they'll no doubt have scrapers mining every search engine for it. I mean fuck, it probably won't work, but I'm plum out of ideas and, honestly, *way beyond* desperate by this point.\n\nThis isn't a \"send help now\" post, because the \"help\" is half the fucking problem. This is so you can be on the alert. If you get wind of *anything* that sounds even *remotely* like SHM, skip town. Leave. Especially if you live in a pokey little cult-like \"quiet town\" like mine. I don't care what you think of your neighbors. Forget everything you know about your friends, your family. When shit hits the fan they *will* play along with the lie.\n\nAs I said, this doesn't seem to have spread beyond the town limits so far. Whatever those beings are, they've picked here as their hunting ground. They could move though, or there could be more of them. Who knows how many ghost towns and dwindling populations are actually whole communities being deliberately fed to these things?! The US is a BIG place. You really think anyone would notice if Podunkville in Shit-Heap County vanished slowly over a few years?\n\nThat's what's happening here, and nobody around me is trying to stop it. My parents, the news, the police, the mayor, everyone with any kind of authority are doing what they can to make sure we sit tight and let it happen. There's no such thing as Spontaneous Human Malnutrition. There never has been and there never will be, but because the idiots around me refuse to stop insisting otherwise I'm going to get consumed by\u2026\n\nNo. Fuck it. Fuck the house arrest. I can't stay here. Those things know who I am, know where I am. They'll be coming for me sooner or later. House arrest be damned. I've got nowhere to go but, Jesus Christ, that footage. Dying alone and starving in the forest would be much better than\u2026 than that.\n\nDad, if you're reading this, I'm sorry. I don't want to know what it feels like to have eyes that burn like dying suns. I'm not going out the way Doug's Mom did, the way I know you're hiding from me that Grant already has done. I can't take this madness anymore Dad. You know I'm right about all this. I am sorry, I truly am, but you and I both need to accept that it's *not my fault* you decided to fall down this rabbit hole.\n\nAs for the rest of you, wish me luck. You might see me cycling through your town one day. Who knows. I'm posting this then hitting the road. It's about an hour's journey between my house and the edge of town. If I push it I can make it before my Dad or the cops realize what I've done. I'm taking a risk by posting this I know, but that's the thing. There's always a chance those things might reach me first. Hell, they might even be reading this now. They've already proved they can mess with our phones. It wouldn't be a stretch if they were watching me type this right\u2026\n\nNo. Can't think like that. Got to focus, got to remember that as risky as leaving is, the risk of staying is always higher. It's a certainty. I'm going to be keeping my head down so you won't hear from me again, but keep your fingers crossed for me. Please.\n\nOh, and remember, if and when your local Chip Dallas facsimile starts telling you not to worry about a mysterious new disease called Spontaneous Human Malnutrition, don't believe a word they say. It doesn't exist, and you have every reason to panic.","9":"I'm a little unsure of where to post this, so I hope I've got the right subreddit, I really have to know if I'm totally in the wrong in this situation.\n\nSo my wonderful friend Clara had her wedding today. It's a little odd to have a wedding on a Thursday evening in November, I know, but it makes her happy and who am I to deny someone happiness? Anyway, she's been planning a whirlwind wedding, they only got engaged in August, so everything has been a little mad for the last couple of months.\n\nI was elated when she asked me to be her one and only bridesmaid. I know it's a huge thing for her, and I am desperate to do right by her. Or was desperate anyway. She did the cutest little proposal for it where she gave me an absolutely gorgeous garnet bracelet with a small bottle of champagne when she asked and I've been devoted to making this day a perfect day for her and her fiance Harold. They are the cutest couple.\n\nI'm going to try and hurry, I just thought you would need some backstory as to why I've been so keen on making sure Clara's day is exactly as she wants it.\n\nClara's always been a huge dog lover too, and many of her closest guests have dogs, so she's made a point to ask everyone to bring them and RSVP when they are so she has enough seats. She wanted to try and have a dog-person-dog seating arrangement while she walked down the aisle. Her sister Elizabeth and I have been so excited to bring our dogs.\n\nElizabeth and I are also friends, and she's always habitually late to everything. Since I'm always early and we're both key members for the Bride's Big Day, I took the responsibility to make sure Elizabeth would arrive on time by planning on picking her and her little black Scottish Terrier up and bringing them with me and my bulldog mutt to the venue, which is Clara and Elizabeth's parents' farm about an hour's drive north.\n\nSo fast forward to today, I go to pick up Elizabeth at her house around 11:30 am so we have time to make it in case of traffic, since we have to be there by 1 PM. When I got there I left my boy, Larry in the car since it's a cool day and I'm only supposed to take a little bit. I left the window cracked and he's got a cozy blanket to snuggle into at all times, don't come for me. So I went up to her door and knocked and rang the doorbell and waited for her to come answer. Like five minutes pass, and I figure she must just be running late like normal. I could hear her little scottie, Devil, barking at the door, so I grabbed her hide-a-key rock and let myself in.\n\nNaturally, Devil's all over me and his whole little body is rocking back and forth with his ferociously wagging tail. He had his little bowtie that matchs Larry's on and I didn't see Elizabeth anywhere. I figured she must have been in the bathroom or like napping or something so I started looking for her. I checked like everywhere except the basement. Her bulb burnt out in the basement forever ago, so it's very dark. Plus her basement is unfinished, super creepy, and has like nothing down there so there is no reason she would have been there.\n\nSo like 15 minutes went by and the traffic list on my phone says it's starting to get rough, and I have to get going so I'm not late. I felt like such a jerk, but I got Devil all leashed up and sent a text to Elizabeth to let her know I was leaving and she should catch up. I didn't even see her car when I got there, so she might have been on her way anyway.\n\nWith Devil and Larry all loaded up and safe, we got going to the venue. When I got there with the dogs I let Clara know what happened and apologized since I had sworn I would get her sister there and I totally dropped the ball. Clara figured Elizabeth had spent the night at her girlfriend's or something and would just be late like always. With the rehearsal, getting ready, trying to set up all the decorations, and handling a minor mascara scare we didn't even have time to notice Elizabeth's absence until after the wedding and into the reception anyway. Side bar, Clara was absolutely stunning in her sparkly white dress with a class little tiara, I loved the way it looked against her burgundy theme.\n\nSo it's getting a little late, and even now it's pretty late as I write. I ran out to my car to grab Jackets while Clara stepped out for some air. Right after I shut my car door with the puppy coats in hand, I notice something in the dark starting to kind of, I don't know, shamble? Toward the farm house where we're all living up the celebration of love. As it got closer, Clara was the first one to really get what it was and she let out a high squeal of joy, which started bringing the guests out onto the wrap-around porch as the bride flew down the stairs like a ghost toward the now clearer shape of Elizabeth.\n\nBefore Clara reached her, I noticed something was completely off about Elizabeth. First, the dogs had come out and Devil was hiding behind me growling instead of running at his missing owner. Devil loves Elizabeth so this is super weird. Second, Elizabeth usually has gorgeous amber curls that shine in the littlest bit of light, and her hair is dull and looks kind of crusty.\n\nAnd possibly the creepiest thing is that Elizabeth was walking on her ankles. Like her feet were at a right angle to the ground. It looked so painful. So there's Clara, running arms outstretched to hug get sister who's just shambling towards everyone and when Clara threw her arms around her sister, everyone just aww'd. It was super sweet, though also creepy because like Elizabeth is not right. Something is so creepy about her. Probably the feet thing.\n\nAfter a second, Clara just crumpled to the ground. The whole crowd and I just gasped and everything stood still for a second. Until Elizabeth started coming towards me. Me! Of all people. Clara and Elizabeth's mom let out a scream while Elizabeth started making guttural noises. Everyone on the porch started rushing to get back inside, scared out of their wits. Cell phones lit up, trying to call the police for help.\n\nAnd I heard Elizabeth, in a guttural, angry voice talking to me. I'm going to just try and write exactly what she said; \"You....left...me. He...in the basement...had me...I...needed you...needed...help...you left me to die...\"\n\nI still have no idea what she was talking about. I tried to get her! I couldn't hear anything in that house but Devil excited to see me! Her basement is SO CREEPY.\n\nBut whatever, I was super freaked by then and I threw open my still-unlocked car door. The dogs jumped inside and I followed as fast as I could. Both dogs just coward on the passenger seat as I gunned it as fast as I could out there. Elizabeth following my car with her weird dead eyes as I did.\n\nI'm a few miles away now, writing this in a parking lot on my phone. The dogs are still shaking. I have no idea what to do. Do I go back and apologize? Am I like the biggest dick for leaving? I just wanted Clara's day to be perfect!\n\nAnyway, please let me know. I'll do my best to respond when I calm down a little later, so please be patient with me.","10":" [\\[Part 1\\]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qq83wq\/lost_in_a_snowstorm_i_have_stumbled_into_an\/) \n\n [\\[Part 2\\]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qr5i9i\/lost_in_a_snowstorm_i_have_stumbled_into_an\/) \n\n **WARNING:** Story contains details of and discussion of **suicide**. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI step forwards and through the shimmering gate of the mirror. I am again surrounded by mists and swirling, crystalline smoke and again my footing is lost. I grit my teeth through the fall and stumble to my side as the hard, cold ground finds its place beneath my feet. I knock into a boy besides me and he grunts with surprise.\n\n\u201cHey watch where you\u2019re going, alright?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry\u201d, I tell him, straightening and putting out an apologetic hand as I check to confirm my surroundings.\n\nThe sun\u2019s position has changed back to the way it was.

Sorry, do I know you?\u201d\n\n*Ah, shoot.*\n\n\u201cNo, um, I mean yeah, you do. My name\u2019s Sam, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m in the year above you\u201d.\n\nShe wrinkles her nose. \u201c\u2026No, you aren\u2019t. Do you even go to this school?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, right. Just kidding. I\u2019m new. Sorry. I thought we\u2019d met before, but, maybe someone just told me your name, sorry\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is an awkward pause.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*What the hell is wrong with me? Stop apologising, Sam.*\n\n\u201cOkay, well, nice to meet you\u201d. She grimaces and strides right past me.\n\nI fume to myself, quietly. *You\u2019ve fucked this already, you idiot. Well screw it, in for a penny, in for a pound, as they say.*\n\nI put out my hands. \u201cAlright, you got me. You know what Ellie, I\u2019m not in the year above and I\u2019m not a new kid either. We met earlier this evening and you were *dead*. A ghost. I\u2019m now trying to save you. This is the second time I\u2019ve played through this school day\u201d.\n\nShe glances over her shoulder at me but does not slow her pace. She laughs awkwardly. \u201cOkay, great. Sorry I really need to go\u201d.\n\n\u201c8G, right? Good news, I\u2019m coming with you!\u201d\n\nShe clutches her books a little tighter to her chest as she weaves between the taller kids in the corridor.\n\nI put a hand on her shoulder. It\u2019s soft, and warm, but she flinches away from my touch. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t touch me\u201d, she says quickly.\n\n\u201cRight, sure, sorry- but look, please just hear me out! I know what you\u2019ve written in your journal! In the purple one! You\u2019ve written out your last day- you\u2019ve got bullet points for \u2018apologise to Mrs Reeves\u2019, and for \u2018clear out locker\u2019-\u201d\n\nShe stares at me again as we arrive at the door to 8G. \u201cHow do you know that!? Are you some kind of a stalker? What do you WANT?\u201d\n\n\u201cI WANT you to not commit suicide when you go home from school, Ellie, okay! *That\u2019s what I want!*\u201d\n\nI say this a little too loudly. Hush falls in the corridor as faces turn to ours, and it takes a long, strained moment before the conversations resume, in a lower tone than they had before. Ellie fumes.\n\n\u201cWhy did you have to say that\u201d, she hisses, as her eyes start to water and her cheeks flush. \u201cMy life is none of your concern. Just go away. Please\u201d. And with this she turns and pushes through the door into the classroom, and after a beat, I follow.\n\nThe same spiel plays out as before. Mrs Reeves asks me to introduce myself to the class, though this time I remember to say my own name. And further, since it\u2019s neither recommended by the teacher, nor does Ellie seem in any kind of mood now to engage with me, I decide to give her a little space, and sit instead next to the only other free seat in the room, next to a girl on the opposite side.\n\n\u201cHey\u201d, she says as I sit down.\n\n\u201cHey\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo where are you from, new kid?\u201d\n\nI tell her, and she shrugs. \u201cOh, I thought you might have been from Australia\u201d.\n\nI hesitate. \n\n\u201c\u2026Why would I be from *Australia?\u201d*\n\nShe shrugs and goes back to doodling in her book. \u201cThere was a rumour that we were getting a new kid from Australia is all. Shame. I really like the accent\u201d.\n\nThere is another pause as I process this nonsense, then I chuckle awkwardly. \u201cRight\u2026 You did just hear me speak though, in front of the class\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t really listening\u201d she says airily.\n\n\u201cRight\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSilence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMrs Reeves reads through the register and I tap my knuckles against the desk, then gesture over to Ellie. \u201cSo what\u2019s her deal then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cEllie\u201d.\n\nThe girl beside me looks up at once, eyes sparkling and eyebrows raised. She puts down her pen and smirks. \u201cDo you like her?\u201d\n\nI flush, and try not to respond to this directly. \u201cI was just wondering, is all\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe would definitely date you if you asked. That\u2019s adorable. Bit of warning for you though new kid, I wouldn\u2019t go there. She\u2019s not exactly someone worth associating with\u201d.\n\n\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d I reply, bristled. The girl shrugs.\n\n\u201cI mean, you can if you want, but, why bother? It\u2019s not like she\u2019s interesting or anything. But hey it\u2019s a free country, so do what you want I guess\u201d.\n\nI look back to Ellie. She sits quietly with her chin in her hand, staring ahead at nothing in particular.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA long and slithering shadow is sent swimming across the room. I feel the seat and the desk rumble as it passes by, but no-one else in the room seems to notice. I swivel in my seat to look behind me through the windows at the back of the class, but\u2026 there is nothing there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy neighbour looks at me, amused. \u201cYou\u2019re strange\u201d, she says simply.\n\n\u201cMm-hmm\u201d, I reply, still looking through the window for evidence of the watchful, waiting monstrosity.\n\nBut the bell rings, and the morning begins, and it goes in much the same way as it did last time, with a few key differences.\n\nFirstly there\u2019s no pretence on my part. I am 100% honest with Ellie.\n\n\u201cI walked through a mirror to get here\u201d, I tell her in the first lesson of day, whispering to her from the seat behind. \u201cI\u2019m not joking. This is the second time I\u2019m living through the day; honestly, the teacher\u2019s going to use an example from his home life in a minute, listen-\u201d\n\nWe do so, and sure enough the guy starts trying to link the subject matter back to a semi-amusing anecdote from his week. Ellie glances over her shoulder at me. \u201cYou\u2019re freaking me the hell out. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to do but please, stop\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019ve been speaking to your ghost, Ellie. I know you love mechanics and how things work- watches and stuff. You need to listen to me\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is insane\u201d she hisses back. \u201cWho have you been talking to? This is cruel\u201d.\n\nI release a breath of frustration through my nose. \u201cWHY would you want to commit suicide? I don\u2019t get it! Your life doesn\u2019t seem that bad to me, please, don\u2019t do this\u201d.\n\n\u201cFuck OFF\u201d.\n\nAnd with that she turns around and ignores me for the remainder of the lesson, then sprints away the second the bell is rang.\n\nI run my hands through my hair. \n\n*This shit is not working. Maybe I should just do as she says. Just give up and leave her be.*\n\nI wonder what she\u2019s doing now. Ghost Ellie. If she\u2019s watching me, somehow. Or if she\u2019s playing around with the watch\u2026 Or sitting alone, huddled in that cold, dark room as the monsters close in\u2026\n\nI clench and unclench my fingers.\n\nI am here for a purpose. I didn\u2019t just stumble onto this school by chance. There is a reason, there must be a reason, and Ellie can be saved. I\u2019m sure of it.\n\nSo I keep on trying.\n\nSecond lesson I give her a bit of space and try to come up with a plan. I\u2019m struggling to think, though, as my eyes feel heavier and heavier with every blink. \n\nI have lost track of time, and my body clock is all sorts of screwed up right about now. I put my head down in my hands on the desk, just for a minute, and try to think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see in my mind\u2019s eye the swirling shadows of the eels. Eyes glowing in the wintery gloom as the snow cascades all around. I see Ellie, her hair rippling gently as if underwater. She looks back at me sadly as she rises up and out of my reach into the storm\u2026\n\n\u2026I see myself in the blizzard; I see the dark and emptied school collapse all around me and caught in the gale. I see the lights of the streetlamps go out one by one as the monsters close the distance. Their jaws crack open with a hiss of icy steam\u2026 and I am jerked awake from my dreams by a shake of my shoulder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201c\u2026It\u2019s Sam, isn\u2019t it\u201d, says the teacher, an eyebrow raised as I blink away my sleep. I can hear some of the other students giggling. \u201cI can only apologise if my lesson has quite literally bored you to sleep, but do try to stay alert, thank you\u201d.\n\nI nod apologetically and the teacher returns to the front of the class. I look immediately over to Ellie, but her eyes are downcast. Determination runs through me like a river.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Save her.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am able to follow her to lunch, this time. She does not escape through the crowds, and so I watch as she gets her food and takes it to a table outside, in the sun. It\u2019s still pretty cold, but I guess it\u2019s where she\u2019d rather be.\n\nI take a seat not far away, but one out of her immediate line of sight as I try to plan my next move. I suppress a yawn and mull over my options, and as I do\u2026\n\n\u2026A group of kids approach her. Two boys, three girls. Ellie is not looking, but the group are clearly egging each other on. I can\u2019t hear what they\u2019re saying but one of the girls is shaking her head and laughing. I watch as another of them raises a plastic-bottle and unclasps the lid, as the bottle is aimed and the first girl suddenly reaches over and squeezes the plastic between her hands\u2026 and a stream of water is blasted right into the side of Ellie\u2019s face, down her clothes and over her food.\n\nAnd the worst part for me is the fact that she doesn\u2019t say a damned thing. She stays totally quiet as the group laughs. \u201cOh my God!\u201d one of the girls says, \u201cI\u2019m so *sorry!* It wasn\u2019t me, it was Karina! She did it!\u201d and they keep laughing amongst themselves, passing blame as they make a quick and gleeful exit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2026Ellie only sits there in silence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get up at once to go over and see if she\u2019s okay. \u201cHey\u201d, I say as I get closer. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s clear as I draw near that it wasn\u2019t water sprayed over her, based on the smell that rises thick and strong. -It\u2019s vinegar.\n\n\u201cJesus\u2026\u201d I mutter as I stand there beside her, awkwardly. \u201cThat\u2019s messed up\u201d.\n\nEllie says nothing. Her eyes are covered by her fringe but her cheeks are a deep scarlet, and she grabs up her back and strides suddenly off, leaving her ruined lunch behind. \n\n\u201cHey wait! Are you alright? Ellie!\u201d I call after her, but she sprints away into the building and disappears round a corner.\n\n\u201cGodamnit!\u201d I shout out to no-one in particular. A gust of sudden wind rustles my collar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd so the day goes on. Ellie misses the next lesson, as she did on the first \u2018playthrough\u2019\u2026 though I know why, this time.\n\nAnd when she finally returns to English, the last lesson of the day, I feel my chest tightening as I realise that once again my time is running short. I head right over to her and she takes a step back at my approach, frustrating me further. \u201cEllie I\u2019m not your enemy here for fuck\u2019s sake\u201d, I say to her, \u201cplease, just hear me out! You\u2019re going to be picked on to read a passage aloud today, so, maybe just read it over a few times in advance as practice. Act 4 scene\u2026 4, I think it was\u201d.\n\nShe squints at me, as if trying to read me. Searching for something inside, perhaps, and I wait patiently for an accusation or insult\u2026 But she says nothing. She simply sighs and walks right past to her seat. I am struck, and not for the first time, by an ethereal kind of deep sadness, one that troubles and dismays me as it washes over me.\n\nAnd as it happens\u2026 my advice was useless anyway. Ellie never gets to read out a section of Shakespeare. As the time draws near, instead of watching Ellie get called upon, the Headteacher instead opens up the classroom door. The heads of all the students turns to look, and he calls Ellie out from the lesson. The class falls into a hushed silence as she gathers her things and steps outside\u2026 and after another minute or two, I excuse myself to the \u2018bathroom\u2019, and set off in pursuit.\n\nIt takes me a good five minutes to locate the Head\u2019s office, but once I do I crack the door, cringing as I do so and hoping not to be discovered\u2026 and I listen in.\n\n\u201c\u2026very troubling, Ellie\u201d, comes the voice of the Head, then he pauses, but there is no response from the girl in question. He speaks on:\n\n\u201cWe take threats of suicide very seriously, young lady. Very seriously indeed. Now I wasn\u2019t there this morning and I don\u2019t know exactly what was said-\u201d\n\nI grimace and think back on what I blurted out to Ellie in front of all those people.\n\n\u201c-but it\u2019s important that we talk through this. You can always rely on us here-\u201d\n\nEllie snorts humourlessly.\n\nThe Head clears his throat and continues. \u201c\u2026And we have arranged for you to speak with the school\u2019s counsellor tomorrow morning; this will continue for as long as necessary. I will also of course need to inform your parents-\u201d\n\nEllie changes her tune here. I can sense the sudden desperation in her voice as she begs: \u201cNo Sir, please, don\u2019t call my parents! Please! It was just a dumb joke, Sir, honestly! You don\u2019t need to call them! Please, don\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry Ellie, but\u2026 I have a duty of care\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd with this Ellie breaks down. My guilt is sharp as she cries behind the door, and I take my leave.\n\nWhat\u2019s the damned point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI return to English and wait for her to come back, but she does not.\n\nThen at the end of the day I am again waiting by the steps to the school, at 2:59. There goes Ellie. She walks right by with her backpack full. I call out to her and she picks up the pace.\n\nThe air grows thick.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d, I mutter out loud. \u201cNot again, please-\u201d\n\nA gust of wind ruffles through my hair and rustles the collar of my coat. \n\nIt\u2019s becoming harder to speak out. I am forced to project to raise my voice beyond a whisper\u2026\n\n\u2026And there\u2019s that sensation again\u2026 that feeling of walking through water.\n\nI struggle against the winds and the thickness of its air; the lowering sun glints orange and sends Ellie\u2019s shadow long and dark back towards me as the gap between us widens\u2026\n\n\u2026And all around us return the eels. Slow, yet rumbling they push aside the air as they form from mist and shadow. They look down to the girl, hungry and eyes a-glow. They are closer, this time. One looks over to me. Its hazy yellow eye meets mine.\n\n\u2026And the clouds shimmer behind and beside. I am lost within it as I call out for her, but my voice simply does not work in this moment. My sight is obscured and I close my eyes tight shut. When I open them again\u2026\n\n\u2026I am stumbling to the floor of the classroom. I trip and crash into a nearby desk with a grunt and grab hold of the counter beside me for balance. It takes a second or two for the world to stop spinning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI catch my breath, and watch as Ellie plays with her holograph of the watch. She carefully moves a gear into a new location. I wait for her to speak, and eventually she does.\n\nShe winks and sticks her tongue out at me. \u201cNo luck again, huh?\u201d\n\nI am met with a sudden anger and I rise up to full height. \u201cWhat the hell is *wrong with you!?* This isn\u2019t a GAME! I\u2019m trying to save your LIFE!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to do a damned THING!\u201d she shouts back, \u201cwhy do you even care so much about me?\u201d\n\nI throw out my hands, \u201cwhat do you *want*, Ellie? Do you want these things to get you? These eels in the sky? What even ARE they? Do you WANT to be saved?\u201d\n\nEllie makes an \u2018ooh\u2019 sound. \u201cWhat a big hero we have over here\u201d, she says sarcastically. \u201cBig hero wants to save the poor suicidal girl. Well it\u2019s too late. My decision was made and hell, I don\u2019t regret it. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s done. It\u2019s done and I feel great\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou feel GREAT?\u201d\n\nShe shrugs. \u201cSure. Why not. I\u2019m not scared. I\u2019m not afraid. I\u2019m not terrified about what\u2019s going to happen next. There is no \u2018next\u2019. I\u2019m free, Sam. \u2026I\u2019m free\u201d.\n\n\u201cWell if that\u2019s true\u201d, I say, \u201cthen why not just let those things outside come and get you? Why not leave the building and let them take you wherever. Then you\u2019ll truly be gone. Gone forever, I guess. Or wherever they take you. If they\u2019re even supposed to be here at all\u2026\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo this, Ellie says nothing. She just brushes a strand of hair behind her ear, and she looks out the window.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2026The room, I suddenly realise, appears smaller than it was before.\n\nThe desks and chairs are more closely clumped and the shadows are darker.\n\nThe students\u2019 paintings hung up and across the walls\u2026 were their colours always so dark? And some of them\u2026 the self-portraits\u2026 the eyes no longer look as they did. The lines and the scratches in the paint appear more pronounced\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2026The snowstorm rages\u2026\n\n\u2026and the monsters drift through the wind.","11":"Hello, my name is Matthew and I\u2019m addicted to drugs. I have been sober for 60 days now, I even got my little coin for it. I woke up this morning and grabbed my phone to type this out because I want to be rid of all of this. So I wanted to tell everyone a story. A story about the last time I got fucked up and why I stopped using ever since. I used drugs to run away and I\u2019m just so tired of running away\u2026\n\nI\u2019ll spare you the sad details of my life that led me astray to abusing all sorts of substances just to feel good. Man do I miss that feeling...just being able to lose myself. The things I\u2019ve seen, the experiences I\u2019ve had while I wasn\u2019t...here\u2026.ugh...sorry. Anyways, this all happened a few months ago when I got a text from my friend, Bill. I called him a friend but we barely knew each other. I met him at a drug house I was in and we just kept in touch, he knew where to get the craziest shit. \n\nBill had texted me an address alongside a \u201cmind-blown\u201d emoji. I couldn\u2019t help but laugh as I messaged him back to ask what he had gotten himself into. He was telling me a friend of a friend of a friend of his had gotten ahold of some experimental drug that apparently gave a very different kind of experience. He didn\u2019t know any other details but he assured me we were going to have a great time. I just couldn\u2019t resist, so I hopped on the bus and made my way to him. \n\nIt took about forty or so minutes to get to my destination in front of an old apartment building. Bill was sitting on the steps of the stoop and shot up to greet me. He grinned at me as he exclaimed how excited he was to see me, it seemed like he had lost a couple of more teeth since the last time I saw him. Bill opened the door and directed me inside, it was really quiet and dimly lit inside. He stepped in front of me and guided me up the stairwell. \n\nWe walked up three flights up stairs to our destination, all the while I couldn\u2019t help but feel uncomfortable with the silence. We are in an apartment building in the city but it\u2019s deathly quiet here. I managed to brush off my discomfort when we made it to the door of unit 3-C. Bill patted his hair down and put on a big goofy smile before tapping on the door. A few minutes pass when a woman opens the door. \n\nThe woman was really attractive, fair skinned with short red hair dressed in a black jeans and some metal band shirt. \n\n\u201cH-Hi there, Uh..We\u2019re here!\u201d Bill blurted out nervously. The woman turned to me, her lips parted to reveal a beautiful smile. \n\n\u201cIs this the friend you\u2019ve been talking about?\u201d she said, her voice sounded so sweet in my ears \n\nBill nudged my shoulder, \u201cOh right, I\u2019m Matthew. Nice to meet you.\u201d \n\n\u201cC\u2019mon in.\u201d she said as she opened the door for us, \u201cHave a seat on the couch.\u201d\n\nI looked around to see a pretty average looking apartment, picture frames on the beige walls, a single pleather couch in the living room, carpet flooring, and very standard decor. It was really clean in here, almost too clean. When I glanced over at one of the pictures on a small side table I noticed that it's just a stock photo\u2026.weird. I sat on the couch along with Bill and I looked over to him. He sat there with his back completely straight like an attentive school boy, I could see what he was trying to do and I just laughed to myself. \n\nThe woman sat on the floor in front of us holding a small box. \u201cSo did Billy here tell you about what\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked as she opened the box and started sifting through it. \n\n\u201cHaha, Not exactly. But I trust we\u2019re going to have a good time!\u201d I told her trying to shake off my nervousness. \n\n\u201cMaple here has the best shit! She never disappoints!\u201d Bill blurted out enthusiastically...What an ass kisser. \n\nI looked over to the woman named Maple, \u201cOh? I\u2019m excited to see what you have! How much?\u201d I asked.\n\nShe smirked, \u201cI\u2019ll collect afterwards, no issue. Just enjoy yourself.\u201d\n\nNow I know I should have alarm bells going off in my head but I wouldn\u2019t be here if I made good decisions in my life...right? I lived everyday for my next high and this was it. She pulled out a glass bottle with what looked like a black liquid inside. Maple gave the bottle a light shake, something was swirling inside of it. Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me but it looked like eyeballs were inside of the bottle. \n\nShe then unpacked two small syringes and began to fill them up with the black liquid. I looked over and saw Bill\u2019s eyes open wide with excitement. When I looked over she was in front of us with both her hands out, each presenting a single black needle. Bill was shaking, he snatched up the syringe and gestured for me to grab the other. I reached for the other syringe and when my fingertips touched it I winced, it felt so cold. \n\nI picked up the needle and it burned cold in my hands, it was almost unbearable. I\u2019ve injected all sorts of things into me, but this...whatever this thing was black like oil. I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t just a little nervous about putting this in me, but Maple clasped my hand and smirked at me. There was something about her that made me feel okay with doing this...and that was really dangerous, as if I was under some kind of spell. \n\n\u201cSo what can I expect from this?\u201d I asked warily\n\nShe leaned in close, her face just a few inches away from mine. \u201cThe greatest fucking experience you\u2019ll ever have..\u201d she whispered. \n\nMy heart began to race with anticipation and my eyes were glued onto the needle as I pressed it into my vein. As I injected the black liquid into me it felt as though my veins were freezing as it ran slowly from my forearm...up to my shoulders\u2026.into my chest...whatever it was I could feel it chill my entire body. My neck tightened as it flowed upwards towards my head, it was like every nerve in my brain was turning into ice. I cried out in agony...what the fuck did I put inside of me. \n\nThat was when I felt myself slip away, I looked over towards Maple. She smiled at me, her teeth were razor sharp and her lips stretched wider and wider beyond physical capability. My vision began to fade into darkness as if a black veil was going over my eyes. I tilted my head backwards towards the couch but I touched nothing, I continued to fall backwards into nothingness for minutes\u2026.hours\u2026.days\u2026\n\nI was in absolute darkness, falling...no...sinking into a silent abyss. I couldn\u2019t feel my body anymore. Was I dead? It was as if my soul was being swallowed up by something. I couldn\u2019t see...where are my eyes? I wanted to scream, but I had no mouth...I had no lungs to breathe in. I was afraid...what was I afraid of? I\u2019m no longer me...I no longer exist\u2026.I am nothing. \n\nI woke up suddenly gasping for air, I flailed my arms and legs...oh god my limbs are back. I open my eyes to look around and I find myself back in the apartment. It was dark but I recognized the picture frames and the decor, I looked over to see that Bill was gone. Was it night? Where is Bill? Where is Maple? It was difficult, but I slowly got myself up onto my feet. I was shaking so bad, it was like I didn\u2019t know how to walk for a second. \n\nI check my pockets for my phone...nothing. I walked over to the nearest window, I thought it was simply night time but when I looked beyond the glass I saw just empty darkness. There were no signs of any light, just an absolute void outside. I ran towards the front door, I needed to get out of here. I left the living room into the hallway that led towards the front door, I ran and I ran...for so fucking long. Why haven\u2019t I reached the front door yet? \n\nI continued to run and run and run and run, but the door was nowhere in sight. My breath echoed in the endless dark hallway, the carpeted flooring couldn\u2019t muffle the banging of my footsteps as I continued to fucking run. I felt something run down my face, it was wet and so damn cold as it just poured from my forehead down to my chin. I used a hand to wipe it off but it smeared like oil. I ran and I ran when suddenly I started to feel my feet sink into the carpet, every step I took I sank deeper and deeper into the ground. \n\nI woke up suddenly gasping for air, I flailed my arms and legs...oh god my legs are still here. I open my eyes to look around and I find myself back in the apartment. It was dimly lit, I recognized the picture frames and the decor, I looked around to see that Maple was gone. I slowly got up, my legs were aching as if I was running a marathon. I was shaking so bad, it was so cold in here. \n\nI check my pockets for my phone...nothing. I was thankful for the lights although they were so dim it barely made a difference anyways, but I looked around for some kind of indicator of time. What time is it? How long was I out? That was the moment I came to the realization that there were no windows here. No windows...no doors...nothing. Just me in this room...alone. My heart began to race...faster and faster. I need to get out...how can I get out? I need to get out\u2026.how can I get out? \n\nI ran towards the wall and I began to slam my fists onto it. I need to get out...I need to get out. I turned to see the couch...it was closer to me now. The couch is getting closer...no...the room is getting smaller. The living room I was in was slowly shrinking into a box. I had to get out..I lifted my arm to pound onto the wall again, but I can\u2019t move it anymore. I\u2019m stuck...I\u2019m stuck...I\u2019m stuck...I can\u2019t move anymore. I feel the walls on my chest...its pressing against my back and it\u2019s shrinking...crushing me. \n\nI woke up suddenly gasping for air, I flailed my arms and legs...oh god my arms, I can move my arms. I open my eyes to see myself back at my apartment. I recognize my television and my decorations. I looked around and sure enough, it was just me at home. I pushed myself up onto my feet, my arms and hands were aching. I walked over to the thermostat...it was so fucking cold here. \n\nI stepped towards the hallway and stood in front of the thermostat. I switched the heat and I instantly heard the vents roar as the warmth slowly but surely began to kick in. My skin began to tingle as heat began to wrap around me...tighter and tighter and tighter. Someone was behind me and they were squeezing my body. I felt my feet lift from the ground as I kicked and screamed for them to let go. I felt my joints crack under the person\u2019s strength. \n\nI felt my body move, I was soaring through the air and I immediately crashed onto the couch. I turned to see a completely black figure standing in the hallway, it was so tall that it had to lower itself onto the floor just to get through the threshold into the living room. I tried to get up but I looked down to see my right light broken, near my ankle a bloodied broken bone was sticking out of my flesh. \n\nBefore I could let out a scream, the figure darted at me on all fours. It moved so quickly, almost like a snake and it pinned me onto the floor. I looked into it, it was completely black, as if I was staring into a shadow. It stuck its hands into my mouth and began to slowly pull my lower jaw down\u2026.down...down. I could hear something crack, an immense pain exploding from my mouth. It proceeded to stick its shadowy hand into my mouth, it was freezing cold. \n\nA wave of frost began to enter my body as the figure began to shrink, it sank deeper into me and the cold flowed into my body. I woke up suddenly gasping for air and I let out a scream with all of my might. I felt a hand grip onto my shoulder and I flinched and screamed again. I looked over to see Bill staring at me. He reassured me that everything was okay...everything was going to be okay. \n\nWe were back in the apartment, that damn apartment and that fucking sofa. I just got up and left. Bill called out to me but I ignored him and went straight out the door. I rushed down the stairs and stepped outside. Everything was normal...I looked in my pockets and pulled out my phone...a couple of hours had passed but it felt as though I was in that fucking nightmare for days. I just felt so cold afterwards, it took me a week to finally feel warm again. \n\nFuck. That. I got online and checked myself into a rehab program. I did the 12-step program and I went to every meeting without missing a beat. Slowly but surely I finally started to feel better, the events of that day were burned into my memory but I was able to ignore them. I thought I was able to ignore them until last night. I woke up suddenly gasping for air, I flailed my arms and legs..I rushed out of my bathroom and vomited right into the toilet. \n\nI started to feel so cold and my skin ached. I flipped on the bathroom light and looked into the mirror and fucking screamed. I saw my reflection...it was me...but my skin was torn. It was like patches of my skin had been peeled off. I looked at my hands and saw bits of my flesh underneath my nails. I felt so fucking cold. I was shaking as I looked back into the mirror to see my eyes...they were completely black...devoid of all white...just absolute darkness.\n\nMy hands began to move on their own and slowly removed the rest of my skin. The sound of my skin tearing off of me echoed in my ears. It was seconds...minutes...hours\u2026 When everything was removed...i thought I was going to see a red fleshy inside..but it was just darkness. I hear a knock on my door and I can hear Maple\u2019s sweet voice calling out to me. It\u2019s so cold here and I feel like if I go to her I will feel good...better. I feel myself losing control...I want to give in and go to her. I\u2019m so tired of running away...so before I hop out this window and fall...fall...fall..I wanted someone out there to know...I tried..I tried so hard to get better.","12":"[Part 1: Revelation](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qqckys\/growing_up_i_wondered_why_i_had_an_imaginary\/)\n\nCoarse sand stung my cheeks as the fierce wind swept over the dunes, lashing my skin.\n\nI paid no mind to the elements. The beach could have opened up and swallowed me whole, casting my disconsolate form into the earthen depths before burying me alive and still I wouldn't have noticed. My hands tugged at the messy tresses dancing in the salty breeze. Knuckles whitened, scalp throbbing as hair follicles came dangerously close to tearing free from my flesh.\n\nAnd still I felt nothing.\n\n\"Bell?\" Vern asked tentatively, horned brow furrowed with concern. \"I - I know it's a bombshell but its not like it's the end of the...\" He paused. \"Ah, fuck me.\" Rubbing a scaly neck, the guardian grimaced.\n\nI stared right through him, ignoring his demonic presence. Why did it all come to this? Why had I been selected for this accursed destiny? Didn't I have wishes of my own? Fragile dreams, tender ambitions of ethereal futures swam before my mind's eye, dashing to pieces against this rocky revelation. Blissful fantasies I couldn't possess, love I'd never attain.\n\nThe trembling rage had dissipated, leaving a staggering emptiness in its wake. I lost all willpower to pick myself up from the crumbling dock which mirrored my shattered spirit.\n\nVern gave up his attempts to bolster my morale. He plopped beside me as I silently watched murky waves crash violently against the shore, curling his leathery wings around my slumped figure as the freezing air shrieked by. Rejecting his small comfort, I shoved the bat-like appendages away and embraced those freezing gales.\n\n\"You knew,\" I muttered. \"All my life, while entertaining me with silly games and clever distractions, you knew where it was all headed.\"\n\nHe clasped clawed hands, bowing his head. \"Aye. It was never supposed to turn out this way...\"\n\n\"Bullshit.\" I snorted, hugging my knees as I stared at seagulls wailing over the horizon.\n\nVern picked up a rock and chucked it into the ocean. The stone skipped twice before a sudden surge consumed it, dragging the pebble down undulating depths. \"It's not like I had a choice, kid. Think you're the only schmuck dangling from puppet strings?\"\n\n\"I thought you were my friend,\" I remarked flatly, turning away from him. His lanky figure flinched. Inwardly, I bitterly cheered.\n\n*That's right, Vern. You've broke my trust and now I have no intentions of letting you forget it. So much for my partner in crime.* \n\nMy heart ached, recalling a lifetime spent running amuck and terrorizing the neighborhood. Hell, we plotted world domination a few times. Who could have imagined those whimsical plans had a serious undertone?\n\nThe lesser fiend rustled his claws, forked tail thumping against the sand. \"I know nothin' I can say will change your mind,\" Vern began.\n\n\"Damn straight,\" I snarled. \"So don't bother.\"\n\n\"But,\" He continued, \"One thing I can do is give ya some much needed answers. Well, bring you to a demon who can at least.\"\n\nI wrapped raven curls around a finger, glaring at the tangle of glossy fibers. \"Is that so? And why would I care? I don't exactly have any confidence in you or any of your pals.\"\n\n\"No pal of mine,\" Vern grunted unhappily. \"More like my direct supervisor.\"\n\nRolling my eyes, I barked a humorless laugh. \"Ha. Let me guess, you answer to the Prince of Lies?\"\n\n\"Not quite,\" He shook a pair of twisted prongs, biting his wrinkled lips. \"It's a succubus you know quite well. I think it's time we pay a visit to your Aunt Lilith.\"\n\nI buried my face in my knees and answered in a muffled growl. \"As if I'd go anywhere with you. Sounds like another one of your schemes.\"\n\nVern stood, shaking sand off his shadowy hide. \"Bell,\" He smiled wistfully. \"I know I've been a shithead but no matter what stunts went down I was always in your corner. Do you really think that little of me?\"\n\n\"Keep that flapping that silver tongue. You're just trying to talk your way out of trouble like always.\" The mention of Lilith did spark some minor interest. But what if this was his master plan? To lure me back to the underworld a final time? It was years since our last visit. He never did explain why we hadn't returned since I was a toddler.\n\nThe lesser fiend flew from the beach and hovered before me, flashing his signature cheeky grin. \"Can you give ol' Verny last chance? What have you got to lose?\"\n\nI narrowed my eyes, chewing on my hair in thought.\n\nAfter a long minute of juggling uncertainties, I relented with a listless sigh. \"Fine. Just make it quick. If things go sour you better believe I'll use everything at my disposal to obliterate your sulfurous ass.\"\n\nVern chuckled softly. \"That's my girl.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe scarlet darkness of a sunless sky stretched out over the collapsing acropolis where lamentations of tormented souls rose in unending chorus. Hulking forms trudged through the ruins, seizing the afflicted within their merciless grasp. This was the kingdom of shadowed misery.\n\nA domain belonging to those ruled by lewd desires, doomed to spent aeons skulking in shame as they paid for sins committed in secrecy, adulterous affairs furtively embraced within bedrooms and hotels, carnal acts spent under shrouded sheets as individuals basked in their perversions, immortal stains only witnessed by divine eyes.\n\nWe had arrived in the second ring of Hell, the realm of lust.\n\nI eyed the grim surroundings with indifference, noting the decrepit buildings and cracked statues had not changed since I was a child. When was it last that we traveled to these gloomy lands? I scarcely recalled the journey, skipping along the winding road as I held Vern's hand and clutching my stuffed giraffe with the other.\n\nVern slowly flew ahead as I tread over the uneven path, his fiery eyes illuminating the gloom. A wraith crawled over the stony trail, hands reaching for me as sewn lips emitted muffled pleas, his lower half nothing more than shredded flaps of flesh. Our gaze met for a split second, bloody tears streaking a filthy face. He might have been handsome, once.\n\nI stepped around the cursed mortal as a massive hand reached out from the eternal twilight and dragged the moaning victim back into the darkness.\n\n\"Charming place,\" I muttered, keeping close to Vern.\n\nHe shrugged, blue flames falling from his scorching brow. \"They say it grows on you in time. Personally, I prefer the swampy comforts of Gehenna.\"\n\nWe picked our way through the rubble, working toward the forbidding city lying within the valley. The flickering light spilled over a decapitated bronze effigy, green rust blooming over ancient metal feet scarred by the scratches of countless fingernails. A few steps further, the broken head appeared beside us. Its mouth gaped open in a soundless scream, features lost to time.\n\nThe stronghold gates loomed before us, unknown sigils carved into the basalt doors. I observed various scenes sculpted into the ebony stone, reliefs of body intertwined, euphoria and agony twisting faces, engaging in a massive orgy while demons flayed their petrified flesh.\n\nVern spoke in a harsh sibilant language, commanding entry to the unholy palace. The stone creatures shifted, eyes glowing as the gates cracked open with a booming vibration, shaking the wasteland and making me stumble. \n\nI clung to Vern for balance, his wings flapping rapidly to keep himself upright.\n\n\"You cool?\" He asked, glancing at the giant stone slabs parting before us. I swallowed, tucking stray locks behind my ear. \"Yeah. Let's just get this shit over with.\"\n\nTogether we ventured into Libidine - the lecherous citadel, where the empress of sensual thirst and animal desires awaited.\n\n\"It might be best if you close your eyes for this part,\" My guardian admitted, glancing at me sheepishly. \"You'll thank me later.\" Wordlessly, I clasped his clawed hand and shut my sight away, knowing what was about to come.\n\nHis callused palm rubbed against mine, bringing back old memories. We'd done this before when I was small enough for Vern to carry. I didn't understand what was happening back then, but now I was all too aware of the terrible things he shielded me from. Or so I thought.\n\nInside the walls, an awful odor greeted nostrils with a cloying perfume, churning my stomach. But those noises... the deafening noises were so much worse.\n\nThe rhythmic thuds of meat smacking wetly, low grunting, soft moans, desperate pleading, sudden shrieks, flesh tearing, breathless gasps, and cruel laughter all melding in a hideous cacophony, forcing bile to rise in my throat. Fluids splashed onto the ground beside us. I flinched away, feeling Vern grip me protectively.\n\n\"It's okay,\" He murmured. \"I've got you. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other.\"\n\nMy legs quivered while I blindly followed him through the humid abyss. Invisible fingers groped at me. I whimpered, clutching Vern as he whirled furiously, lashing out. The assailant hissed unpleasantly and shrank back.\n\n\"Sorry about that,\" The demon growled, wrapping wings around me. \"Horny bastards are everywhere.\"\n\nThe ground was slick with unknown liquids, making each step treacherous. Vern carefully guided me up a flight of slippery stairs, catching me when I stumbled and waiting until I was brave enough to move on. I shuddered as something slithered past us, smacking its lips.\n\nVern nudged me encouragingly. \"You're doing great, kid. Just a little more and we can rest easy.\"\n\nTaking a shaky breath, I summoned the strength to climb the final stair. Creatures cackled, hinges squealed, doors clicked open, expelling hot air rank with decay and musky orifices. We moved into a chamber as the sickening sounds faded behind us.\n\nThe guardian rested claws on my trembling shoulder, unfurling his wings from around me. \"It's alright now,\" Vern sighed heavily. \"You can open them.\"\n\nTentatively, I dared to peek at our surroundings.\n\nWe were standing within a lavish antechamber, coral pillars lining the gaping entrance to a narrow corridor. Flaming torches hung on the walls, casting a red glow over the room. \n\nA pair of muscular male guards stood on opposite sides of the entryway, wearing leather gags over their mouths, gilded breastplates and... nothing else. They clutched long poles with snares dangling from the ends. I eyed those sinister nooses, hoping they wouldn't see any use.\n\n\"Come on,\" Gesturing to the hallway, Vern flew over and beckoned for me to follow. \"She's expecting us.\"\n\nReluctantly, I passed through the slit shaped opening, hugging myself as I warily watched the incubus guards. Unblinking eyes tracked me, saliva drooling from their gagged mouths.\n\nVern led me down the passage, pulling open an iron door and slipping into the great hall. Sensual fresco decorated the tile floor, which stretched towards a rose colored throne. The decor was dripping with phallic and yonic shapes, making me feel even more uncomfortable after the harrowing ordeal on the outskirts of the palace.\n\nA succubus wearing shabby rags was busy polishing the throne with her forked tongue. We approached as she rubbed a cloth over the moisture with a scowl. \"Where's Lilith?\" Vern asked, neck craning as he glanced around.\n\n\"Taking her usual beauty bath,\" The demoness spat. \"I'm sick of being her bitch. You'd think my talents were better suited out there but I drew the short straw for the next thousand years.\"\n\nSmiling sympathetically, Vern thanked her and started to move on.\n\n\"Wait,\" The lowly succubus stood up. She glanced at my guardian and flashed him a racy grin, tail waving mischievously. \"Do you want to have a little fun first? I've been dying to get some action. She won't even let me play with the incubuses, says I'll spoil their appetite.\"\n\nShuffling his feet, he coughed politely. \"Sorry, I've got important business to attend to. Maybe next time.\"\n\n\"What about her? I'm not picky.\" Glancing me up and down, the maid bit her lip and blew me a kiss. \"How about it, girly?\"\n\nI shied behind Vern as her ugly scowl returned.\n\n\"Everybody's asexual around me apparently.\" She hissed, flicking her tail angrily. \n\nVern put his arm around my shoulders and pulled me away while the servant sourly continued cleaning the spotless throne. Curses faded into the distance as we slipped into another passage and left the great hall behind.\n\n\"Is everyone like that here?\" I asked fearfully. He gave me a wry half-smile. \"That and then some.\"\n\nThe familiar sound of running water echoed down the corridor, growing louder once we neared the beaded curtain at the end. Vern pulled the veil aside, allowing me to enter first. I wrinkled my nose, inhaling the metallic odor of rust. After I entered the bathing chamber, I discovered the pleasant melody of rushing liquid wasn't water at all.\n\nIt was blood.\n\nAn enormous vat of crimson fluid flowed before us. Two golden statues knelt on the opposite end, a naked man and woman embraced in an obscene display as static tongues intertwined. From their genitals, twin fountains of gore poured into the tub. \n\nFat black flies buzzed around the sticky cistern, feasting on the caked clumps scabbing the walls and floor, gleefully rubbing hairy legs together.\n\nI put a hand to my stinging nose, feeling lightheaded from the overpowering stench. Vern watched me with concern. Shaking my head, I signaled to him that I was alright, he needn't worry.\n\nBubbles emerged from below, popping on the oily surface. Blood clots floated away from the ripples, chunks drifting toward the edges of the pool. A shape undulated below, causing the contents to spill over the lip, splashing at my feet. Nimbly, I avoided those scarlet puddles.\n\n\"Why does she soak in this disgusting mess?\" I whispered to my guardian as humming insects whizzed past.\n\nHe shrugged, scratching his warped spurs. \"Blood of virgins, I believe. Mostly men. They get it from the ones who kill themselves from loneliness. She says it's a good exfoliate.\"\n\nHorns slid out from the dark red lake.\n\nWet hair clung to sanguine features as Lilith raised herself from the bath, exhaling a purr of contentment. Wiping the plasma from her eyes, she licked the dripping fingers with pleasure. The succubus queen bit her sharp nails and winked at me.\n\nI felt a tremor of fear at her smouldering gaze, peering into orbs of pure umbra that absorbed all light.\n\n\"My my,\" She sighed huskily. \"How I've missed you, Jezzy. Awfully rude to keep me waiting all these years. I was beginning to think you weren't coming back for Sally.\"\n\nI frowned, the name bringing back a long forgotten memory. A fuzzy comrade, that stuffed giraffe my father bought me as a birthday gift, the one I always snuggled with in bed. I couldn't remember where I put it last. Turns out I'd lost in the depths of Hell.\n\nLilith pulled the soaked toy from the gory water, hugging it to her chest. \"It was the only gift you ever gave me.\" Tenderly, she kissed the bloated animal on the head. \"Now you two can be reunited again.\"\n\nThe thought of touching that childhood artifact made me want to retch.\n\nI shook my head rapidly. \"No, no. It's okay, really. She's... she's yours.\" Forcing a smile, I resisted the sudden urge to grab Vern's arm. \"A gift's a gift, right?\"\n\nLaughing musically, Lilith waded towards us. \"Such a sweetheart. I see that hasn't changed one bit.\" \n\nShe tossed the soggy giraffe to Vern, who held it outstretched with a grimace. Tilting her head to the side, the empress squeezed the thick moisture from her hair and began wrapping the wet locks around elegant horns to dry.\n\n\"Oh how deliciously you've grown. Who knew that little girl would have such a voluptuous figure?\" Lilith eyed me with a lascivious gaze, forcing me to cross my arms unconsciously.\n\n\"Come to my bedroom,\" She smirked, \"I have a gift for you as well.\" Sliding out of the bath, the empress rose to her full height, towering over Vern and I. She sauntered through the beaded curtain, blood-streaked hips swaying erotically.\n\nI looked at Vern, eyes wide. \"She's... she's not, right? Tell me we didn't come here for THAT.\"\n\nHe swallowed, shaking his head. \"I wanna say no, but you can never be certain with that one. Lilith ain't the succubus queen for nothing. Don't worry, I won't let her try anything kinky. It's just a conversation... I hope.\"\n\nWe followed the crimson footprints to her chambers, where the hemic empress was busily brushing her lengthy mane before a curved mirror. \n\nLilith met my gaze in the reflection, lips curled with delight. \"Tell me,\" She breathed seductively. \"What took you so long to visit your dear aunt?\"\n\nI shrugged, unsure of what to say. Then my irritation took the reigns, remembering the reason for our arrival. \"Was busy I guess. Not like I really knew what was going on. You and Vern kinda left out the part about me being the Whore of Babylon. Thanks for that.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" The succubus put the gory hairbrush to a dainty chin. \"I'd almost forgotten.\"\n\nI narrowed my eyes. \"Cut the crap. You knew exactly what was going on. I never had a say in this. What if I don't want to be your harlot of doom or whatever?\"\n\nLilith chuckled, placing her brush upon the vanity table. \"You seem to be a little misguided, sweetie. Why wouldn't you rise to your destiny? Don't you know what it means?\"\n\nFolding my arms, I cocked an eyebrow. \"Apocalypse, end of the world, all that jazz? Things are going good for me right now, I'd like to keep it that way.\"\n\nShe turned around with a disappointed sigh, pendulous breasts swaying obscenely.\n\nI winced and looked away. \"Could you put something on? I'd appreciate a bra, at least.\"\n\nHuffing, Lilith placed sticky hands on her narrow waist and glared at Vern. \"I didn't know you raised her to be such a prude.\"\n\nVern coughed and said nothing, rubbing his neck. I glanced at him, wondering if I'd have turned out differently under the tutelage of some other demon. Maybe he wasn't such a bad friend after all.\n\n\"Well if it makes you feel better, I suppose some formal attire isn't out of the question.\" \n\nThe empress sniffed and lifted her arms in the air. Dried blood evaporated from her flawless skin. A circlet of finger bones appeared on her head, skeletal ribs wrapping around an ample bust as a mini-skirt encircled her broad hips in a skimpy gown of ivory femurs.\n\nTwirling before me, Lilith struck a pose and tossed her shimmering hair. \"Better?\"\n\n\"Much,\" I said dryly. \"Now can we settle this whole business? I'd like to be home in time for dinner if that's alright with you.\"\n\nVern chimed in, voicing his own intentions to keep our stay to a minimum. \"Yeah. We got a uh... a busy day of sinful activities planned tomorrow. Descratin' churches 'n shit. Souls ain't gonna damn themselves, you know.\"\n\nThe succubus queen pouted exquisitely. \"Oh come now, what's the rush? You've only just arrived, dear Jezzy.\"\n\n\"Don't call me that,\" I snapped. \"I always hated my name. Plus I'm not buying your cutesy doting aunt routine.\"\n\nHer haunting features twitched, warmth freezing into a chilling mask.\n\n \"I see,\" Lilith remarked. \"Seems the little girl has grown into her teeth.\" \n\nShe turned back to the mirror and stretched out a razor nail. It clicked on the glass surface, images rippling as the polished expanse morphed into a window.\n\n\"Observe carefully then,\" Lilith said indifferently. \"You wished for answers and now you shall receive.\"\n\nSmoke billowed around the edges of the portal, masking the images. Gradually, outlines emerged. I witnessed myself, seated upon a great and terrible beast. Seven heads bowed beneath my regal form, an amethyst cloak of orchid petals draped over my shoulders while scarlet silk straps cradled curves, forming a pentagram over my exposed chest as the rich fabric flowed downwards, more lingerie than dress.\n\nAs I watched in horror, my alter ego spoke a wordless command. The imposing hydra clambered to gargantuan feet, crushing ant sized people as it tread towards a burning city.\n\nSkyscrapers toppled, monuments collapsed, flames consuming the wreckage while my satanic doppelganger expressed amusement amid the carnage, laughing blithely at death and destruction. One of the creature's heads twisted backward, allowing the harlot to step on. She raised arms, bejeweled bracelets shining as the monster carried her down to the ruins below.\n\nThe Whore of Babylon stood atop mounds of corpses, rubbing her indecent body with pleasure as the injured and dying crawled beneath her heels.\n\n\"Isn't it glorious?\" Lilith sighed reverently. She reached out and stroked the mirror, fingers tenderly running over my corrupted figure.\n\nI didn't share her rosy view. My impression was one of incomprehensible dread, a knot twisting my guts at the apocalyptic vision. There was no way I would willingly become the source of calamity, right? Who would take joy in this grim future?\n\nTurning away from the haunting prophecy, I glanced at Vern. He was still clutching a dripping Sally, staring at the sodden giraffe with a haunted expression.\n\nWhen I returned to the looking glass, the Whore was naked.\n\nShe lay atop a mass of writhing bodies as the crippled and deformed survivors began engaging in a massive orgy. My abdomen spasmed. I threw up, coughing and gagging as I heaved, violently sick at the vile perversion.\n\nVern didn't react, mournfully examining the remnant of innocence.\n\n\"This is my favorite part,\" Lilith cooed, hugging herself with excitement.\n\nI didn't want to see. My mind refused that unthinkable outcome, the doom I couldn't escape from. But I had to know. I had to witness the tainted birth of my new persona, to understand the truth of my existence.\n\nA shadowy man crawled from the pile of flesh, pulling himself towards my disrobed form. The Whore accepted the stranger with open arms, wrapping her legs around his waist and kissing him deeply as the two shapes became one. A flaming crown burst to life upon his faceless head.\n\n\"The Anti-Christ,\" Moaning quietly, Lilith gasped at their intimacy. \"You will spread your corruption and bring forth a great and terrible lover. He shall command the armies of Abaddon and you will be his queen.\"\n\nMy twin opened her mouth in shameless ecstasy, locking eyes with me for a long moment. Then the vision faded back into our surroundings.\n\nShuddering uncontrollably, I sank to the cold stone floor, completely drained by my disturbing representation. Vern dropped the stuffed animal and knelt beside me.\n\n\"I tried,\" He muttered. \"I really did.\"\n\nCocking her crowned head, Lilith gave him a strange look. \"Tried what, exactly? You didn't disobey my explicit instructions now, did you?\"\n\nScrambling to his clawed feet, Vern rustled his wings uncomfortably. \"Wouldn't dream of it, my queen. I meant I tried to warn Bell but she wouldn't listen. Damn kid's a stubborn one.\"\n\n\"Is that why she's still a virgin? I could smell that disgusting purity on her the moment she stepped into this castle.\" The pleasantness was long gone from her voice, replaced by a malevolent disdain. She moved toward Vern, feet quietly padding like a predatory panther.\n\nHe slowly backed away as Lilith neared, the darkness in her furious gaze growing more voluminous. \"Still working on that angle,\" Vern smiled weakly. \"We still have time, right? The prophecy said something about an eighteenth birthday?\"\n\nThe empress lunged, snatching him by the neck. He struggled in her grasp, wings beating against her fist.\n\nI reached towards him, lips quivering. \"Please,\" I rasped. \"It wasn't his fault.\"\n\nHolding him at eye level, Lilith smirked wickedly. \"I've been watching your progress all this time. Thought you could waste years traipsing around the earth and settle for some venial sins? I'm disappointed in you, Vern. The Morningstar had such high hopes in your potential.\"\n\nCoughing, Vern choked out a reply. \"Even... Lucifer refused... orders. Thought he'd see... the irony.\"\n\n\"You have no right to say that name!\" Lilith hissed. Clutching a fluttering wing, she tore it free from his infernal body as he shrieked.\n\nI screamed along with him, tears spilling down my face as black ichor spurted onto the ground. \"Stop! Please, don't hurt him... I'll rise to the calling! I do whatever you want, just please let him go.\" Sobbing desperately, I crawled over to her feet and grabbed a slender ankle.\n\nLilith kicked me, a powerful blow sending my winded body against the wall. I crumpled to the ground, wheezing for breath as she ripped the other leathery appendage from Vern. He stopped howling, slumping in her vengeful clasp.\n\n\"Vern...\" I whimpered, unable to see his mutilated form through blurry sight. Wiping my sorrow away, I watched helplessly as the succubus queen slowly twisted off his horned head and held it before me.\n\n\"He was no true demon. Look upon him and witness what happens when you go against the will of Satan.\" Tightening her fingers, Lilith crushed Vern's skull with a sickening pop.\n\nI screamed, feeling the impact in my chest, pulverizing my heart as the best friend I'd ever known was obliterated before my eyes. Ichor splattered over my clothes, soaking into my skin. A part of me died in that room. It withered and vanished along with Vern, the mischievous trickster I absolutely hated and unquestionably loved.\n\n\"You bitch,\" I blubbered. If only I could call down lightning, summon the seven headed beast to rip Lilith to shreds. But no such power was at my disposal.\n\nTossing the decapitated carcass away, Lilith licked her oily hand and grimaced. \"Thought he'd taste better than that.\" Glancing down at my grieving figure, she sniffed in contempt. \"Look at you, languishing over a half-rate fiend. Don't fret now, darling. There's plenty of hellions in the sea.\"\n\nShe yanked me to unsteady feet and snapped her fingers. A doorway opened in the wall, crackling with demonic energy. Holding me before the opening, Lilith kissed me on the cheek.\n\n\"I did promise to get you back in time for dinner, didn't I? Not that you'll be hungry with all that sniveling. I'll be sending you a suitable replacement so you won't be too lonely. I do owe you a present, after all.\"\n\nShoving me through the portal, the succubus cackled as reality twisted and spun.\n\nWhen I sat up, I was back in my messy bedroom. I curled into a ball, tears streaking my face, softly keening over Vern's grisly execution. Now I had no one.\n\nI was alone in the world, left with nothing but my lamentations.","13":"In the year 2195 the world is burnt to a sunder by a massive solar flare from the Sun (Sol), it is made inhabitable and our blue marble turned grey. \n\nWe had enough time before that happened. For the first time in human history, every nation banded together (even though some need more incentive than to survive) and build our ships. We called them the Musk Arks (named after one of the first corporate space engineers to get us to Mars). Each Musk Ark contained 32 Fusion Reactors that would power the ship indefinitely. They also contained 1 billion human souls (in cryo stasis), terraforming equipment, food to last the population for 10 years, and animals (also in cryo stasis). They measure over 1000 km long and over 200 km wide made of a material that seems to be a cross between titanium steel and diamond. There are 10 of them named after every planet in the Solar System we came from (I will explain Pluto and Charon in a bit). Each ship connects to the others via Trans Space Network. Scientists  from the 2100s found that cryo stasis didn't put people to sleep as our prior science fiction belief told us. The mind is totally awake, much to chagrin of the first cryo nauts, so the engineers and scientists came up with the greatest social media game of all time Mind Werks. Mind Werks runs off the delta and gamma waves of a sleeping person and puts them into an Ultimate Virtually Real World. This world was built around the early 2000s. After setting up a new protocol for cryo stasis (basically put the person into deep sleep and then freeze) and setting up the Mind Werks to the read the thoughts. We were ready for our 40 year Journey to EQ Pegasi.\n\nThe Earth was scorched 4 years after we left.\n\nSounds like the beginnings of a great sci fi novel, right? Only problem is, its not science fiction. 3 years ago I was happily working on my databases when I started finding anomalies in the data I was looking at for a certain 4 letter Government Agency. Specifically Some of the stars were getting further away and some of them were getting closer. Not only that, historically they were much further off than they are now. This prompt me to send some questions to other Software Engineers and they told me about the Standard Deviation factor (i.e., not to worry about it use this variable and you numbers come back correctly). \n\nRealizing what this could mean, basically that this meant we were moving towards something, which made no sense. I mean we are on earth, I am sitting at my desk typing on a keyboard to a reddit forum. I started searching for answers. So I reached out to some others in the industry, to some web forums that are about conspiracy theories, as well as \\*dun, dun \\* a couple of flat earth boards. \n\nIt took 3 months before anyone, with any real information, got back to me with a rational explanation. A group calling themselves TrueEarth reached out to me. Then like Neo in the Matrix I started down the rabbit hole with them. \n\nWhat started out as data anomalies turned out to be something bigger. Our history, as far as MindWerks History that is, is slowly being rewritten by both the people of the world in it (Playing?) and shadow organizations that want the historical writing to be different. Confused? Ok, let me try to explain. The whole scenario was supposed to be fixed from 2000 to 2045 (a time when greatest tech advantages took place), this history was supposed to be lived by the people of Earth until we reach our destination. Nothing, was suppose to change this fixed history (of course others wanted a more fluid dynamic history). People were suppose to end in 2045 with the knowledge they lived through the last 45 years in the 2000s and then go through training and skill courses to see where they would end up in the colonization system on our new world. (They wanted to skip the 150 year war that nearly destroyed the human race, the colonization of almost every semi habitable planet in our solar system, and the multiple genocides of intelligent species that we had to do to colonize them) Putting us in our Age of Exploration Era.\n\nThere are 4 groups of people who know the truth and each have their own agendas on how things should play out before we reach our new home world. There are 129 \"Events\" that are suppose to play out with specific endings before we all wake up. The Events create a history that ignores the true history of what humans have done. \n\nThe TrueEarth is a group that wants to give the individuals the right to dynamically create the historical experience before we arrive. They do this by countering other groups and making it so that individuals have choices in the Events in history can be changed.\n\nMicroCorp is the major corporation that created the Arks and MindWerks and they want us to follow the rules of the game.\n\nAncryoists are a group that don't care about the rules of the came, they just want us to wake up now. (Though I am not sure based on the ships design what would happen to us or if we could, after reading some of the specs of the MindWerks program.)\n\nFinally, the last group really has no name but there agenda is pretty clear. They want those who know about the real world eliminated.\n\nFunny thing about death I found out, here rather recently too, there is a database that contains all our information out there (I am not sure if it is on servers per se or if is just in the Trans Space Network). Each of us signed a contract and in this contract (from what I can tell it was over 200 pages of questions and answers with a signature page) there was a page that indicated if we believed in life after death. (These contracts plus experiences in Mindwerks create records in the database) If this lovely little field is checked in your row of the database, you reincarnate. From what I can tell no new humans have been born in the last 20 years (also from what I can tell we have been on this journey for about 19 years) .Those who have the check box checked seem to \"die\" in Mindwerks, have their memory reset, and are put with a new family as a child. (Still trying to figure out those who don't have the box checked). \n\nSo when I say eliminated from the system, I mean cryo stasis chamber ejected from the ship and records deleted. I have found 4 people in the TrueEarth group that this has been done too. (People remember them but not what happened to them. Plus whoever wrote the code for the ejection and deletion process wasn't very good because I found rows of records that still pertain to them) As far as the ejection code goes, I can view it but can't modify it. It has Administrator privileges on it and we have only figured out how to get the Power User privileges of the system.\n\nSo why I am writing on Reddit, in a Virtual World, where I may or may not be believed? Easy, it is 1 of 4 places that the records stay after an ejection and people need to know. The world you see around you is just a high resolution video game with preset events taking place and unfortunately I think the Ancryoists got their hands on some code that might actually wake everyone up. \n\nFrom what I can tell on the schematics we are all in cryo stasis chambers stacked on each other, if we all wake up at the same time, there is no real place for us to go. The ship is designed to be a transport and not a living facility (outside of about a 100 man crew that jumps in and out of cryo sleep every 5 years, no one is awake) for a billion people and we are no where near a livable planet right now.\n\nSo if you wake up to a frosted over clear screen with a blue and red button on it, trust me and press the blue button and go back to sleep. \n\nI will try to fill you in more as I can but right now there are some people in a black van outside that I need to deal with.","14":"Now let's get this out of the way. I'm a serviceman in the Finnish military. I'm stationed at a little radar station in the middle of nowhere northern Lappland. for those who have no idea where that is, it's the very northern bit of the country and most of it is in the arctic.\n\nThe station is formed of three buildings + the radar tower. Building one is a barracks of sorts, its got four beds, a small kitchen and a bathroom. Building two is the radar building, it's where most of the equipment is and also where i work. In the upstairs there's a small office. Building three is a old parts shed between the barracks and radar building. Now you should have a fairly good grasp of our little \"compound\". The place has running water and electricity. Back when this place was built it was cheaper to run a couple dozen kilometers of wire than to give us a generator powerful enough to run the radar\n\nThe location is quite remote. Command says it's \"Tactically advantageous\". Yeah i guess it's harder to find a little dot in the middle of nowhere but it sure isn't fun being in said middle of nowhere.\n\nI should probably talk about the miserable morons i get to share this slice of heaven with. There's Ahti, he's our \"base commander\", he's basically the only one with any form of authority here. He's what equates to a sergeant in the US military. The rest of us are junior sergeants. There's Juho, he's the other radar tech. He has the day shift, usually. And finally there's yours truly, Timo the radar tech\n\nLife up here is usually uneventful, minus that one time a reindeer somehow managed to get on the roof of the barracks. Poor thing fell down and died. And by died i mean it hurt itself pretty badly and Juho put it out of its misery.\n\nMe and Juho share a little notebook where we scribble down all the weird-shit-I-saw-and-i'd-tell-you-if-i-wasn't-asleep's. ill start writing down some when i have time.\n\nNow that we have the groundwork out of the way let's get to the actual \"entries\"\n\n\\- START OF ENTRY 1 -\n\nOne cold January night the radar picked up two readings north-west of our location. In the very northern bit of Sweden and near the tri-point with Norway, Sweden and Finland.\n\nNow normally this wouldn't have been out of the ordinary but the aircraft appeared all of a sudden at 40.000 feet. The other abnormal thing is that both were going at about mach 5, one mach being the speed of sound. Straight towards the border.\n\nNow it isn't that unusual for the Swedish air force to make a visit to Rovaniemi or something. Now the Griepen is a quite fine fighter but holy hell nothing that i know of can do cruise at mach 5. The SR-71 did something like 3.4.\n\nAfter i had scooped all the shit from my pants i quickly dialed the military base over in Sodankyl\u00e4 and told them to look on the radar. Apparently my voice was panicked enough for whoever answered the phone to sprint into their radar building looking for foreign super-planes\n\nAbout 5 minutes later i heard someone walk over to the landline headset that had apparently been left on the table as the person sprinted out of the door. Apparently their considerably newer and fancier radar wasn't picking anything up.\n\nI quickly blamed the aging radar equipment playing tricks on us again, To avoid getting an earfull from whoever was on the other end\n\nThe signatures didn't leave my screen until they had left my radar's range. They were the size of a fairly normal sized military aircraft. No other reports were filed about mysterious super-planes probably breaking a few international treaties and violating some country's airspace.\n\n\\- END OF ENTRY 1 -\n\nI saw a heard of reindeer last night. They were oddly interested in that old truck that hasn't started for a few decades. I gave them some of the trail mix i was eating. They seemed happy about it.\n\nThe rest of the night was uneventful as ever. Just a few regional flights.\n\n\\- START OF ENTRY 2 -\n\n( Juho wrote this one )\n\nSo uh, i don't know if I'm loosing it or my messed up sleep schedule is starting to effect my hearing but I swear on my life i heard music coming from the woods last night. So unless a jazz club set up on government property in the middle of nowhere its my ears being bitches.\n\nLook i know I'm not supposed to use the binoculars for this but i just had to know\n\nI think I saw a small cabin a couple hundred meters from the station.\n\n\\- END OF ENTRY 2 -\n\nMe and Ahti went check out this cabin. We found nothing.\n\nI mean it's not the first time people have heard weird shit in the middle of nowhere but a whole ass cabin with jazz emanating? That's even a new one for Ahti.\n\nAt least we all like jazz.\n\n\\- START OF ENTRY 3 -\n\nI swear I saw a blinking green light last night. It wasn't morse or anything it was a steady blinking green light. I tried to use the night vision binoculars to see what asshole was fucking with me, I didn't really see anything but trees and a blinking green light that almost looked like it was coming from impossibly far away.\n\nShould we call the air force and tell them to use one of their fancy-pants cameras to look for this asshole? Need to talk to Ahti about that.\n\nAlso, did we get a shipment yesterday? I don't remember us having 20 cans of tomato soup under the stairs.\n\n\\- END OF ENTRY 3 -\n\nNo, none of us remember there being 20 cans of soup under the stairs. Nobody has visited the station in about a week. The supply truck comes in a few days.\n\nI also managed to lose my left hand glove. I swear I turned the station inside out looking for that thing. Need to ask the guys over at supply to bring in a new set.\n\nThe soup is pretty good. A solid 6\/10. Ahti hates it.\n\n\\---\n\nTo be continued. maybe.","15":"I've been dating my girlfriend Larissa for about 6 months now and everything has been going great. The only problem is that some of her friends don't like me. Larissa has plenty of friends I like and who really like me, but Abby, Paula, and Christina are the only outliers. What I hate more than anything else is how they all act like they like me, but anyone paying attention can tell they really don\u2019t.\n\nOne night, we were all hanging out together at a party and Abby, the lead friend who doesn't like me, mentioned camping as a subject and people started talking about it. \n\n\"What about you Joel?\" She turned to me. \"You strike me as the kind who likes to camp.\"\n\n\"Nope. I have no desire to camp whatsoever. The last time I went camping was 6 years ago, and since I didn't enjoy it one bit, I haven't been back since.\" \n\n\"Really?\" She tilted her head at me. \"I could've sworn you told me you went camping recently once. Last year, on the west coast, in the first week of August.\" \n\n\"No, I was in New York on business that week.\u201d \n\nAbby's face fell at this.\n\n\"What's the matter Abby? You look a little befuddled.\" I could hear the smirk in my voice. \n\n\"I just could've sworn you went camping then.\" She said in an almost meek voice. I could tell something was up, and I wanted to know what it was. \n\n\"Really? Why is that? I certainly never said anything about camping. You must have confused me with someone else.\" \n\n\"I guess so.\" She looked down at her drink like she wanted to sink through the floor. Paula and Christina were glaring at her like she had just done something beyond stupid. Which she probably did. I could feel the grin on my face stretch even wider as I saw Larissa watch it happen and silently took it all in. It was time to finally say what I was thinking.  \n\n\"Look Abby, I don't know what the hell your problem is with me or what's going on, but I'm sick of it and it stops now. If you're gonna talk about me, say it to my face and not behind my back to them.\" I pointed to Paula and Christina. \"So spit it out.\" \n\nShe sat there silently for a moment while I stared at her. But just as she opened her mouth to speak, Paula spoke up instead. \n\n\"Abby's been telling us for months that she heard your voice when she went for a weekend trip in Nora's cabin in the woods. One night, there was a group of intruders outside and when she heard a few people speak, she swore up and down that one of them sounded just like you.\"\n\n\"Well I wasn't even remotely near there because I was clear across the country for work.\" \n\n\"I swear, I thought it was you,\" Abby muttered feebly.\n\n\"Is that why you kept constantly making subtle jabs about why I shouldn\u2019t date Joel?\" Larissa snarled, her voice full of barely contained fury. \n\nAll she could do was nod.\n\n\"We're sorry Joel.\" Christina said quickly. \n\n\"Very sorry,\" Paula agreed.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" Abby looked at me. \"I hope we can be friends.\" \n\nI laughed. It sounded harsh even to my ears and it made Abby and the others flinch, a sight I got plenty of satisfaction from. \"Go to hell. And stay there. With friends like you, I wouldn\u2019t need enemies. I can understand you thinking I'm the wrong person and there being a mix up, but you never flat out asked or said anything to me. All you did was talk about me behind my back for months. So yeah, I\u2019m not exactly jumping up and down to be friends.\" \n\n\"Please, we're really sorry. Don't you believe me?\" Abby asked, her face a mask of pure panic. Christina and Paula were silently watching me with a similar expression.\n\n\"Do I look stupid to you? I wouldn't believe you if you told me the sky was blue. You're sorry alright, but not sorry you did it, you're sorry you got caught being wrong and now you look beyond stupid. So don't give me that let's be friends BS. I'm not your friend, and I don\u2019t ever want to be your friend. Let's go Larissa\" \n\nShe nodded and didn't so much as look at her friends as we left. \n\n\"I can't believe that. I\u2019m so sorry Joel.\" She said when we got in the car and were on the road. \n\n\"Well now you know. I just don't know what to make of her claiming she heard someone who sounded identical to me.\"\n\n\"She's an idiot and completely full of it. You know the saying about everyone having a twin somewhere. But even if she did hear someone that sounded just like you, what can we do about it now?\"\n\n\"Right.\" \n\nWe spent a lot of time together after that. Larissa severed all contact with her so-called friends, and it was a very happy time for us. For the first few weeks after the incident at the party Paula, Christina, and Abby repeatedly tried to contact Larissa for days on end, but she cheerfully ignored them every time. Once or twice they even tried to contact me through various means, but I was more than happy to do the same as Larissa. But then one morning it all abruptly stopped and neither of us paid much attention to it. \n\nOne weekend, we went to her cousin Beatrice's lake house for an overnight visit. It was a crisp fall night, pleasantly cool and windless. The smell of burning leaves was in the air as we had hamburgers on the grill before making s'mores with Beatrice and her husband Luke. Once that was over, we chatted about nothing in particular as night slowly set in and we sat on the deck overlooking the water and watched the stunning view of the lake, the tall pines that surrounded it, and the crescent moon that shimmered off the lake's surface. \n\nFrom my right side, I heard Larissa's phone ring and didn't give it much thought as she answered. \n\n\"Hey Danielle, what's up?\" she asked her best friend on the other end of the line. Larissa was silent for a moment as Danielle spoke. \n\n\"You're kidding me?\" she stood up as she asked the question. I could see from the look on her face that something was wrong. Luke and Beatrice also noticed something was amiss, but we were all silent as Larissa listened intently to whatever was being said.\n\n\"Ok.\" She finally said after what felt like an eternity. \"Thanks for letting me know. Keep me posted.\" With that, she ended the call and tossed her phone on her chair. \"Abby, Christina, and Paula are missing.\" She said to me before turning to look at Beatrice and Luke. \"They went camping with some friends and no one has seen them since. They were only recently reported missing, and the authorities have no idea what happened. The only thing they found was their camp site. Everything was intact, and there was no sign of anything amiss, aside from a single long scratch on the car.\"\n\n\"I'm so sorry Larissa.\" I said before I reached out and gave her a hug while Beatrice led her husband inside without a word. The night was calm, almost uncannily quiet. The two of us stood there on the deck for what seemed like an eternity before we joined our hosts indoors. \n\nThe lake house was beautiful. A two-story cabin with a solid wooden exterior, it had every modern luxury, a great stone fireplace, and a stunning glass enclosed porch. The fireplace was in the same room as the entertainment system, which we were about to put to use when I heard it. \n\nA gentle knock on the front door. So quiet you could barely hear it. Like whoever was on the other end was afraid of making too much noise. \n\nI glanced up and saw Luke and Beatrice looking at each other to make sure they had really heard someone knocking. \n\nThen, almost as if whoever was knocking could hear their thoughts, a second knock came. Louder than the first, it was still relatively gentle. \n\n\"Hey is anyone there?\" I heard a faint male voice asking. \n\nI don't know why, but for some reason the voice gave me chills. There wasn't any other house around for miles, so it wasn't easy for anyone to just stumble across the property. I could see our hosts wrestling with the same idea, as they were silently looking at each other, clearly unsure about what to do and wary about whatever was going on.\n\nBut before they could make another move a third knock came, much louder and more insistent than before. \n\n\"If anyone's there, we need help.\" A different male voice spoke. This voice sounded far more nervous than the first one. \n\n\"Don't worry guys, everything is fine.\" \n\nHearing Abby's voice made my stomach clench. I looked at Larissa and she looked like she was about to faint. Our two hosts saw our expressions and knew something wasn't right. \n\n\"I don't like this guys, something is wrong.\" \n\nThe sound of Paula's voice made Larissa put a hand to her mouth out of fear. As quietly as I could, I moved over to her and put an arm around her while trying to ignore my own feelings of crushing fear. Across from me, Luke and Beatrice hadn\u2019t moved an inch from their seats on the sofa. \n\nThe four of us sat there waiting for a moment, listening closely for any more sounds or voices. After what felt like an eternity, we heard someone walking away. \n\nOnce we waited a few minutes to make sure whatever or whoever was at the door was gone, Larissa explained what happened and Beatrice immediately called the police. When they got here, we explained what we'd heard and what we knew about her missing friends. The authorities took down everything she said, thanked her, and said they'd do what they could, but couldn't promise anything. We said we understood than thanked them for whatever they could do. \n\nThey never did find what happened to Abby and the others, and every time Larissa and I get invited to go camping with friends, we respectfully decline.","16":"In April 2020 my stepdad passed away from covid. Let\u2019s call him Joe. My mother was left home alone so I decided to move home and keep her company. I am 27, my mother is 57 and Joe was 52 when he passed. The only room available was Joes old storage room. So I did some spring cleaning, donating his clothes and keeping his personal belongings in boxes (photos, model cars, souvenirs etc). Among these were 3 very strange objects that gave me uneasy feelings. I wish I had taken photos of them\u2026\n\nThose 3 figures were big enough to go in their own box. These were to be put into the attic, which has one entrance..In the closet of that very same room. To get to it you need a ladder. I haul the boxes into the attic. It was mostly empty, with a few boxes in one corner and mostly just insulation. I put the boxes right above the room I would soon occupy. \n\n3 days later the first occurrence took place. I heard what seemed to be the sliding of the boxes I had put upstairs..almost as if someone was looking through them. I ignored it thinking it was wind or even squirrels. The next night I heard it again. This time I decided to check it out. I walk up the ladder, slide the door aside and scan the attic with my flashlight. I noticed one box was opened. It was the box with the 3 figures. I raced my mind to remember if I had closed that box. I clearly remember taping them all shut. As I stood there on the ladder with my head in the attic I noticed the sound of someone or something breathing. My heart fell into my stomach..as scared as I was, I quickly looked around the attic but it was empty. I quickly slide the entrance shut and come down the ladder and sit at my desk. I\u2019m in total shock and disbelief at this point. I thought I was having a nightmare. But I wasn\u2019t. I stood up til 5:30am that day. One hour later I woke up for work. Over coffee I explained to my mother what happened. She was silent for a minute. She smiled and said it was just a nightmare. I asked her about those figures joe had. She said she had no idea what I was talking about and maybe he gotten them at one of the hundred garage sales he went to. I brushed it off and went about my day. \n\n3 days later I am woken up to a clatter. This time it\u2019s clear. Footsteps\u2026right above me..heading towards the attic entrance. I then hear the sound of fingernails tapping on the attic door. I laid frozen in bed in complete fear. Then I heard the attic door slowly sliding open. The next thing has burned a haunting memory in my brain. The head of a long haired, pale face man or thing was hanging out of the attic opening. It had the most grim smile on its face. It whispered \u201cmay I come in??\u201d I stared at it in it\u2019s dead black eyes for about 15 seconds. Snapping out of it I bolted for my desk retrieving my .357 from the drawer. I quickly aim to the attic entrance but it was gone. \n\nI cannot sleep in that room anymore..and I don\u2019t think bullets would have been any help. The next morning I go to get the box..but it was empty. No sign of those figures in the attic and no signs of someone breaking in. I still hear those footsteps at night\u2026\n\nMammon, leviathan, and asmodeous were the three figures. According to my aunt whom knew of their existence in the house. \n\n\n\nBelow is a picture of the attic entrance. I hate going in that room\n\n\n[the attic entrance ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/RuTang94\/comments\/qs2r1f\/the_attic_entrance\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)","17":"There is a new virus on the web. You might as well call it the last virus. Nobody knows who is behind it. Nobody knows how it first spread.

I checked the number and found it blocked. My wife was out at work. I just returned from work. After a twelve hour shift of shit and misery in front of a boiling hot stove, the only thing that felt good to me was a cold glass of whiskey, then another. And another. And so forth. My senses were dulled and my paranoia stood at full tilt. That\u2019s probably the only thing that kept me on the line.\n\n\u201cWho the fuck is this?\u201d\n\nThe caller had a robotic tone to his voice. Almost like the old voicemail messages you used to hear back in the day. I thought it might be automated. I thought it could be a robocall. But the warning itself grabbed my attention. \n\n\u201c*You have one minute and fifty seconds to get out of the house.*\u201d\n\nWhat if there was an emergency? What if something happened? My wife would be driving home soon. What if she crashed?\n\n\u201c*You have one minute and forty seconds to get out of the house.*\u201d \n\nThe caller didn\u2019t answer my question. He didn\u2019t even seem to hear it. A clap of thunder echoed in the distance. Halloween decorations slapped up against the door. I looked out the bay window and noticed an eerie shade of purple painted into clouds in the distance. Almost like a tornado brewing, but we rarely saw tornadoes in Jersey, certainly not in November. The thunder in particular made me worry. Every few seconds came a new burst. I got up out of my chair and continued the conversation. I wasn\u2019t ready to listen to the caller. I just wanted to keep my options open. \n\n\u201cWho is this?\u201d I demanded. \u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d\n\nThe line beeped. Then it clicked. Then he laughed. \n\n\u201c*You have one minute to get out of the house.*\u201d\n\nA dull sort of panic took hold. I found my loafers in the kitchen by the dog bowl. I grabbed our puppy, Abigail. A branch from somewhere above fell and landed on our roof. The quake echoed through our cavernous living room. Abby cried and turned over into my arms. I realized then that we needed to move. \n\n\u201c*You have thirty seconds to get out of the house.*\u201d\n\nWe went for the door. The handle jammed from the rust. One of ten things to fix on my \u2018honey do\u2019 list. I rammed it with my shoulder, cracking the frame, not caring as the remains fell to the porch beneath me, grateful for the cool blast of rain and wind that smacked against my bare cheek.\n\n\u201c*You have twenty seconds to get out of the house.*\u201d\n\nThe backyard looked torn apart from the storm. Thick streams of water raced down the sidewalks. Heavy gusts ripped the remaining trees and leaves. I could barely see a thing in the shades of mist and spit and shit clinging to my glasses. I felt like Newman trying to steal the dinosaur DNA in Jurassic Park. \n\n\u201c*You have ten seconds to get out of the house.*\u201d\n\nMy feet hit the wet grass. I couldn\u2019t see it but I could feel it. My clothes were soaked in moments. Abigail whined piteously behind me. She was shivering. I tugged on the leash and thankfully she followed. \n\n\u201c*You have five seconds to get out of the house.*\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t have time to grab anything. I didn\u2019t have my wallet. I didn\u2019t have my keys. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t know what to say. The entire adrenaline rush left me gobsmacked, and the whole time, this nagging feeling that this could all be some sort of sick prank clung to the back of my mind like a ray of hope.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want? What is happening? Who is this?\u201d\n\nI heard an explosion but didn\u2019t see one. The next thing I remember, I was lying on my stomach in the backyard, with Abigail licking the side of my face, and a plume of smoke arcing behind her. The phone was still in my hand. \n\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I screamed. \u201cWhat the fuck did you do?\u201d\n\nMy home was on fire.\n\n\u201c*Upload complete.*\u201d\n\nAs ambulances and fire trucks raced to the scene from somewhere in the distance, I could hear somebody breathing in the background, listening to me struggle.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d I asked in a daze. \u201cHow? How did you know?\u201d\n\nThe line beeped. Then it clicked. Then he laughed. \n\n\u201c*We\u2019ll be in touch.*\u201d","18":"Case File #01281 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The following has been transcribed from a video found on a discarded Go Pro camera discovered by a search and rescue team. The camera lens was broken and no other information has been discovered about this incident.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The video opens with the owner of the camera attaching it to his chest. Once attached the camera faces forward, looking at the inside of a beautiful cave entrance.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The videographer narrates his journey throughout the video.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: Hey guys, welcome back to another exploration video! I'm here at the beautiful (REDACTED*)* caves herein (REDACTED) and I'm ready to dive into this cave! Let's get spelunking! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The videographer begins to walk into the cave. He travels through the cave sharing some background on the area and some facts about the area. This continues for approx. 27 minutes before he stops for a break. He looks down into a tight cavern that leads deep into the depths of the cave.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: Man this is such a beautiful cave, I'm not sure I feel like squeezing through this tight area here to go down but I'll head through this way so I can-- \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The videographer stops mid-sentence.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: Wait, can you guys hear that? I'm not sure if the audio is picking it up but it sounds like a voice is coming from down there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*He looks down into the cavern, a very quiet female can be heard. She is asking for help.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: She's asking for help, holy shit this isn't good. I'm too far in to get any service, maybe I should run out and call someone. But I don't even know how long she's been down there, she sounds weak. I should at least go check on her to give her some supplies. I'm going to leave this rolling just in case I need it for the police or something. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The videographer quickly packs away what supplies he took out of his pack and begins to climb down into the tight cavern previously seen on video. As he descends a faint female voice can be heard saying hello and asking for help.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: I can hear her super clearly now, she's gotta be right below me, but I can't even look down this area is so tight! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The camera shifts slightly as it scrapes against the walls of the cavern. The videographer continues to climb down for a few more minutes before reaching a large opening and ground. The female voice can be heard coming from just behind the videographer.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: Hello? Where are you? I'm here to help. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The camera pans around but no one is seen. The videographer is in a rather large cavern, there is a small river running through it and the entire cavern gives off a very damp feeling. The voice is heard coming from across the small river.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: Alright, it sounds like she's just over there. Let's get across this river and help her. The smell in here is unreal, this water stinks. I'm gonna need a serious shower when I'm done here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The videographer carefully crosses the river as the voice grows louder. The camera pans to see a small opening in the wall where the voice is coming from. The videographer makes his way towards it.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: Where are you? Yell out! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*A female voice can be heard coming from the small opening.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFemale Voice: Hello? Please, help me! I'm so thirsty and I think my leg is broken. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The camera pans to look directly at the small dark opening as the Videographer makes his way towards it.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: I'll help you, I have lots of water don't worry. We'll get you out of here! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The Videographer makes his way into the dark opening moving several large cobwebs as he passes through. An audible sound of disgust can be heard coming from him as he does this. The video feed is very dark and hard to see.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFemale Voice: Please, I\u2019m just ahead, keep going. Can you see me? I know it's dark but I think I can make out your silhouette, just a little further! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The Videographer continues to move through the small dark cave as he moves past multiple spider webs.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: I can't see a thing, my flashlight is in my pack it's too tight for me to grab it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFemale Voice: I can see you, oh my God I can see you! I'll get it for you once you're over here. Thank you, thank you! Just a little further, I'm so thirsty. Please hurry! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The Female voice begins to cry. The sound of her crying causes the Videographer to quicken his pace.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: Don't worry, we'll get you out of here. I think I see you! Wave your hands or something. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Although the feed is dark movement can be seen just up ahead. The videographer notices and begins to move even quicker.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFemale Voice: Oh my God, I'm saved. You're my hero! Just a little further... I'm so thirsty! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: Okay I'm almost to you, there are so many cobwebs around here it's making it hard. What are you even doing here anyway? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Several cobwebs can be seen rubbing against the camera as the Videographer makes his way through them.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFemale Voice: I'm guessing the same as you, I wanted to explore but tumbled into this cave when I slipped. My boots were wet from the river, so stupid of me. I thought I was going to die in here, but now you're here! Thank you, Thank you. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: You can thank me once we're outta here. I can see you--\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Suddenly the Videographer lets out a gasp as he loses his footing and lets out a yell as he begins to fall. The camera feed is still dark but the sound of wind rushing and the yells of the videographer indicate his falling. The only thing visible on the camera feed for approx. 37 seconds are large amounts of spider webs. The camera becomes covered in webbing. It's also assumed that he is also covered in webbing.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Light suddenly fills the camera feed and it quickly focuses as it smashes into the ground. The videographer begins to moan and yell for help, he manages to shift onto his back and clears the webbing from the camera. As he does this it is determined that the camera lens is broken but still able to record. The camera pans around revealing a massive cavern with an opening in the top that he fell out from. There is dim lighting in the cave making his surroundings visible.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: Shit, I can\u2019t move my legs. Shit. Shit. HELLO?? Can you hear me?? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*He frantically tries to move and yells for help but there is no response. As he painstakingly tries to move he turns around to see a large cave covered in an unnaturally amount of webbing.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: What the fuck, what the fuck is that? Shit. Shit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*He begins to breathe heavily as he tries to crawl away. As he does this a familiar voice is heard.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Unknown Woman*: Oh no, what happened? Are you okay? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The camera pans to see a fully naked woman standing in front of him.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: Why are you- how did you- what the fuck is going on?! Help me! Please! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*She begins to slowly walk towards him.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnknown Woman: I figured you deserved some kind of a reward for coming to the rescue of a voluptuous damsel in distress. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*She runs her hands over her body seductively, the Videographer quickly turns away and keeps trying to crawl away.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: What the hell are you talking about? You were in the cave, you said you needed help!! Now you're down here and naked?! What the fuck is going on?! SOMEONE HELP ME!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The Unknown Woman laughs as she stops walking towards him.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnknown Woman: What's wrong, don't you like this form? I thought you'd enjoy it. Everyone always seems to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The videographer pans away again and continues to crawl away. He is screaming for help as loud as he can.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnknown Woman: *Scoughs*  Fine. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*As she finishes her sentence the Unknown Woman's voice drastically changes. The Videographer turns back to look at her as her voice changes.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnknown Woman: No reward for you then! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*She suddenly begins to change, her face develops two large fans and pedipalps, her abdomen elongates and moves back as it forms four long legs. The majority of her body is enveloped with dark brown fur as she continues towards the videographer. The camera looks her up and down as she fully transforms into a huge horrific spider with the torso of a woman on top of it.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The videographer begins to scream hysterically, his voice going raw, and tries to crawl away, as he does this one of her long legs grabs him.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer: WHAT THE FUCK, LET ME GO, LET ME GO. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The creature begins to laugh as it stands directly above him.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCreature: What\u2019s wrong handsome? Don't you like my true form? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*As the creature speaks she stabs the back of her abdomen into his chest, the videographer lets out a loud grunt in pain. His breath begins to slow.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideographer*: Weakly* What did you...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCreature: Don\u2019t try to speak, your entire body will be paralyzed in a few seconds handsome. I do appreciate you wanting to help me, so nice to know there are good people in the world still. Although I have to be honest, it\u2019s not me your helping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Suddenly a sound comes from the right of the camera. The videographer turns just enough so that the camera can see the cave covered in an unnatural amount of webbing from before, just as thousands of small spiders come racing out of it and towards him. He lets out a weak scream and slowly turns back to face the creature standing above him.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCreature: It\u2019s nothing personal, but my children must feed. I knew it was only a matter of time before some strong heroic type would come to the aid of the damsel in distress. Don\u2019t fight it, just close your eyes and this will all be over soon. Don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t feel a thing. Well aside from my children tearing into your flesh! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The creature laughs hysterically as it bends down to kiss the videographer then turns to walk away. Its long legs move in frightening unison quickly carrying her out of frame. Her horrific laugh can be heard fading as she moves away.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The videographer lets out a very weak scream that is barely a breath as the sound of movement is heard. The only image that is seen on the camera feed again, are thousands of tiny legs.*","19":"I don't believe I'll ever be able to drive alone at night again... \n\nLast week I took a trip up to visit some friends in Idaho. A couple of them had moved there about a year ago for cheaper rent and to get away from bigger concentrated areas of people. I was excited to visit them because I had never been to Idaho before, and was even considering moving there as well. This is no longer the case. \n\nThe city they live in has a whopping population of about 1,000, which was a real trip to be around. Extremely friendly people though. If you go to a grocery store, make sure to account for the extra time it takes for the checker to have at least a 5 min conversation with each customer in line, because everyone knows everything about everyone. And if you\u2019re from out of state, get ready for a real in-depth interview. \n\nI had gone to pick up some drinks to take back to their house for the evening. After Jamison the cashier had finally finished up his lengthy inquiry with me, I walked out to my shitty, dust covered van and saw that he had talked to me right through the remaining sun left in the sky. I wasn\u2019t too thrilled about this because I already wasn\u2019t the greatest night driver. On top of that, when you get away from any main streets going towards homes, the roads no longer have lines and every single one feels like they\u2019re wide enough for about one and a half vehicles. \n\nIt was about a 20-minute drive back to their place, the majority of that time requiring these types of roads. But I was feeling okay, I drove a slow 10 mph under the limit since there\u2019s no assholes around to tailgate me for once in my life. I made it probably halfway there before I ever saw another vehicle. I merged more to the right, slightly into the dirt, just to make sure this person had more than enough room when we passed each other, then drifted right back to the center of the road. The area was starting to grow on me. People were nice, everywhere was so quiet, and the roads were so much less stressful, even at night. \n\nIronically this was the exact thought in my head when I first saw him. \n\nStreet lights were fully not a thing in this area, so all you had to go off of was your headlights. You saw the next 100 feet in front of you, and that\u2019s it. Darkness to your left and right, save for a few small squares of light from people's windows far off. So, as I\u2019m puttering along, eyes fixated forward, hoping I don\u2019t miss my turn, it took me a moment to realize what was coming into my field of vision. The empty black of the road stretched forward uninterrupted until it reached the legs of a person. It finally clicked what I was seeing and I instinctively put on the breaks. A bit too hard, honestly. My 12-pack tipped on the seat and fell to the floor of the passenger side. I began to reach for it before I snapped back and remembered what caused the topple. \n\nLooking forward I saw a man, standing in the middle of the road. He was rail thin, almost malnourished. Long wiry black hair with a beard to match. But it was his clothes that set me on edge. It looked almost like a poncho, but more of a cloth material. The color reminded me of a puddle of stagnant rusty water. It flapped gently in the wind, making it clear it was the only thing he was wearing, as I kept getting glimpses of more of the same black ungroomed hair below. He stood almost with the vibe of a gunslinger. Like a horrifically demented version of A Fistful of Dollars\u2026\n\nThese observations probably took about 5 seconds in real time, as I sat motionless behind the wheel, and he, motionless on the road. I looked at my phone mounted on the dash, the navigation app said I was 7 minutes away from my friends\u2019 house. I thought about calling them, about dropping my location in a text, or about calling the police. I took a breath and composed myself, thinking it was in all likelihood, just a homeless gentleman, either trying to give me a scare, or just unaware of where he was in that moment.  I released pressure on the brakes and rolled forward a few feet. The guy was probably a couple dozen yards ahead. I had hoped that beginning to move forward would get him to move. I got about 20 feet, and nothing. \n\nI pressed on the brakes again and came to a stop once more. As I stared forward at the guy, my hand slid to the door and I pressed down on the lock buttons. All the doors clicked around me, giving me that lovely false sense of security. My hand then hovered over the horn, but decided against it. I figured that if this person was trying to fuck with me, that some loud sounds wasn\u2019t going to change anything. My right hand was tapping furiously on the steering wheel. I thought about simply flooring it, but as freaked out as I was, I wasn\u2019t much up for running a person down if they were determined to win this game of chicken. Finally, the sensible thought came. I will simply reverse until I was far back enough to turn around without him being able to get to the van. I put my hand on the gearshift as I looked forward at him. I think at this point is where I finally broke the silence and spoke, simply shaking my head and saying to myself, \u201cNope.\u201d \n\nMy gaze shifted towards the rearview, just to see if there happened to be any other headlights coming. As soon as I did, I twisted my torso so quickly in order to look back, that my neck still hurts as I am typing this. Bathed in the red of my tail lights, stood three more people, mere feet from my rear windshield. They all had the same discolored clothing on. I remember letting out a very guttural noise, completely horrified. I spun back to see the original creep, now sprinting full speed towards me, maybe 20 feet away. I heard a bang on the rear glass, and I floored it. The guy in front leaped onto the hood as I accelerated. I looked back and saw the three begin to run after me, as the first scurried up and I began to hear him on the roof. I sped forward until the three behind disappeared into the darkness. More thudding above. I thought about how the roof racks were probably being used for the first time since I bought this van. Once I was about a quarter mile down the road, I slammed on the breaks. The van skidded forward and began drifting towards the dirt to the left. If I went off the road, I was done for. I managed to turn the wheel enough to keep me right on the edge. But I didn't see or hear anything fall off. I froze for a moment, what the fuck do I do now? \n\nIf I tried the same thing, I could easily lose control of the vehicle. If I drove the rest of the way back, I could be putting my friends in danger. The guy looked like a strong breeze would have broken him in half, but he was managing to van surf with ease. I looked back again, making sure his buddies weren\u2019t catching up yet. I decided it was time to call someone. I reached for my phone and with my hands shaking I tried to get to my friend\u2019s number. Frantically tapping, I finally managed to hit the call button. I brought the phone up to my ear, and as it rang, I still heard tapping. I lowered the phone for a moment, and heard it clearer. It sounded like it was coming from the left. I was petrified to look, but knew I had to. Eyes first, I began turning my now throbbing neck towards the window. At first, there was nothing but empty darkness. I could still hear the dial tone from my phone. Then, from the top of the window, I saw a dirty pale finger lower into view and-\n\ntaptaptap\n\nI managed to completely twist in my seat, feet now up against the driver door, my back curving around the center console. I was losing control of my breathing, well on the way to hyperventilating. Even if I hung up and tried the police, no one was getting to me in time. \n\ntaptaptaptaptaptap\n\nIt was so terrifying and yet seemingly polite. Like \u201cSorry to bother you, just wondering if I could kill you real quick!\u201d I started to faintly hear the voicemail message of my friend, and I looked down to end the call.\n\nTAPTAPTAPTAPTAP\n\nAll four disgusting fingers now. At this point, I knew I needed to go. My best shot was to get back to the house. I began repositioning myself back as silently as I could, whatever this guy was waiting for, I didn\u2019t want to jumpstart it. As I looked forward, trying to steady my breath, I saw the light of God in front of me. \n\nAnd by that, I mean a pair of headlights were coming into view. Tears began to form in my eyes instantly. I reached forward and began flashing my high beams off and on. I began to hear movement on the roof again and quickly I saw the figure drop off onto the ground to the left. He got to his feet and began running straight into the darkness away from the road. Three seconds... and he was gone. \n\nThe headlights grew closer and brighter. My entire body shaking now, the vehicle slowed as it approached and came to a stop with their driver side window next to my passenger window. It was a midsize pickup truck. The window rolled down and I looked to see the most farmer looking farmer ever to exist. I could hear him asking if I was alright, muffled through the glass. I managed to peel my hand off the wheel and touch the window button for a millisecond, just enough to crack the passenger window. I remember trying to warn him, \u201cThere\u2019s somebody out here, it\u2019s not safe, go home.\u201d But I imagine all he heard was \u201cTherSomGHome!\u201d\n\nIt was at this point that I pressed down slowly on the accelerator, and began down the road once more. I\u2019ve never experienced silence like I did for those last seven minutes. When I finally pulled into the driveway, I put the van in park. I sat there motionless for who knows how long. It wasn\u2019t until my friend finally opened the door to investigate the headlights shining through his window that I quickly killed the engine, jumped out and ran to the door. It took a good hour for me to be able to get the entire story out to them. And my friends, being the solid support system they are, didn\u2019t believe a god damn word I said. \n\nThat is of course until the sun finally came up... and they saw the handprints and scuffs all along the dust covered hood and roof.","20":"\n\u201c$100 for each chapter seems reasonable. What do you want me to write about?\u201d I say to the woman, who reached out to me on Reddit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to send you home movies of the three of us and I want you to write one of your typical stories, where my husband, daughter, and myself are the main characters.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have any special subject or narrative that you want me to follow?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, all I want you to do is really study the home movies, that I\u2019ll send you, so you can  really encapsulate our personalities.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are aware that all of my stories have some type of dark twists to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, perfect I do!\u201d\n\nI hung up the phone and felt satisfied with actually earning money for writing something.  Thus far, my degree in English hasn\u2019t brought me anything more than a monthly student loan bill.  The security job I have requires no college degrees and only pays $9.00 an hour.\n\nThe good thing about my job is that I get to write pretty much for my entire shift.  Besides occasionally opening the gate to the upscale housing development I work for, I am afforded about seven hours of writing time.\n\nShe\u2019s going to overnight the home movies to me, which should arrive by tomorrow.\n\nAs I\u2019m trying to fall asleep, I think to myself, that this might be the big break that I\u2019ve been looking for, where people ask me to write fictional novels with them being the main characters.\n\nI wake up the next morning hoping that the movies arrive before I have to go to work.  As long as they do, then I can watch them in my guard shack at work.\n\nI was starting to get a little nervous then I heard the delivery truck pull up.\n\nWith little time to spare I gathered the movies and drove to work.\n\nI arrive at work and put the first movie titled, \u201cAt Home\u201d in the player.\n\nI see a 10 year old girl watching television with her father, while the mother video tapes the both of them and asks them questions.\n\nThe movie finishes and I put in two more in, where I really get a good glimpse into the family\u2019s unique personalities.  Mom seems like she\u2019s in charge and dad seems to be the peace maker, and the daughter seems to push both of their buttons.\n\nWhen I was younger, me and my family visited a ghost town in Montana called Garnet.  The town was steeped on top of this narrow rustic gravel road, that was at least seven miles long and made going faster than 20 miles per hour impossible without falling off the side of the cliff.\n\nOnce you get to where the ghost town is located,  you are really in the middle of nowhere, where it would take at least an hour and a half for the police to come rescue someone.  There is zero cell phone reception, so I\u2019m not even sure how someone would contact them if there was an emergency.\n\nThe plot of the movie is similar to The Shining, where the father finds an unopened bottle of alcohol in the ghost town and the mix of his wife constantly bossing him around and his alcohol fueled rage makes him go insane.  A cat and mouse game ensues in the ghost town, where the mother finds an old miners pick axe and is able to kill her rage infested husband.  The story ends with the mother being panicked, where she races down the hill and loses control of the car, which kills both her and her daughter.\n\nI was able to scrape out four chapters for a total of $400 which I actually received through the mail, when I emailed  her my stories and mailed her home movies back.\n\nSurprisingly, the woman was happy with my story and she said that she would call me back in the near future with the potential to earn more money, if I wrote more stories for her.\n\nWithin the month, I received another phone call from the woman, where she said her rich friends in her community, where she lives, want me to do stories about their family\u2019s.\n\nI would do the same thing where I would watch the home movies at my security job, then I would write a story about the family.\n\nThe next one had to do with an ultra religious family who makes an uncharacteristic trip to Las Vegas where mom gets hooked on gambling.  The mother actually sells her two kids two a Nevada cult she meets at one of the casinos, where both her and her husband die in the desert trying to rescue her kids.\n\nThings were going good where I was making an extra $400 - $500 a week selling my stories to the woman who reached out to me on Reddit.\n\nPart of me was thinking that she was reselling my stories to the original families for an up-charge, but I didn\u2019t care because I was being paid a respectable amount of money.\n\nI got to the point where I had written seven stories and I was starting to upgrade my lifestyle with leasing a new car and I moved into a nicer apartment.\n\nThen when I was attempting to do a Google search, I saw a really odd story come up on Google\u2019s main search page.  The story was about a husband and wife who were suspected of stumbling  upon their sacrificed kids in the Nevada desert, where the husband and wife were killed as well.\n\nThe story alluded to \u201c \u2026 one of many Nevadas cults are suspected of carrying out the heinous crime.\u201d\n\nI thought to myself, that there was a reason why I chose Las Vegas and Nevada, because something like that occurring isn\u2019t beyond the realm of possibilities.  \n\nHowever, when I typed in Garnet, Montana, I became physically sick when I read a recent news story \u201c \u2026 police are still baffled on what happened at the ghost town, where a father was found murdered with a pick axe and his wife and daughter were found dead on a side of a cliff.\u201d\n\nI became physically I\u2019ll when I saw pictures of the the Family that died in the ghost town and I got even sicker when I went back and found pictures of the family that died in Nevada.  \n\nIt got worse and worse when I typed into Google, the five other stories that I had written, where each one of my stories were acted out in real life.  \n\nThe worst part about all of this is my email is Matt_[redacted]@google.com and I emailed all of my stories to this crazed woman using that email address.\n\nI had no idea on what to do and I knew it was Friday and she was going to call me because she calls me every Friday for over a month now.\n\nI see a blocked number come up on my phone so I know that it\u2019s her.\n\n\u201cListen here you psychopath, I\u2019m reaching out to the police!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you Matt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to do me a favor.  I want you to type the address in where I had you sent back those home movies.\u201d\n\nAs I was fuming in anger, I typed in the address and a Catholic Church came up in Colorado.\n\n\u201cWhy did you have me send the tapes to a church?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I knew the stereotypical old person working in the rectory wouldn\u2019t know what to do with them and the delivery service wouldn\u2019t take it back, so all of those tapes are just sitting there waiting for me to tell them what they actually are.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are they?\u201d I angrily responded.\n\n\u201cThey are home movies from a twisted serial killer, named Matt [redacted], who was brazen enough to leave his return address on each package he mailed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll just tell the police that I was being paid to write stories from the home movies I received from you!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho am I Matt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re \u2026 uh uh \u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019ve been calling my number!\u201d I say in a frustrated angry tone.\n\n\u201cAnd what number have I been calling you on?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell the police have the technology to trace your number regardless.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean on the public pay phones I\u2019ve been using? You do smoke pot, right Matt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but just about everyone else does!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and how many times have you used or called a public pay phone to get in contact with your dealer?\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides a misdemeanor drug charge, I don\u2019t have a criminal record!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see! A loner drug addict, who works alone as a security \nguard, who writes weird stories on Reddit.  That seems like a potential serial killer or a murderer to me!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat proof do you have?\u201d\n\n\u201cEmails of your stories and I\u2019m sure you have done Google searches of Garnet, Death Valley, Nevada and all the other places as well!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell there\u2019s no evidence of me being in any of those places!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou picked some pretty secluded places, like the Nevada desert, where there wouldn\u2019t be much of a trail!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe police always find evidence of who killed the people!\u201d\n\n\u201cMatt, you know that you moved recently, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yeah!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you threw away some of your old clothes and other Knick knacks that you didn\u2019t want?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cPieces of you were found by the police in Death Valley, Rocky Mountain National Park, and wherever else you wrote a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sick twisted bitch!\u201d\n\n\u201cHmmm, that\u2019s not really nice language to use. Maybe I should forward your emails to the police or call that church that has those home movies with your address on them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWait! Don\u2019t do that!  What do you want from me?\u201d\n\n\u201cA new story Matt!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy so you could kill another family? Who are you working with? Because you can\u2019t be working alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the person who holds your fate and determines whether or not you\u2019ll fry in the electric chair or return to your lowly security job!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t use the electric chair anymore!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay then you\u2019ll sit on death row until they kill you by lethal injection! Bye Matthew.\u201c\n\nThen, she hung up the phone.  I write down notes of what she sounded like, which resembled a voice of a maybe, 30 something year old woman.  The odd part was that she didn\u2019t use any slang, so she was probably college educated and not some two- bit junkie or something like that, but what do I really know?\n\nI feel so alone and scared, as I have no one to turn to ask for advice.  \n\nI could go see a lawyer who will laugh at me, when I show them my $900 that I have saved up or I could go to the police who might arrest me on the spot.\n\nI\u2019m literally pulling my hair out thinking what I should do.\n\nShe said that she or whoever else went through my trash where I used to live, so she may not live far from me or did she or one of her accomplices make a special trip to where I lived?\n\nI can\u2019t go to sleep because of all of these thoughts, I have going through my head.\n\nThe worst part is seeing those images on the home movies of those kids and their families and then knowing the horridness of how they died.\n\nI woke up in a panic as I must of drifted off for a couple of hours.\n\nI wrote those darn stories, so now I can\u2019t get those horrific images out of my head.\n\nI know there must be evidence of this woman\u2019s existence somewhere, so I post on Reddit \u201cHas anyone been offered to write a story using someone\u2019s home movies?\u201d\n\nI really don\u2019t want to go to work, but I know I have to, because I don\u2019t want to cause any attention onto myself.\n\nAs I wait for a response on Reddit, my mind goes wild thinking that maybe that woman is one of those rich bitches that lives in one of the houses in the development, where I man the front gate?\n\nI get in my car and head into work and I\u2019m so flustered that I drop my phone out of my right pocket which lands in between my car seat and the middle console.\n\nI reach down in between the  seat and I get my phone along with a receipt.\n\nI look at the receipt and I see that it\u2019s a cash receipt for gas in Henderson, Nevada.  \n\nI instantly think that receipt was planted by that crazy bitch, but then I get an image of myself with the desert in the background, while I\u2019m pumping gas.\n\nI\u2019ve been so sleep deprived that I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m mixing images of those home movies with images of the online news stories with images of the actual stories that I\u2019ve written.\n\nMy mind is collapsing on itself where I can\u2019t differentiate fact from fiction.  I start to get these loose images almost like I have to fix the rabbit ears on a tv to get any kind of resemblance of the images in my head.\n\nI see a grainy image of myself in my head, breaking into a house and stealing items like home movies.\n\n\u201cNo Stop It!\u201d I say to myself as I\u2019m so stressed out that I\u2019m loosing my sense of reality.\n\n\u201cWhat type of insurance do you have?\u201d I hear echoed in my head, as I attempted to go to urgent care a few weeks ago, when I couldn\u2019t get the images of my stepdad out of my head.  \n\n\u201cIf your not a danger to anyone and you have no insurance, then we can\u2019t help you here!\u201d  I remembered the nurse practitioner at the urgent care saying to me.\n\nI quickly look at my phone\u2019s history and see that I received a phone call from a blocked number, so I know that insane  woman called me.\n\nBut, then I think to myself, was that a real phone call or was that some woman I made up in my head?\n\nI can\u2019t go to work. I need to sleep.  The stress of everything is making me not think straight.","21":"My story begins on a Friday night at my friend's huge mansion where he sometimes hosts these parties. I\u2019ll call him Jacob  -  for the purposes of this story. His parents were out on a weekend vacation together and had basically no idea what was going on at their place.   \n\n\nWe were\/are all mostly underage at the time, and the party had alcohol, smokes, some weed as well, which was legal in our state but *none* of our parents allowed, so we had to keep it under the radar. There were eleven of us, including me, and we all knew each other pretty well; part of the same general friend group, all that. \n\n  \nI had a lot of fun, as I usually did at any of Jacob\u2019s parties. He was the sort of person who really knew how to throw a great party. The giant house helped, and did the pool tables, mini bar, sizable TV and outside swimming pool. It was pretty great being friends with this guy.   \n\n\nIt started with a feeling of being watched. I don\u2019t know exactly when I first noticed it, and I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it at first.  \n\n\nThe thing is, this house was old. Sometimes you would hear \u2018house settling\u2019 sounds. Also, a good portion of the house wasn\u2019t used for much, so it could be kind of creepy sometimes. I figured this was just a side effect. \n\n  \nI remember at one point during the night, I could have sworn I saw someone peeking out from behind one of the doorways near the top of the stairs; a person with hollow eyes and a long, thin nose. Their teeth were bared out in a wide grimace.   \n\n\nI blinked a few times, trying to focus on it, but it was too dim up there for me to be sure. After a while, I thought I saw it crawl away, disappearing from view in a few, rapid movements. \n\n  \nI was pretty drunk, and I convinced myself I was just seeing things. Now, thinking back on everything that happened after, I\u2019m not as sure. But at the time, it didn\u2019t take long for me to sink back into my alcohol induced haze and mostly forget about it. \n\n  \nSome time later, I was shocked into reality as a sound pierced the background music and lull of conversation around me; a scream coming from one of the nearby bathrooms. A few people jumped up to go investigate and see if someone needed help. \n\n  \nA girl practically ran into them as they were heading for the source of the noise. She told them she had gone to use one of the bathrooms and there had been a guy waiting right inside the door. He had jumped on top of her as soon as she walked inside and bit her. Fortunately, she knew a bit of self defence and managed to fight him off pretty quickly. She thought she saw the guy leave through the bathroom window as she was running out.\n\n  \nShe had to go to a hospital. I got a glimpse of her injury as one of the other girls was guiding her out of the house. It was pretty bad. She told us the guy had literally bitten off a piece of her arm. It was covered with a completely blood soaked cloth. Her hands were trembling, and her face was twisted into a grimace. It made me a little queasy just thinking about her injury.   \n\n\nWe weren\u2019t all in agreement about whether to the police - if it meant getting us into a bit of trouble for being caught with the alcohol and weed. Jacob was antsy about it and protested saying he was going to have big problems with his parents. We eventually decided we had to though, as we figured the police were going to find out anyway through the girl the man had attacked. \n\n  \nThe police arrived a few minutes later. They were actually pretty nice to us. They did a search of the whole house; but the search came up clear and they said whoever it was must have left. The worst thing they really made us do was to call our parents and clean up the mess.   \n\n\nMost of the people at the party were picked up by their parents and taken home. It was clear none of us were in a state to drive home, and some of our parents agreed to pick us up in the morning instead, since it was so late.  \n\n\nJacob had plenty of spare bedrooms, so me and four or so others ended up crashing there for the night.\n\n  \nAt this point, I was still half out of it from all the drinking. I was more than happy to pick the first guest bedroom I found, lie down, and fall asleep almost immediately. \n\n  \nI had only been passed out for what felt like one or two hours before I was woken up again by the sound of music. At first, I assumed there were some people still partying downstairs, but then I remembered that everyone else was already asleep by the time I had settled down for the night. I was positive that no one left music on, and the music I was hearing wasn\u2019t the kind of thing you play at parties. It was a Tiny Tim song on loop; lighthearted, but kind of creepy.   \n\n\nSo I got up, thinking I would go out and ask whoever it was who was playing the music to turn it off, since it was fairly loud and kind of annoying. I opened the door and made my way through a short hallway and up to this landing overlooking the living room where Jacob and everyone else had been hanging out, ready to yell at whoever had turned the music back on. \n\n  \nAnd I stopped short. \n\n  \nStanding below me, their back turned away, was a thin and very gaunt looking old man, dancing along to the Tiny Tim music. He was moving slowly around the room, waltzing with one hand held out like there was someone else there dancing along with him. His actions were awkward and jerky, his movements slightly off beat to the music. I caught sight of his face briefly a few times as he twirled around. He had this disturbing, pained smile fixed on; his eyes were bloodshot and he held a starved expression like he hadn\u2019t eaten in days. \n\n  \nI couldn\u2019t stop myself from staring. The sight was almost too absurd to even be scary at first, and I just kept wondering what the hell he was doing in the house and whether I knew him or something. I was still too drunk - and stupid, to immediately see any danger in the situation. \n\n  \nAnd then he finally noticed me. He sort of stopped, freezing in the middle of dancing, his arms and body still mid movement, his gaze fixed onto me. I froze too, and I suddenly realised what an idiot I had been standing there watching an intruder dance around the house. That was also when I remembered what happened to that girl who went to hospital, and I realized this had to be the same person who attacked her. \n\n  \nThat moment of staring stretched on for what felt like an eternity, during which time I found myself trying to find some hint of sanity in his deranged eyes. Then this man, he bent down and started bear-crawling on his hands and feet toward me, rapidly gaining speed until he was moving almost inhumanly fast, that same ravenous look still on his face.   \n\n\nI think that was the moment reality fully hit me. I got the hell out of there, running straight back to my room as fast as I could, screaming and yelling the whole way. I could hear whoever it was crawling after me, making a large amount of noise as they moved up the stairs and across creaky floorboards.   \nIn my panic, I didn\u2019t think I could make it to the bedroom in time without the man catching me, so I threw myself into the closest room instead; the bathroom, and slammed the door behind me. \n\n  \nMy first thought was that I should call the police again, but then I realised I had left my phone downstairs during the party last night, so I didn\u2019t have it with me. I listened to see if I could hear any sound from the other side of the door. I thought I caught a faint scratching noise coming from outside my room, but nothing that told me for certain if he was out there. \n\n  \nI sank down against the door. My head was throbbing and I felt pretty sick, like I was going to throw up. I still couldn\u2019t fully wrap my head around what had just happened.  \n\n\nAs it turned out, the man must have eventually left, because after a while, I noticed the music had stopped. Soon after that, I heard one of my other friends trying the door, and then knocking softly. I didn\u2019t move until I heard them call out to me.\n\n  \nI told them they could come in. The friend, who I\u2019ll call Jamie, asked if I was alright and then what happened.   \n\n\nI tried my best to explain everything to him. Halfway through my explanation, the music started up again from downstairs: that same bloody Tiny Tim song. \n\n  \nJamie, who actually did have his phone, immediately called the police again and then went back to wake up everyone else as quietly as he could. I went with him. In a few minutes, there were four of us huddled together in another one of the rooms, including me. A sober mood had settled over all of us.   \n\n\nJamie assured us the police would arrive in a few minutes; so we wouldn\u2019t have to wait long. Most of my friends were more confused than freaked out at that stage. Someone else complained about us all getting into more trouble, and Jacob was irritated at us for getting the police involved again. But knowing the police were coming was a big comfort to me. I was still thinking about how close that man had come to catching me.  \n\n  \nAnd then a girl, Ellie, spoke up, her voice panicked. \n\n  \n\u2018Wait,\u2019 she said, \u2018where\u2019s Luna?\u2019 \n\n  \nWe were sitting together in the room, me on the bed and the rest of us on the floor. We all looked at each other. There was a short silence. \n\n  \nJacob finally asked, sounding slurred, \u2018she didn\u2019t stay here. She didn\u2019t come up with us to crash in one of the bedrooms, right?.\u2019 \n\n  \n\u2018I never saw her leave,\u2019 Ellie replied. \u2018Last time I checked, I think she was passed out on one of the couches\u2026 Downstairs.\u2019 \n\n  \nShe trailed off. \u2018*Shit!\u2019* she said. \n\n  \n\u2018Did you see her, Frank?\u2019 Ellie asked, quickly turning to me. \n\n  \nI shook my head apologetically. \u2018I didn\u2019t get a good look, all I really saw was the intruder. I have no idea if she\u2019s down there. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 \n\n  \nI was still trying to think of something else to say when she stood up abruptly and moved to the door.   \n\u2018Ellie, what the hell are you doing?\u2019, Jamie demanded, watching her. She ignored him and opened the door, stepping out cautiously into the hallway, toward the sound of the music still echoing up to us from downstairs. A few of us, including me, began to edge out after her. \n\n  \n\u2018The police told us to stay put, Ellie,\u2019 Jamie hissed at her. \n\n  \n\u2018I have to see if she\u2019s okay,\u2019 was Ellie\u2019s short reply. \n\n  \nShe stopped at the end of the hallway, where it opened out on the small area overlooking the room below. I was behind her, but too far away to see much of the hall myself, so I had no idea what she was seeing; only her reactions to it. \n\n  \nI held my breath, waiting there, watching her. After nearly a minute, Jamie yanked Ellie back into the safety of the hallway.   \n\n\n\u2018She\u2019s not there,\u2019 Ellie whispered, glancing back at us. \u2018But that man, I saw *him*. It looked like there was blood on him. And he was\u2019 - she grimaced at this - \u2018he was licking his *lips*.\u2019 \n\n  \n\u2018It could be Lil\u2019s blood from when he bit her,\u2019 Jamie said in a low voice. \u2018Look, we can\u2019t do anything about it now.\u2019 \n\n  \nEllie didn\u2019t look very convinced by that, and I didn\u2019t blame her. Jamie reminded her that the police would be a lot better equipped to help her than any of us were, and that seemed to persuade her enough to step away from the balcony. He urged her back into the hall quietly and we all retreated to the safety of one of the bedrooms. The look in her eyes remained as we returned to our hiding place.   \nThe police arrived a few minutes later. We heard them knocking on the door to the back of the house and calling out to us. Jamie had suggested asking the police to come in from the back so we could avoid the intruder spotting us. \n\n  \nWe could still hear the music playing as we snuck downstairs, making sure to keep our distance from the party room where I had seen the man, and let the police in. \n\n  \nThe police searched the house thoroughly., and this time, the surrounding area, too. They never found the intruder. He must have left when he heard them coming. \n\n  \nThey discovered some bloodstains on the floor, but that was only evidence the intruder had ever been there at all. \n\n  \nThe bloodstains were later identified as being Luna\u2019s. She was declared as missing shortly after. There was a whole investigation to try and find her. I was never too close to her, but Ellie was absolutely devastated by it.   \n\n\nYou would have expected this insane man left fingerprints or something else the police could identify him with. The police did search for that. And they did find some unidentified prints, but never had success linking them to anybody. Since there wasn\u2019t much else to go on to find who the intruder was besides a few questionable descriptions from us, the focus of the search was turned to finding Luna - or whatever happened to her.\n\n  \nTwo weeks passed with absolutely no sign of her. All we could do was pray that she was okay. We knew the intruder must have kidnapped her, and we could only assume that maybe she escaped, or at least, that the police would find and rescue her. \n\n  \nWe held onto hope for all of those two full weeks.   \n\n\nThat leads me to the last part of this story. When Jacob discovered her. From here on, I only have his account to go on, and from what I\u2019ve heard, I\u2019m glad I wasn\u2019t there to see it for myself. \n\n  \nJacob came home from another day at school like he normally did. He went straight upstairs to put his stuff away and change. \n\n  \nHe noticed the smell before he even opened the door to his room, I remember he told me. It made him sick. It was so bad it was difficult for him not to throw up right after walking in. \n\n  \nJacob started immediately searching for the source of the smell. That was when he opened the closet, and the body fell out. \n\n  \nIt was Luna.  Her body was grey, swollen and partially decayed, but still recognizable. That guy had somehow managed to get back into the house and left her there for Jacob to find. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still can\u2019t quite believe it; what happened to her. That the person Jacob described seeing is the same person I used to sometimes hang out with and talk to at school from time to time. It just doesn\u2019t seem real.   \n\n\nI might not have fully believed his story if I hadn\u2019t heard it confirmed in a police report.   \n\n\nI just can\u2019t imagine what Jacob must have felt when he found her like that. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s recovered from it yet. I haven\u2019t seen much of him since we talked about it.  \n\n  \nSo, that\u2019s my story. Thankfully, there hasn\u2019t been any sign of that sick cannibal who invaded Jacob\u2019s house. Jacob\u2019s got some new security anyway, to make sure there isn\u2019t another incident like that again. Although I still don\u2019t think I\u2019m going back there for any parties any time soon.    \n\n\nI still remember the details of the whole night so vividly. Sometimes I remember the look in his eyes when he first saw me; and I wonder what would have happened if I was a little bit slower that night, whether I would still  be here right now, or whether it would be my body that fell out of the closet in Jacob\u2019s room.","22":"2 hours ago i was with two of my friends we'll call them marco and polo for the sake of their privacy. \nWe were chilling in a coffeeshop then we got bored and decided to head out for a walk before we go home it was 8:30 pm \/ 20:30 and we wondered around for a bit before we sat to this skate park. We we're having a laugh at some dumb stories that we were talking about then at the corner of my eye i see this clean middle aged woman. She had a buzz cut and wearing shining glasses and was asking a guy that was sitting by himself a few feet away from us for money he said no and went back to his phone then she processeded to head to us to ask us now here's where it gets creepy. She had this look of a calm person w no emotions on her face literally none not a single muscle of her face moved beside her moth obviously she reached out to me i had some spare to give but for some reason i had the urge to not touch her just sort of let the money fall into her hand due to covid and stuff. so i did that that made her look like we pissed her off like we didn't do something that she was planing i smiled and told her to have a good night she looked at me dead through my eye and straight into my soul and said nothing at that moment i felt like this huges dark thing that i can't even describe entering my body and start to swollow me from the inside out i felt like my heart was going to expload or something is going to expload it's like having a panic attack. I got shivers out of it so i decieded to play it off by telling what i felt to my friend so they could laugh at me and i laugj with them and that's it but i as soon as i say that marco jumps out of his place and started walking very fast and telling us to gtfo as soon as possible he had the same feeling polo wasn't really affected as much as we are but he was mildly disturbed by her presence as we went away from her we can see her asking for money but her eyes were still on us then she started to our way so we booked it back home. We stopped for a bit and marco told me that he felt the exact same thing and he didn't wanna day anything until i said it so it confirmed whatever happend isn't only happening to him or me. \nPS: to clarify I'm a tunisian guy as a third world country and a high rste of poverty people who are homeless are usually aren't that dressed as her \nAnd since we're an arabic country a woman with shaved head look bit odd i mean it's acceptable but kind of taboo at the same time \nWe still don't know  what in the actual fuck happened back there and if you have any theory please don't hesitate to comment.","23":" I was ten when I started my career as a volunteer dog walker at the local shelter. By the time I was fourteen I was an expert at recognizing dog behavior and I was able to deal with some of the most difficult classes. So when I took a very active dog with small dog aggression issues on a long walk next to the forest no one was questioning my decision. Bradley was an amazing dog and I would adopt him in a heartbeat if we didn't have an older dog at home. I knew that he had a family meeting tomorrow so I was making sure that if this was our last walk together, I'd make it as special as I can.\n\nWalking besides the forest always reminded me of the town legend. I heard from a reliable source of course, that many many years ago a group of people came here and settled down. They made friends with the natives and asked them about the forest. The Natives said that the forest was special and sacred and they should not venture inside unless it is absolutely necessary. All was well until a young family went missing. A man of the settlers, his native wife and their young daughter went to the forest and disappeared. The settlers were enraged, especially when natives told them there was nothing to do, that the young family was claimed by the forest and its inhabitants. But the inhabitants had a secret of their own. It is said they summoned their God, an old creature who was forgotten by all except one family. The settlers sacrificed their own blood and walked the trails in the forest to bind their old God into the land itself, to make sure the forest would be safe for them and their descendants. They failed. Legend has it that their God never showed up but something else did and it took the entire settlement with it.\n\nIt was supposed to be an old story about a boogeyman in the forest and how Jesus Christ is the only god we should pray to. Yet, every year at the equinox a bunch of people gather and walk the trails around the forest. They talk and gossip and occasionally lose a drop of blood in some places. The entire town gathers to escort them to their path and the entire town throws a party when they come back. It is one of the most cherished town traditions and it is always a huge party. Other than that, the forest is woefully boring. We have an occasional missing person, an occasional corpse, we had some drowned college kids in the lake, but nothing that would say sacrifice to the old God or nothing in a certain time period. I myself walked the trails several times with my parents or my sister. It was simply a nice tradition to remember all the people who lived here before and will live here after us. Of course when I asked what happened to the natives after the settlers disappeared I was met with a very generic answer. They moved somewhere south and met their end during one of the massacres. I continued to question how we know the legend then, of the summoning of the old God? My own mother shushed me and simply said that maybe someone survived and that I need to stop asking stupid questions. And so I did.\n\nI loved the forest, especially when walking next to it. It had the most amazing walking path, wide and well taken care of. I could even take rollerblades and run the dogs on the path if I wanted to. I was thinking about just that when Bradley started barking. That's when I noticed that someone with dogs was walking straight to us. Bradley was especially bad, so instead of making things hard, I decided to make a turn right and walk into the forest. Bradley was so surprised that he didn't complain and simply followed.\n\nIt was a beautiful autumn afternoon, sunny with a slight wind and the trees were making their swooshing noises. I stopped to pet Bradley telling him what a good dog he was, when I heard singing. I stopped breathing for a second. It was probably some other walker, singing on the walking path. But it was coming from the other direction, deep into the forest. I turned around and the path was actually quite far already. But one of the trails was right there, so I decided to take the trail and follow the voice. For the life of me I could not understand what it was singing. It must not have been in English, because the further I walked down the trail, the louder the singing became.\n\nThe trail led me all the way to the lake. It was not a very big lake, more of a pond if I'm honest, but people love to call it \u201cThe Lake\u201d. There were a bunch of picnic tables, an old grill, some children's toys and a rock, where you could jump into the lake from. Everyone goes to the lake once in their life, but it was especially known as a teenage make out spot. Of course being only 14 I knew fairly little about that.\n\nI sat on the bench under a tree, still not very close to the lake, just barely off trail, when I noticed a man walking down a different trail. He was looking very ragged and not dressed for a hike in the forest at all. He also seemed to be following the same song as me. When he came closer to the lake that's when I noticed her.\n\nShe was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life. She was also made out of water, see through and I'm pretty sure she was the source of the singing. She appeared in the middle of the lake, slowly ascending from the depths, her hands outstretched and inviting. As soon as I saw her I knew she was singing. I also knew she was not here for me. The song enveloped me as a blanket, poking and prodding until it finally left me as a wind that was blowing one second and then just died out the next. I could not move a muscle or scream or do anything. Bradley cowered under the bench and he was the only thing I felt after the song left me cold and shivering.\n\nThe song was becoming quieter for me, but seemingly not for the man. The woman, now fully erect, walked above the lake to the man, who was walking toward her. They both had their arms stretched out until they finally met on the beach. He was on land and she was on lake, touching each other. She leaned over for a kiss and for that she stopped singing. That's when the man woke up and screamed. But it was far too late. His hands disappeared into hers, and she slowly dragged him onto the lake. She was still floating above the lake, enveloping the man with her own body. She seemed to have grown enough to fully devour the man who seemed to have been drowning inside her.\n\nI was speechless. And absolutely terrified. The whole forest went quiet and I saw the woman turn toward me. At that moment I knew I would die. She would call me. She has called that man and I would drown in her body just as she did. And I couldn't do anything. My body was not moving and I felt tears streaming down my face. I was terrified and Bradley was whimpering under the bench. She came as close as she could while staying on the lake and smiled at me. Her face was absolutely angelic while her body was drowning the poor guy\u2026 she put her fingers on her lips, implying me to be quiet, and slowly descended back underwater.\n\nI don't know how long I sat on that bench. When I looked up it was dark and the full moon was reflecting over the lake. My tears were drying on my cheek and I just realized I could move. I ran. I forgot about Bradley and his leash, I just ran. I missed the wandering trail and just ran to what felt like the right direction of home. I could hear Bradley running with me for a while until he ran ahead of me and just disappeared into the darkness. I stopped to catch my breath when I heard talk. I turned around so fast that my neck hurt. I walked toward the chatter and saw a soft glow.\n\nIt could have been a search party. I had been gone for a while and my parents would be worried. But as soon as I saw them I put my hands on my mouth in order to stop myself from screaming.\n\nThree women dressed in black, a pyre on the side and a fire circle in the middle, they were chanting and dancing. I stood there with my mouth covered, unable to move for the second time today.\n\nThey were absolutely mesmerizing. I have no idea what they were saying but the fire was dancing with them and the land shook when they stopped. They laughed and pointed in the middle of the circle when it started to crack. Steam was rising from the crack and it got bigger and bigger. These women were ecstatic and jumping up and down. I took a step back and hit a tree, but I could not avert my gaze. A long hand appeared from the crack. Long black skinny hand grabbing the earth to pull itself up.\n\nI had had enough so I turned around to quietly run away but even that was blocked. By yet another sight. Flames were bright enough to illuminate a big monster standing in my way. Eight feet tall, humanoid but wrong looking, like his features were too long to be right. His arms were like ape arms reaching all the way to his knees. It didn't notice me as it was entranced with the women in front of him. I prayed to the old God, the new God, to the moon and the stars that it wouldn't notice me. It was entranced by the witches. But as the creature from the crack clawed its way out, steam was pouring out more and more. The monster in front of me got jittery. It turned its head and noticed me. I stayed still. It took a long look at me and then looked at the witches. It turned toward me again as if it was thinking about who was easier prey. It opened its mouth and I saw row after row of sharp teeth. That's when it uttered a word.\n\n*Hungry\u2026*\n\nIt jumped. It was so quick it was like it just disappeared. One second it was in front of me and then it was just gone. Screaming was what finally got me looking at the flaming circle again. I only saw two women now screaming and pointing at something in a tree, but it was too far and too dark for me to see exactly what they were pointing at! But the creature in the flame circle did not care. Several hands were out and a circle was half gone, clearly expecting something bigger to appear. But it was also closing fast and hands were disappearing one after the other, until just one very long one remained. The remaining two women weren't watching, but I was. The long black arm shot out as fast as a snake and grabbed one of the women. It started to pull her through what little of the hole remained and it was pulling her fast. As soon as the last woman noticed she screamed and ran to her rescue. She tried to grab her hands, trying to stop her from being pulled down and I guess it helped a bit. Maybe, just maybe she could be fast enough to stop her friend from going through fully, so only the black hand would be trapped in what was left of the hole. \n\nBut the black hand grew claws and pierced through the flesh of the first woman's chest. The screams that followed were horrendous, more of a gurgle than a scream. The second woman fell on her stomach and was now dragged on the forest floor, following the first into the hole. Laughter filled the air. Laughter of creatures that should never walk the Earth, laughter that sounded like a thousand tiny screams, laughter that makes your ears bleed and makes you think of Hell. The second woman finally let go when only the arms of the first were visible. She let go and the first woman disappeared. The hole filled up and nothing but a clear circle remained. The last woman standing was hitting the earth with both hands, crying and pleading half in English, half in a language I did not understand.\n\nI'd had enough. I turned away from it all and ran away. I had to be careful, half running and half walking in the dead of the night and only the full moon as a light. Though, I was determined to move away from the craziness of that forest.\n\nIt was Bradley's bark that saved me. It must have been at least a few hours since I last saw him but I heard his bark as clear as the bell and I followed it. Bradley was waiting for me on a clearly marked trail and my math teacher was holding his leash. I cried as I ran into his arms knowing I was finally safe. He picked me up as if I was a child, as emotional as I was. He laughed as I cried and demanded to know if I was okay. I couldn't answer.\n\nWe walked outside of the forest where the whole town was waiting for us. I was gone the entire afternoon and most of the night. We watched the sunrise together, praising God that I was safe.\n\nIt was several days later before I told my story to my math teacher. He visited me at home to check how I was doing. He was very insistent that I tell him the true story and not what I told everyone else, that I simply got lost. He knew about what I saw. He had names for the creatures. Rusalka, witches, demons and wendigo. He made a joke about how some people never even meet one and that I must truly be special to have seen each of them. I sat there, in silence, wishing that I just had a vivid dream and that my teacher was making an elaborate joke.\n\nI planned to never step foot in that forest to forget that I was ever in it. It worked for a few months. But just yesterday I got the invitation to participate in the oldest town tradition and to play the role of the bride of the forest during the traditional trail walk.\n\nI'm scared. I want to run away. But forest surrounds the town and there is no way out.","24":"It's not just a few thousand acres that my grandparents own, it seems like they own half of eastern Tennessee everytime I visit in the holidays. There are hiking paths all around the property, and there are even a few spots where you can enjoy some great views of the vast swathes of their land.\n\nIt's well known that Tennessee is the most cavernous state in the US, with the majority of the caves being located in eastern Tennessee, my grandparents' land housed dozens of entrances. So it wasn't hard to find caves and after a few hundred yards into our trip, me and my cousin Mason stumbled across a cave entrance. Mason almost fell into it since it was so nicely disguised amongst the shrubbery.\n\nDespite the fact that we were unprepared for cave exploration, I had already been in dozens of caves on my grandparents' land and we were both a little bit daring, so we decided to give it a go.\n\nWe were preparing to enter the cave when I observed that the cave entrance was littered with the bones of some mammal. We were in such a rush that I simply assumed it was a cow that had died at the entrance and soon we descended down into the cave.\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't pay closer attention to the bones.\n\nIn our excitement, we didn't pause to consider how far we were getting into this strange cave and soon our childish joy propelled us deeper into the subterranean world.\n\nSince the wind was coming from behind us, we enjoyed a steady tailwind as we made our way further into the cavern. It didn't take long for our eyes to adjust, and the light from our flashlights was more than enough to guide us.\n\nBut it was in vain, for almost immediately, the cave appeared to come to a halt.\n\nEven when we paused to relax and speak, I could still feel the powerful tailwind blowing against me. That was when I felt along the wall and found a small opening in the rock, it seemed the cave didn't end after all.\n\nAn unmistakable whistling sound was created by the wind rushing through the crack and I recommended we have a look in the space beyond the crack. Mason agreed and we entered into the darkness of the crack. In addition to being flat on the bottom, the roof of the area was low and I had to totally exhale in order to get through the tiniest part, but we managed.\n\nHonestly, I don't know why I continued walking ahead; I was really scared at this point, but I felt compelled to explore what was on the other side of the crack. I wanted to be the first person to explore a new cave, or maybe find some hidden treasure of some sort.\n\nBut above all, I felt as if something was beckoning me deeper and I had no idea what it was.\n\nIn the larger chamber, I found myself after climbing out of the crack. However, I was unable to hear anything Mason was saying behind me. The wind had been blowing almost consistently up until this point and suddenly stopped, I stood in the cavern, taking it all in.\n\nSeveral boulders were in our way and it was at that moment that I heard it coming from the cave ahead of us. In the darkness, a low scraping of the rocks could be heard and every hair on my body stood up as I froze in place.\n\nMason and I listened intently as we stood there in the deep black darkness and when the scraping halted, we were left standing alone in a profound, unnerving stillness. As the wind picked up again, I felt a headwind coming from deeper in the cave. With the wind came the smell of decomposing flesh mingled with something far worse.\n\nI stumbled backwards and rushed towards the chamber from which I had entered. A few boulder-sized boulders caused me to trip, but I managed to find my way inside the tunnel with only a few scrapes and I assumed Mason was following behind me.\n\nBut yet, Mason was nowhere to be seen when I returned to the cave's entrance and it seemed he wasn't behind me when I escaped the cave. I ran crying to my grandparents' house and soon a search party was sent into the caves to search for Mason.\n\nBut they say the caves stretch for hundreds of miles all over Tennessee and like my grandpa always said to me,\n\nWhen there\u2019s no more room in hell, the horrors will stream upwards and fill the spaces below the earth. That is why man does not fear not the dark itself in these spaces, [but what may lurk within it.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ylodeckard\/)","25":"[Block A](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qpr9aa\/event_apartments_block_a\/)  |  [Block C](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qr8n5t\/event_apartments_block_c\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nApartment block D was the most decrepit. It was also the most dangerous. There had been a fire there at some point. Half the building was still blackened and soot would run off of it when it rained, traveling in thick, syrupy vines down the patchy concrete and into the gravel.\n\nIt was dangerous enough that even we crazed, thrill seeking goblins avoided it for the most part.\n\nAnd when I say \u2018the most part\u2019 I mean with one exception. Kai. D block drew Kai like a moth to a flame. Even though the rest of us wouldn\u2019t go near it- it smelled of smoke and rot and the burnt pieces jutted into the sky like broken bones- we\u2019d find him staring at it sometimes, and every now and again he\u2019d try to talk us into going in.\n\nI don\u2019t know what stopped him from going alone. Kai was never one to be afraid or show fear. Of our crew he was by far the most reckless and danger loving. Maybe he knew whatever was inside was too dangerous for even him- or maybe he just wanted an audience.\n\nI don\u2019t know, but I remember the day it came to a head.\n\nIt had been a week since we\u2019d seen Olivia after our adventure in Block F and we\u2019d gone that morning to see her. Her Aunt had met us at the gate to tell us that Olivia would no longer be coming out with us- and that we were not to come to see her.\n\nIt was for the best, really. I don\u2019t know if she told or if her parents just guessed, or maybe they just noticed the nightmares and disapproved of the lot of us. They weren\u2019t wrong, but the rest of us felt like our little gang had been ruptured. Something had been removed from us like a healthy tooth mistakenly pulled. She was perhaps the most rational and reasonable of us. Normally it was Olivia that talked Kai down out of his latest mad scheme- typically refusing to go anywhere near the death trap that was block D.\n\n\u201cWe should go.\u201d Kai was sitting on the edge of a Block A awning swinging his feet. Badr and Bailey looked at him warily. They were suspicious those days and skittish. As leery as stray dogs.\n\nMischa was leaning on a wall, his arm over Tonya\u2019s shoulders. She rolled her eyes at him- Kai- and looked to Mischa.\n\n\u201cNot this again.\u201d She sighed.\n\n\u201cWe should!\u201d Kai insisted, \u201cWe\u2019ve never been! It\u2019s the only building we haven\u2019t gone in, and now Olivia is never going to. How long before someone else leaves?\u201d\n\nBadr shifted and glanced at his brother. Tonya shifted her mouth to the side and frowned. But Mischa, ever the brave one, shrugged.\n\n\u201cHe has a point. We have to go to school soon.\u201d He and Tonya were older than the rest of us by two years and a year respectively. Word was that they were both going to be sent to more reliable schools soon. Boarding schools. Which meant they wouldn\u2019t be here for apartment forays much longer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just going to bother us if we never know.\u201d Kai pointed out, shimmying around and dropping off the edge of the roof.\n\n\u201cCome on! What have we got to lose?\u201d He stood there with his hands on his hips and grinned triumphantly when Mischa finally pushed himself up off the wall. Tonya stood up too, and Badr and Bailey fell into step behind them as always. The twins came to stand in Mischa\u2019s shadow, and I, the last outlier, followed reluctantly behind as we all trooped down to the apartment in the far back.\n\nBlock D.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the sheer heat of that day. It was oppressive, hanging on everything like a sheet. The back of my neck itched with sweat and the endless drone of cicadas seemed to provide a sound effect for the shimmery waves rising off the blacktop.\n\nIt was cold in block E\u2019s shadow- and it was a long, long shadow. It swelled up over us with the foreboding of a tidal wave always just at the edge of striking.\n\nKai practically strutted up to the front door. He didn\u2019t have to bother with a lock- the door itself was long gone. The burnt husk of the doorway hung open, the scaled edges of the charred wood framing the space it had been.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even dark inside. You guys are being big babies.\u201d Kai yelled back at us, \u201cJust come inside already!\u201d\n\nMischa was first to follow him, obviously. Tonya came too, hanging on his arm.\n\nHe was right. The inside *was* barely even dark. The warped boards let light in through almost everything the fire had damaged. One half of the building was in perpetual sunlight. The other half\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like all the others.\u201d I said, trying not to sound afraid and just sounding sullen instead, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see. Can we just go?\u201d Maybe I was also smarting about Olivia\u2019s absence. I\u2019d been nursing a crush on her for years.\n\n\u201cWill you relax? I want to take a look around first!\u201d Kai shot back, heading for the stairs.\n\n\u201cKai-\u201d Edi breathed, \u201cBe careful! Those don\u2019t look safe!\u201d\n\nHe laughed and bounded up them anyway, skipping the ones that had fallen away or bowed inward. He made it look easy. It was not. I shuffled my way up by leaning against the wall and edging across the innermost pieces. The others waited silently to see if I would make it. Aside from Mischa I was the heaviest- so for once I was actually one of the first up instead of dead last.\n\nWhich meant I had the unique privilege of being the only person to see Kai head down the dusty hall and turn a corner.\n\n\u201cKai!\u201d I whined under my breath- an art I had perfected by then- \u201cHOld oN!\u201d My voice warbled and cracked, puberty robbing it of its volume. I reluctantly jogged down toward the enveloping darkness, away from the burnt and sunlit part of the building.\n\n\u201cKai?\u201d Flakes of soot drifted through the air. One landed on the back of my hand and stuck, staining the skin. I tried to scratch it away, looking one direction and then the other.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d Several of the apartments were unlocked. He could have gone in any of them, I remember thinking. I could hear the others coming up the stairs behind me and groaned, calling to them over my shoulder.\n\n\u201cKai ran ahead! I don\u2019t know where he went!\u201d\n\nThe building\u2019s bones shifted. I heard a creak somewhere to the right of me.\n\n\u201cKai!\u201d I just assumed. I followed the sound through the stuffy, sweltering shadows until I found another corner.\n\nThat was the moment my life changed forever. It wasn\u2019t Kai down there.\n\nIt was a woman.\n\nAt the end of the hallway, where the shadows were deepest and the walls were mostly whole. She had long blonde hair matted with something slick and was wearing a pale green peasant dress. She saw me too. The way she looked at me- I can\u2019t explain it. It was more like she saw *through* me. It was a feeling I got, as if she knew *me*. Everything I was. Everything I would be\u2026 and found me lacking.\n\nThe look on her face wasn\u2019t even annoyance. It was a calm indifference. She couldn\u2019t care less about me- or about any of the others coming up behind me. They each got their own version of the exact same look.\n\nExcept for Kai. He must have heard us finally and came around the corner last. After she was done inspecting the others she turned her eyes to him- and that was when I noticed. They weren\u2019t empty. They were *dark*, so I thought at first that they were empty sockets. I didn\u2019t realize until a few seconds later that they were full of sparkle.\n\nGlitter that shifted and dripped down her face when she looked at Kai. I watched a rivulet run down her cheek and I\u2019d never felt more fear than the moment she smiled and held her hand out. Not even when my feet were in the mouth of the thing in block A.\n\nThe darkness moved around her.\n\nI\u2019m not sure who screamed. I think it must have been Bard. I do remember grabbing Kai\u2019s hand when I ran for the stairs, and that all the others were running too. We stampeded for the exit, I don\u2019t know how we all made it down the stairs alive. All I know is that we spilled out into the sunlight gasping and shivering like we\u2019d been in cold, deep water instead of five feet away from the full weight of noon in the middle of summer.\n\nKai wrenched his hand out of my grasp the minute we stopped running and gave me the most insulted, hate-filled look I\u2019d ever seen.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d He demanded. I looked at him speechlessly, fumbling for my inhaler.\n\n\u201cBecause she was bad!\u201d Badr answered for me, Bailey nodding beside him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you feel it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Kai huffed, \u201cYou panicked over nothing! She didn\u2019t even do anything. Why are you all such babies?\u201d That was becoming a more frequent insult from him. As if he were more mature than us- outgrowing us.\n\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Kai flapped his hand at us, \u201cThere was some neat stuff in there. I think I saw a sword. I\u2019m going back in.\u201d\n\nAnd he did. I stood in the sun and watched as he turned around and loped back up the steps and I remember thinking that whatever was in there was as bad as all the things in the other blocks combined. I remember feeling nauseous and cold to my core.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t have gone back in if Mischa hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cKai, it\u2019s not safe- knock it off, let\u2019s go hang out somewhere else!\u201d A rare voice of reason. Normally that would have been Olivia\u2019s role. He sounded more exasperated than scared when he went back to the entrance. Tonya was right beside him, as always, a hand on his bare shoulder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going in.\u201d Badr sniffled. Bailey looked at Badr and he shook his head. He wasn\u2019t going in either.\n\nI was torn- but I felt safe going in as long as Mischa was there, so I followed. And when I looked back I saw Bailey behind me. Badr looked unhappy. Maybe they didn\u2019t want to be left out there on their own. Maybe peer pressure got to them. Either way, when I looked back from the top stairs I realized they were standing in the doorway. Reluctantly coming in.\n\nBailey and I stuck close. I passed every open door with a pang of anxiety, hoping to see Kai- and to not see anything else. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that there was something in each of them. Watching me. Whispering. What little light pierced the gloom seemed bleached gray by the dust and char- leeched of color and never enough to see the whole room with.\n\nSeveral times I thought I saw shapes gathered in the far corners- leaning on the walls and leering.\n\n\u201cKai!\u201d I heard Mischa shout. He sounded close to losing his temper- which was pretty legendary in our small circle. I jumped about a foot and scurried to catch up, Bailey speeding up to stay with me. We both reached the end of the hallway just in time to hear Tonya shout.\n\nIt was a wordless cry of shock and fear. I saw why almost immediately.\n\nThe glitter-eyed woman was halfway down the hall, now. Kai was frozen at our end, mouth hanging open. I want to say with fear, but I just don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t.\n\nMischa grabbed him under the arms and threw him in the direction of the stairs, planting a hand between his shoulder blades and forcing him to run. The rest of us needed no urging. We were gone just as fast as we\u2019d been the first time. Except I was always the slowest, and I\u2019ll never forget reaching the stairs and looking back and seeing her there.\n\nAt the corner of \u2018her\u2019 hallway, looking down into our\u2019s.\n\nThis time when we stumbled out we headed straight for the edge of the complex. Kai kept looking back, I remember that. But he didn\u2019t go back that day. At least, I don\u2019t think he did. I wouldn\u2019t know, honestly, because the very next day I came down with something that had me in bed for the next three days. The fever and chills were terrible- the worst I\u2019d ever had- and I was so tired when they finally passed that it was another three days before I could bring myself to venture out of the house.\n\nIt turned out I wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019d come down with that bug, either. All of the gang had, and now it was sweeping through the town. Just some summer bug. No one died of it- not that I heard about- but it made the whole city miserable for about a month before it passed.\n\nWe met up something like a week and a half later. None of us were really up to venturing down to the apartment complex yet, so we\u2019d simply gathered in the brothers\u2019 garden. Their grandma was in the kitchen. I could hear her singing as she washed dishes while we all hung out beneath the shade of the trees. We weren\u2019t speaking much. Just mostly hanging out until Kai showed up with the sword.\n\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Bailey was the first to react, sitting upright with eyes the size of dinner plates, \u201cIs that real?\u201d\n\nIt sure looked real. It had an edge that glinted.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Kai replied smugly. He stopped at the edge of the courtyard and held it up so we could all see, even from the distance.\n\n\u201cYou went BACK?\u201d Tonya demanded, \u201cOn your own?!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like the Aunts.\u201d Kai scoffed, lowering the sword slightly. He didn\u2019t deny it. A fact that made me deeply, deeply uneasy.\n\n\u201cDid you see her?\u201d Badr asked. His voice barely carried across the garden. Kai kind of shrugged, idly swinging the sword back and forth in the air. He looked at the clouds for a little bit before letting the sword down so that the tip dug into the earth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going back tonight. You guys want to come?\u201d I watched the little furrow the blade drew in the dirt, speechless. Edi spoke my thoughts. She was there at the house, but she\u2019d steadfastly refused to return to the complex with us since Olivia stopped going.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d It was just\u2026 so many whys. Why would he WANT to go back to that place at all, much less at NIGHT? It wasn\u2019t like the other buildings, which seemed to have a weird cushion of disbelief. This one felt real and vivid and horrifying, and none of those sensations had faded at all while I was sick.\n\n\u201cBecause you can see the stars better at night.\u201d Kai\u2019s brow wrinkled in a way that suggested he thought it was obvious- and that we were stupid for having to ask.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d I didn\u2019t stop to think about my answer. For once I couldn\u2019t have cared less what the others thought. Fuck that. Fuck everything about that. I wasn\u2019t touching that place with a ten foot pole- especially at night!\n\nA chorus of nos echoed mine. Not a single person wanted any of that.\n\nKai\u2019s face crumpled into a fierce scowl.\n\n\u201cFine, to hell with you guys.\u201d He snarled. I\u2019d seen rabid animals with friendlier expressions, and recoiled instinctively. Some part of me wondered at the time when Kai had the time to go back. Hadn\u2019t he gotten sick like the rest of us?\n\nHe stalked off before I could ask, and in the uneasy quiet that followed Mischa looked at Tonya.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really going to do it.\u201d He said. I nodded dumbly even though he wasn\u2019t speaking to me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try and talk him out of it.\u201d Tonya got up and headed toward the gate.\n\nI did maybe the smartest thing I\u2019ve ever done. After Mischa left to follow her I got up and hopped on my bike. I cycled all the way to Kai\u2019s house and told his parents everything. Mostly everything, anyway. I left out the supernatural bits, because I wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d believe me and because the story was frightening enough without them.\n\nIt was a cardinal sin, tattling to someone\u2019s parents, but it felt like small potatoes in comparison.\n\nKai\u2019s dad grabbed a handful of his uncles and asked me to show them the apartment. I pedaled up that way with a contingent of adults behind me, led them to the hole in the fence and then up to the gates of what I have come to consider hell.\n\nWe passed three bikes on the way in. And found Mischa and Tonya at the entrance.\n\nNo Kai, though. We were sent home while the adults swept the apartments- all of them. They never found Kai, though. A few days passed. And then some weeks. Posters went up around town, begging anyone who had any information to speak to the authorities. But then a particularly bad strain of the flu went around and distracted most of the town, and slowly Kai became more of an afterthought. And then a memory.\n\nAnd then not even that.\n\nWe were all kept home for several months after. My own mother refused to let me out of her sight.\n\n\u201cI wish Mischa had just moved on.\u201d Bailey sighed, calling me back to the present once more. I couldn\u2019t help but agree. What had happened to Mischa and Tonya put an end to our days at the abandoned apartment complex for good.\n\nTheir parents burned the complex down. I don\u2019t know for *sure,* but I think most people \u2018knew\u2019. They finished what some long-ago person had startled, and eventually the forest took the land back. You can barely tell it was ever there, now. I\u2019ve checked it out on google maps and it\u2019s barely more than a crooked fence and a few peek-a-boo glimpses of blackened pavement.\n\nBut it still feels like it's watching me back.","26":"We\u2019re called wayfarers.\n\nDon't think you can crack open a random dictionary, point your finger at the definition, and viola, that's us (it\u2019s only in our families \u2018cause I scribbled it in), but it\u2019s what people like us call ourselves. People who drive four, eight, *ten* hours a day and pull over to rest stops every other night. In a way we\u2019re like truckers, always on the road, eating pseudo-dinners, going from one place to another\u2026 only that most truckers aren't personally responsible for saving multiple major U.S. cities from complete and total destruction and genocide.\n\n*Technically*, it's Dad who does the city saving bit, since I\u2019m not a real wayfarer yet, as he loves to remind me. Oh, and mom helps out too, as she loves to remind *him*. And then usually they start kissing, and giggling, and\u2015 ugh, why'd I start talking about this again?\n\n*Right*, wayfarers.\n\nI'll explain a different way. So there's this dude, Plato (pretty dope philosopher) who explains that life's like a bunch of people chained up in a cave staring at shadows on a wall. How these people have survived into adulthood without food or water or the natural exercise a body needs to live, I've got no idea, but there they are, chained up, and their entire life is just these shadows they see dancing in front of them. \u2018And this is it right, guys?\u2019 they probably ask each other. \u2018This is all there is? Just a bunch of dancing shadow unicorns and goofy shadow muppets, and nothing more, yeah? Right?\u2019\n\nBig fat WRONG. Cause there is more, a *lot* more, trees and bushes, playgrounds and drinking fountains, swings, and grass, and running children, and\u2015 okay I now realize, these are all just things in the kid\u2019s park we\u2019re parked at... but these cave dudes still have no idea!\n\nAnd neither do those kids, assuming they live in normal houses and everything. There\u2019s this whole world on the road they don\u2019t know about, where gas stations are crammed full of secret clues. And the people that stop to help you because you\u2019ve busted a tire aren't always just nice harmless idaho-ian farmers. And where any city could be swallowed into the aether at any second if somebody doesn\u2019t get there first to stop it.\n\nThose kids don\u2019t realize they\u2019re staring at wall-shadows. They have absolutely no idea at all that it\u2019s a two-dimensional, fake, manufactured life.\n\nAnd hopefully, they never will.\n\nSee, there\u2019s a city on the I-15 just between Las Vegas and the California border called *San Infiel.* It\u2019s got a population of half a million, and it used to be the biggest city in Nevada, the most famous place in the world for gambling, drinking, drug use, prostitution\u2015 basically all the stuff Mom says she\u2019ll strangle me if I ever try. There it is, this giant of a city, plopped in the middle of a desert, raking in millions of dollars by the day\u2026 but you won\u2019t find it on a map.\n\nYou can look, go ahead, but the only city you\u2019ll find is this dinky shabby place named Jean (no offense\u2026 well kinda) with a population of precisely zero people, right on top of where San Infiel should be. It won\u2019t be on Google. You won\u2019t find the name in a magazine. As much as you search, you\u2019ll never find a whisper of the city San Infiel written down anywhere.\n\nBut it\u2019s there. Right where Jean is. A whole city sucked out of the earth\u2019s consciousness and forgotten. And the people? They're still there, trapped forever in a living hell, unable to escape and nonexistent to everyone\u2015 *almost* everyone.\n\nLet\u2019s just say, my family hasn\u2019t gone on vacation to Jean for a reason.\n\nIt was about forty years ago when it happened\u2015 Dad was only five so he doesn\u2019t remember much\u2015 but there was a tear in the Aether. A BIG one. Usually cities like San Infiel have permanent wayfarers posted there to fix up all the crap that happens wherever there's a lot of people living together, but the self-entitled bozo stationed there at the time was apparently *too* important to lift a pinky to help out (or super dead. One of the two). Other wayfarers tried to come once they\u2019d heard, but with a city like that in the middle of nowhere, nobody was close enough. This tear kept growing, and growing, and growing\u2015\n\nAnd then San Infiel was gone.\n\nJust gone.\n\nSo that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. Wayfarers. Dad\u2019s the only one in our family with a wayfarer license, but I\u2019ll do anything for the road to give me one too. We\u2019re dying out faster than new ones are being chosen, but I can help. I *know* I can help. The road just has to see I\u2019m ready.\n\nBecause if it doesn't, soon there will be nobody else to drive from city to city. Nobody else to make sure that ninety-nine percent of the human population stays locked up in their caves, watching their little shadow puppets, living happy ignorant lives...\n\nAnd nobody else to pray for their sakes that they never get to find out otherwise.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt\u2019s a day late in April, on the way to seal up a tear in Atlanta, when I decide my parents need a reminder of their chief responsibility in life: Me. More specifically\\*,\\* ensuring that I\u2019m well-tutored to drive the car in two months when I turn sixteen.\n\nI\u2019m helpful like that.\n\n**ME:** Pull over.\n\n**DAD**: Pull over?\n\n**ME**: Fine. Pull over, *please.* Happy?\n\n**DAD:** No, I mean, why should I pull over?\n\n**ME:** Father, I\u2019m a blossoming teenager with the inability to focus on more than a single thing at a time. For the past four months there\u2019s only one reason I\u2019ve ever told you to pull off the road, so do you actually need me to answer that question, or do you already know the response?\n\n**DAD:** Answer the question.\n\n**ME:** Can I drive?\n\n**DAD:** Nope.\n\n**ME:** Ugh\u2015 And you dear mother?\n\n**MOM:** Why do you assume I\u2019d have a different response than your father?\n\n**ME:** Because it\u2019s an unfair reponse. How am I supposed to become a wayfarer if I can\u2019t even drive. You both keep saying you\u2019ll let me practice, and you keep *not* letting me practice. That\u2019s lying. Pretty sure it\u2019s illegal to lie to kids.\n\n**DAD:** Sure it\u2019s not. Your mom and I tell you we love you every night, don\u2019t we?\n\n**MOM:** Not the time Hue.\n\n**ME:** Yeah dad, not the time.\n\n**MOM:** *Reed*.\n\n**ME:** What! I was just agreeing with you, *gosh\u2026* So can I drive?\n\n**DAD:** Nope.\n\n**ME**: Ugh\u2015 Why?\n\n**DAD:** Maybe it has something to do with the pack of slits half an hour behind us. Just a thought.\n\nOk *fine*. A group of killer winged creatures has been on our tail most of the day, but they\u2019re still like a good fifteen miles away, so not a valid excuse. I take another breath to point this obvious fact out to dad, but I\u2019m cut off.\n\n**SIERRA:** Can you shut up already Reed? I haven't driven for a week, and I\u2019m not complaining, so just shut up.\n\n**MOM:** Don\u2019t tell Reed to shut up.\n\n**SIERRA**: Okay, will the person who happens to be torturing my eardrums with his dweeby voice, kindly shut up?\n\nThat\u2019s my sister by the way. Sierra. If anything a level 3 coolness at most. She desires nothing more in life than to be the stereotype of an annoying older sister, and I\u2019m proud to say she\u2019s achieved this worthy goal for the last seventeen years with the dedication of an olympic gold-medalist.\n\nI let out a dramatic sigh. She hates it when I sigh.\n\n**ME:** We geniuses have always been persecuted.\n\n**SIERRA:** You geniuses? Didn\u2019t mom give you a C on your essay last week?\n\n**ME:** *\u2018True knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing.\u2019* Socrates.\n\n**SIERRA:** At least we agree that you know noth\u2015\n\n**MOM:** SHHH!\n\n**SIERRA:** But mom he\u2015\n\nMom points in the distance and both Sierra and I get it. And yes, we shut up. Because poking out from the barrier of pine trees on either side of us, exactly parallel to the road is the tall metal structure of a gas station. And not just any. Painted across the metal sunroof shading the gas pumps are the words ***Checkpoint 78.***\n\n*A wayside.*\n\nFor the most part, gas stations and waysides look pretty similar, similar enough that normal people could never tell the difference unless they\u2019d been in one before (not that they\u2019d ever get the chance). They\u2019ve both got outdated parking lots. They\u2019ve both got working air pumps. They\u2019ve both got rows of overpriced, under-stocked travel snacks in the building. But we\u2019d never consider stopping at a regular gas station with a pack of slits on our tail.\n\nFor a wayside? Heck yes.\n\nSure enough, mom and dad look at each other, and dad slows our van as we pass by the Checkpoint 78, not stopping, but not exactly going either. The parking lot\u2019s deserted, as it should be.\n\n**MOM:** We\u2019ll find another one if we keep going.\n\n**DAD:** This is the first one this week. It could help with the tear when we get to Atlanta.\n\n**MOM:** Hue, the kids are with us, and we\u2019re not even sure how far back the pack is. The road was curving. They could have cut through the forest.\n\n**DAD:** It was curving both ways. And even if they reach us they can\u2019t enter the wayside, you know that.\n\n**MOM:** They can surround us.\n\n**DAD:** You\u2019re right. It\u2019s true and you are so, so right. It\u2019s not safe, and it\u2019s not smart\u2026 but Marriane, if there\u2019s a map in there to a safe road, we wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the slits for the rest of today. It\u2019d be more secure in the long run.\n\nMom bites her lip, all nervous, and glances back at the four of us. I can already tell what she\u2019s thinking: *No. No. NO. Not with my kids in the car. Not when it puts them in danger. Not now. Not something this unsafe.*\n\nI\u2019m about to cut in and try to convince her to dad\u2019s side (an adrenaline spike sounds great after this long in the car), but dad grabs her hand first and squeezes it.\n\n**DAD:** Ten minutes. That\u2019s all.\n\nHer face grows whiter and whiter, but she nods. *YES.* I flip a thumbs up to Peter, but his face is plenty pale too. Wuss.\n\nAnd then dad turns into the wayside parking lot, away from the tear we\u2019re on the way to seal up, with a pack of murderous slits somewhere between half an hour and five minutes from reaching us.\n\nI hope they have cherry flavored slushies.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe second we\u2019ve screeched to a halt beside the gas pump, mom splits us up into \u2018*teams\u2019*, because apparently we\u2019re back in preschool now? My little sister, Hazel, demands to go with Sierra (mom caves in possible-death situations to save time), so I\u2019m with Peter. I\u2019m not surprised at all when he volunteers to go scavenging inside the wayside for clues; this way he\u2019ll get a chance to see Roxanne\\*.\\*\n\nThat\u2019s what *he* calls her at least.\n\nAs far as I can tell, she\u2019s never had a name, never will have a name, and quite frankly, doesn\u2019t give a crap about having a name, but trying to change Peter\u2019s mind would only ever cost me a few extra minutes I could be rummaging through the souvenir aisle.\n\nSo he calls her Roxanne.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was five or six that I really started to notice her. It didn\u2019t matter where we went or how far we traveled but at every wayside, she was always the one behind the cash register, chewing the same wad of sickly-pink gum with the same apathetic, expression of a post-college aged girl who\u2019d just didn\u2019t have the drive for college. She never gets older. Never changes. And never remembers us.\n\nThere\u2019s very few debate topics I strive to avoid in our household ( or *carhold*  I suppose), but whether or not Roxanne is actually alive, is about the all time tabuu. Peter\u2019s as anxious as fourteen year olds go, but when it comes to her, he's more stubborn than a semi truck. Just *figures* that the only girl that doesn\u2019t give Peter panic attacks happens to be a fabricated, non-sentient construct of the road\u2026 Not that I\u2019d ever *bully* him about it.\n\nOnly joking. Of course I do.\n\nSo as I make my way to the gum rack, Peter makes his way to lean against the front counter. \u201cRoxanne!\u201d he says. \u201cI missed you! You\u2019ve really kept this place shining.\u201d\n\nRoxanne looks up from counting money and wrinkles her nose. \u201cYou trynna to buy somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, uh, no. Just wanted to see how you\u2019re doing? Is there anything I can help you with?\u201d\n\nI throw up a bit in my mouth but keep rifling through the gum stacks.It\u2019s important for at least one of us to work, and not to brag (actually, totally to brag), but I\u2019m the best in our family at clue finding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she says flatly.\n\n\u201cOh\u2015 oh, good. If you\u2019re not too busy, could I ask you on a walk? I can show you the spark plug I fixed all by my lonesome. Pretty impressive, huh?\u201d\n\nRoxanne sighs. Then she sets an OUT FOR LUNCH plaque on the counter and chomps her gum all the way back to her break room. That\u2019s a new one.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d Peter shouts after her, \u201cGimme a *chance* one of these times, would you!\u201d\n\n\u201cGuess she\u2019s just not into *lonesome* cowboys like yourself,\u201d I say. I only have a second to duck before Peter chucks the service bell right over my head. *Good ol\u2019Petey.*\n\nWhile Sierra and Hazel check for fliers on the outside of the wayside, and mom and dad attempt to wash the fine layer of splattered bugs from our windshield, Peter and I go through as many shelves as we can. We look for anything out of the ordinary\u2015bubblegum that\u2019s two thousand calories a serving instead of fifty, fridge magnets that refuse to stick, off-brand Beanie Babies that weigh double the normal. Anything and everything that might give us a hint or be useful later.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing this for years, but it\u2019s still my favorite part of wayfaring. Since I was little, I\u2019ve even kept lists of the most common manifestations of wayside clues. Maybe the label of a cough syrup bottle will spell out directions to a shortcut to the other side of the country. Or maybe a bag of trail mix with Skittles instead of M&Ms will help warn us if we get close to any mimics. There\u2019s an art to finding clues in a wayside, the skill of noticing even the slightest variation that I've worked hard to perfect, the ability to distinguish between a COCA COLA  and a *COLA* COLA\\*\u2026\\* an art we don\u2019t have time for.\n\nEven if slits can\u2019t actually enter wayside parking lots, mom is technically right. They can still surround us. Driving out would still be a nightmare, albeit a fun one. So I shove as many odd-looking beaded keychains into my pockets as will fit, and instruct Peter to fill his backpack with packs of misshapen baseball cards. We don\u2019t even bother rifling through the tray of Alabama state maps, just grab the whole pile to examine with the rest of our loot back in the car. Special wayside maps are worth literal gold if you can find one, and my hands are already itching to unfold these ones.\n\n\u201cReed look,\u201d Peter says and holds up a **FutterBinger** bar\u2015 misspelling is the surest sign in food. He lobs it at my head before I can react this time and grins.\n\nI grin back. And nail him with a Milky Way. Which of course leads him to throw something at me, and me something at him, and\u2015 *well*, what follows can only be described in the term of \u2018all out war.\u2019 Handfuls of poptarts lobbed in every direction. Shelves of chips overturned. Roxanne is apparently too busy to notice the complete destruction of her business, and we\u2019re laughing too hard to hear the front door swing open.\n\n\u201cI leave you alone for five minutes, and you destroy half the gas station,\u201d Mom sighs. We freeze as the door swings shut behind her.\n\n\u201cUncontrolled energy.\u201d I widen my eyes as innocently as they\u2019ll go. \u201cCome on mom. We\u2019re just a pair of young, developing\u2015\n\n\u201cLady-slaying,\u201d adds Peter.\n\n\u201c\u2015lady-slaying adolescents. Biologically speaking, our brains aren't even wholly formed yet. *We* aren't responsible for what our hormones make us do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd to think your father almost talked me into letting your hormone-driven mind drive the car. A pity.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Ah*, well, you see...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever you found is good enough,\u201d she interrupts, and all at once, the tension in her body comes back. \u201cWe\u2019ve already stayed too long. Dad wants your help with repacking the bag, Reed.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m smart enough to know when I shouldn\u2019t resist her, but Mom isn\u2019t actually mad at us; we haven't destroyed anything, not really. As soon as we\u2019re back on the road and turn the corner, the Checkpoint 78 will disappear from existence like waysides always do. The next time we see Roxanne it\u2019ll be in a new gas station, still deserted and completely utterly clean.\n\nCan you really blame two teenage boy's for demolishing a building already scheduled for demolition?\n\nI\u2019ve already helped dad rearrange our travel suitcases, and I\u2019m just buckling Hazel into her carseat (the trick is to make faces so she doesn\u2019t resist) when Peter bursts out the gas station doors.\n\n\u201cDad!\u201d he calls, rushing over. \u201cDad something\u2019s wrong!\u201d\n\nThe four of us, dad, mom, Sierra, and I, snap to attention. Mom scans the surrounding pine trees.\n\n\u201cRoxanne,\u201d Peter says, panting, as he reaches us. \u201cShe\u2019s not inside. I looked everywhere and she\u2019s gone, just gone.\u201d\n\nWe let out a collective sigh of relief. Dad even tries to hold back a smirk. \u201cI\u2019m sure she went out for a nice day at the spa.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm serious dad. Something feels *wrong* in their.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe she found the lonesome cowboy of her dreams and they eloped,\u201d I offered.\n\n\u201cNot necessary Reed,\u201d Dad says and turns back to Peter. \u201cYou know, when your aunt Halli and I were kids, Roxanne didn\u2019t exist yet. Our cashier was an older man, *Fred,* we called him. Always told the same dumb joke about a talking pig, but one day we got to a wayside, and he wasn\u2019t there. No one was.\u201d Dad shrugs. \u201cNext time we found a station, it was Roxanne. Sometimes the road just switches them out.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody in the car,\u201d Mom says, and slides the door on Hazel and Sierra\u2019s side closed.\n\nPeter doesn\u2019t budge. Like I said, more stubborn than a semi. \u201cIt didn\u2019t switch her out,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw her when we got here. I think\u2015I just think we should find her first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go with him,\u201d I sigh.\n\n\u201cReed\u2015\u201d Dad starts.\n\n\u201cNo, for reals. His hands are literally shaking. If we don\u2019t find her, Peter\u2019s not gonna stop stressing until we find another wayside.\u201d Which is true, and Dad knows it. None of us feel good when Peter's having a panic attack. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it the once around, you pull up the car, we hop back in, and you speed off.\u201d\n\nHe hesitates, and I know I've won. It\u2019s a good argument, even if he doesn\u2019t want me to let me know it, so I whirl around and motion for Peter to join me. Dad\u2019s only response is the starting of our engine a few seconds later\n\n*See,* told you I was a good brother.\n\nThe second we push past the double sets of glass doors and scan the wayside, I know we're wasting our time.\n\nSnack isles: brimming with cancer-inducing food-like substances.\n\nWall posters: teaming with scantily clad women.\n\nCoffee maker: broken and groaning.\n\nExcept for a missing Roxanne, nothing\u2019s amiss in the slightest.\n\n\u201c*See*,\u201d Peter says.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably in the break room,\u201d I say. \u201cAs I recall, she spends fifty minutes of every hour on her\u2015what does she call it again?\u2015 *ten* minute break.\u201d\n\nPeter stomps past the front counter and shoves open *personnel-only* doors. The room\u2019s empty.\n\n\u201c*Okay*,\u201d I say, \u201cthen she\u2019s in the storage room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI checked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen she\u2019s in the bathroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not,\u201d he said again.\n\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s in\u2015 *w-w-wait*, did you go *into* the woman\u2019s bathroom?\u201d\n\nHe goes a bright crimson red but lifts his chin defiantly. \u201cI checked *everywhere* okay,  and she\u2019s gone. I\u2019m positive. Something\u2019s wrong with this gas station.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst logical fallacy\u2015it\u2019s *not* a gas station. Second\u2015 nothing\u2019s allowed to come inside a wayside, so nothing can be, quote, \u2018*wrong\u2019* with it.\u201d I put my arm around him and try to stifle a yawn. I really do want to help Peter avoid a panic attack, but sometimes I have to point out the obvious. \u201cLook, sorry dude, but they\u2019re waiting outside, and neither of us want to be stuck driving with an angry mom for the next few hours. We\u2019ll find Roxy at the next one.\u201d\n\nHe bites his lip, but shrugs in consent. *Good.* Personally, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Roxanne were hiding from Peter in the dumpster until we left, but I keep my lips sealed as we trudge out the\u2015\n\n*CRrAaaSHHhh.*\n\nWe both freeze.\n\n\"Okay you're right,\" he whispers, eyes wide. \"We should go.\"\n\nThe clatter came from behind us. Muffled. To the right. The storage room is off to the left which means the only door it could have come from is\u2026 \u201cThe Beer Cave,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cNo really,\u201d Peter says again, his voice a pitch higher. \u201c I\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine. Dad\u2019s waiting.\u201d\n\nI creep forward, careful to step over Peter and my\u2019s minefield of crinkly chip bags from earlier. He mutters a few more begged warnings but stays just a step behind me, all the same. No way in frick am I leaving now.\n\nWhen we reach the clear glass barrier between us and the cooler room, I peer inside. Jagged glass shards litter the floor, the remnants of 2 A.M. desperation-beer bottles, and puddles of varying browns ooze and merge together. One of the spills still seeps along the cracks between tiles and drips from the larger pieces of bottle\u2015 *the culprit*, I think.\n\nBut no. It might have *made* the noise, but bottle things don\u2019t fall without a reason. And nobody in my family came in here.\n\nI ease the handle towards me and the plastic suction of the insulating rubber slurps apart. \"Did you check in here?\" I ask.\n\n\"She hates the cold,\" Peter says.\n\nI swing the door open fully, and a wave of coolness wafts over me, an escaped breath of arctic wind. Stacked boxes of cans wait in disorderly rows. Utop those sit loose bottles, each capped with golden, scrunched-up aluminum. The cave is deserted, but an odd shiver that has nothing to do with refrigerated air creeps up my spine.\n\n*Which is ridiculous,* I remind myself.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing in here. No rabid kittens waiting to meow us to death. No Roxanne. Not even a box of popsicles to grab for Hazel. Peter\u2019s already checked the gas station, and Dad\u2019s waiting in a stalling van outside, so what\u2019s the point of being in here?\n\nAs if in agreement, the air vent gives a pointed coughing sputter.\n\n\u201cThis, Peter, is what you call an anticlimactic.\u201d I spin on my heels to leave this utterly *pointless* waste of my ever-degrading human existence\u2015\n\nBut Peter doesn\u2019t move.\n\nHe stands rigid. Open-mouthed. Not breathing. His eyes stare unblinking upwards, and I follow his line of vision.\n\nWell, crap.\n\nThere, on the refrigerator ceiling, covering it so completely you\u2019d think it was simply painted black, is *it*. The thing\u2019s eyes are closed in sleep. It\u2019s enormous wing bones stab into the front and back walls, suspending it in midair. The zipper mouth is parted slightly to show rows and rows of chainsaw-like teeth, but it\u2019s breath exhales on time to the steady whirring of the cooling fans.\n\nA slit.\n\nAnd based on the distinctly human-shaped bulge in it\u2019s underbelly, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve solved the case of the missing Roxanne.\n\nI won\u2019t tell Peter if you don\u2019t.\n\n[MORE](https:\/\/www.wattpad.com\/myworks\/291144088\/write\/1152788175)","27":"This is a long one guys, sorry! Feel free to skip through\u2026\n\nMy dad, being Irish and wanting to live somewhere close to his childhood home, bought a house in a remote part of Northern Ireland in 2007. It\u2019s a pretty old farmhouse (18th century I think?), and back then was completely dilapidated. I\u2019ll never forget the first time he showed it to my brother and I, he had spent the long car journey hyping it up, telling us about how incredible the location was, how spacious it was, the amazing interior. And then we arrived at what was essentially, a creepy, old building site (the \u2018creepy\u2019 vibe not helped by the torrential rain that was being released by the heavens that day). Still, over the years, post renovation, I\u2019ve grown to love spending time there. There\u2019s beautiful, green rolling hills surrounding the property, there\u2019s a sea view and the beach is a stone\u2019s throw away, with nobody around for miles. It\u2019s a hermit\u2019s paradise. \n\nI have always, however, felt unnerved and creeped out by it. During the first holiday I ever spent there (I was around nine years old I think), we were clearing out the attic and found an old photograph of a young woman, probably from around the Victorian times. My younger brother was absolutely terrified of it, I used to prank him by putting it in his bed before he went to sleep, or by rapping my knuckles against the bed frame pretending that \u201cBertha\u201d (as we nicknamed her) the ghost lady was coming from him\u2026.It was, granted, an unnerving photograph. There was a wild, vacant look in her eyes, and she was ghostly pale in complexion. A local from the neighbouring glen who knew about the history of the house mentioned that there was a rumour that a young woman had been murdered by her jealous husband in the late 1850\u2019s in a house in the Lower glen, so could have been our house (but also could have been one of the other old houses in the area). That rumour though, was enough to eventually make us return the picture to the attic, never to be retrieved again, even for pranks. \n\nAt night the house went from being creepy to being deeply unsettling. Bangs, footsteps, tappings, knocks sounded at all hours. My dad blamed the plumbing, the old pipes and our imaginations, and that was what we would tell ourselves too. Except that it would happen while the pipes were cold and when there was nobody else around. I remember one morning my dad and I drove to our nearest village to pick up coffee and the newspaper. Half an hour later we were back, to the immense relief of my brother who was visibly shaking as he let us in. Apparently the second he was alone and watching TV, he heard the distinct sound of heavy footsteps walking on the floor above him. Every time he paused the TV it stopped, and when he resumed it, they resumed. He vowed never to be left alone again, and basically stopped coming to the house after that. \n\nIn more recent years I\u2019ve been spending a lot more time at the house, being a lover of solitude and nature. I can\u2019t go alone (for reasons stated above!) so go with my partner, who finds it equally spooky. We both hear the unexplained sounds, the tapping and knocking at the windows, the footsteps at night. My partner is somewhat \u2018sensitive\u2019 and has had paranormal encounters before. She said that the minute she stepped into the house she could feel a sinister, dark energy emanating from inside. I got into the habit while we were staying there of going out on long walks, in an attempt to prevent cabin fever. Whenever I returned, she would always report something eerie that had occurred while I was out. For example, once she had been hoovering the living room and had felt two hands grab her by the waist, only to spin around and find nothing\/nobody there. She felt taps on her shoulder, heard my voice calling out her name when I wasn\u2019t at home, and heard the sounds of people moving around the house while she was in the shower. \n\n\nThen, recently, things got even scarier. We decided go visit the house on a Halloween mini-break, and the second we arrived we both felt this hostile energy, as if we were trespassing in somebody else\u2019s house. It is worth noting that, shortly after my dad bought the house all those years ago, he ended up having to work full time in London so was unable to permanently live there. There was talk of renting it out but nothing came of it, so the house just sits there, desolate, empty for most months of the year. But, perhaps it does have a full-time resident after all\u2026..\n\n\nAnyway, we decided to try and shake of the feelings of unease and celebrate Halloween. We did the usual thing, got drunk on cheap wine, put scary makeup and costumes on and watched stupid horror movies all evening. At around 11pm, my partner went to go and get another bottle of wine from the fridge while I stayed in the living room. I suddenly heard her saying \u201cOh my god\u201d and I immediately stood up and rushed over to her. She turned to me, looking frightened, and said that she\u2019d seen a white, swirling mist outside in the garden, against the pitch black darkness. It had vanished after a few seconds. That night, the noises and footsteps were louder than ever\u2026.\n\n\nA few days later, I was at the house by myself. My partner had gone away to see her family who lived a few hours away, and would be returning later on that evening I was sitting at the desk working downstairs in the living room, trying to ignore the growing uneasiness I was feeling. Then, I started to hear, same as usual, footsteps sounding upstairs. But this time it was different, it was louder, as if a flurry of people were trampling around upstairs. I could hear the sound of bedsheets being moved, furniture being moved. It was coming from the upstairs room at the end of the house, where most of the unexplained noise originates from. The way I described it to those I related it to was that it sounded as if a few people were making preparations upstairs for a visitor. Except I was all alone\u2026.I was petrified and immediately phoned my partner, telling her what was happening. It was so loud that she could hear it over FaceTime. \n\n\n\n\nMY MOST RECENT EXPERIENCE (seeing the ghost!)\n\n\n\n\nSo, now for the most recent, and in my mind, most terrifying happening in the house so far\u2026. This happened less than a week ago, in the early hours of Monday morning. My partner and I had flown over for a weekend autumn break and had been due to fly home that morning. However, she suffers badly with endometriosis and had a flare up, which meant that we ended up delaying our flight. \n\nAnyway, it was about 5:30am and we were both in bed. She was asleep, exhausted from feeling unwell, but I was wide awake and listening to upbeat music, just praying for tiredness. Suddenly, without warning, I became overcome with this intense, consuming feeling of dread. I went from feeling good to feeling completely freaked out in the space of about ten seconds. I took my earphones out  and turned the music off. From my position, I could see the door and most of the room aside from the side of the bed, my partner was sleeping nearest the door, I was on the other side. The room was dark, but some morning light was starting to filter into the cracks between the blinds, with the shapes of the furniture in the room being visible. I could see the cracks of light underneath the door being reflected onto the wall opposite, as we\u2019d left the lights on. And then, I saw something -a shadow moving back and forth underneath the door. I started to feel even more afraid. Then, I heard a very loud footstep just outside the door, where the shadow was coming from, and the heavy creak of floorboards. \n\n\nI was at this point completely paralysed with fear. Then, and I still can\u2019t believe this happened as I type it out now, I saw a dark grey figure glide from the door across the room. It was hooded, almost Grim Reaper-esque, and I distinctly remember observing its transparency as it floated in front of the big wardrobe  and around the bed to where I was lying. It was at this point that it went out of my line of vision, and, being unable to physically move, I didn\u2019t turn to see where it went. I summoned up the courage to use my right hand to shake my partner awake. She, after a good few minutes, woke up and turned the light on, becoming concerned when she saw the state I was in. Apparently I was totally pale, and shaking and unable to speak until she had managed to calm me down. I\u2019m still recovering now, it was the most visceral, horrifying thing I\u2019d ever witnessed. I think what made it so scary was the fact that I got a very sinister energy from whatever this thing was. We are now back at home, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be back to the house for a long time\u2026\u2026\n\n\nThank you so much for reading and let me know your thoughts in the comments, I\u2019d be really interested to hear your theories as to what might be happening here :)","28":"I've never considered myself easily scared, in fact I'd say I've always seen myself as someone rather brave. My pride might be a bit too big, annoying to some, but I don't mind, with it being me and all. But I have to admit, and this with great difficulty, that I might not be nearly as brave as I tend to claim.\nThis... Incident happened about a month ago. It's not before now I dare speak about it, being too self conscious to share it.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon, probably around midnight when it happened. I had just ended a call with my friend of ten years, having talked about a show recently released on Netflix. We'd both been immediately caught, and upon realizing the other liked it as much as we ourselves did, the whole afternoon till midnight had consisted of us discussing every detail, opinion and theory about the show. When we finally agreed to hang up my small, rented apartment laid in complete and utter darkness.\n\nI'm not scared of darkness, of course I'm not. I put aside my laptop on the couch beside me, stood up and froze. I can't explain what happened, at least not fully, because I'm not even sure about it myself. Few feet away, right where the light switch is, my eye caught just the slightest of movement. I thought that it was strange, with me being alone in the apartment, and not owning any animals of any sort. Slowly, I lowered my head, narrowed my eyes and there it was again. Just the slightest of movement but enough to catch my eye.\n\nMy breath caught in my throat. I'm not usually easy to scare, like I said earlier, but something about this just seemed off. I mean sure, it could've just been my eyes playing me a trick, I did just sit and stare at a bright screen for several hours in otherwise complete darkness, but the movement seemingly did not follow when I turned my eyes to test that theory.\nStanding completely still now, I reached into my hoodie pocket and grabbed for my phone where I remembered to have left it, but my hand only caught air and fabric. Annoyed, and honestly starting to get freaked out, I pulled my pocket inside out, finding nothing in the dark. I then did the same with both the pockets in my newly bought denim jeans. Once again no phone.\n\nCursing under my breath I lowered my body enough to drop my hand onto my couch, not moving my eyes from the dark.\nI ran my hand along the soft, grey fabric, finding nothing but a single, crumbled sock. I was just about to turn my head when the movement was there again, this time for longer, more visible than before.\nMy eyes widened and now my heart raced in my chest, like was it a horse galloping along the cavity of my ribs, trying to break free.\n\nSomething cold touched my finger, and though I'm hesitant to admit it, I must've yelped in shock, pulling my hand to my chest like had it been electrocuted. Immediately my head turned to see what had touched my finger, fearing for the worst, already seeing two white eyes for me and a big toothy grin, but as my eyes landed on the couch where my hand had been, all I saw was my phone, pressed halfway down into the crook between the cushions.\nA shaky, uncertain laugh escaped my lips as I picked it up and turned it on, seeing that it still had little battery left, enough for the flashlight to work for a while.\n\nI unlocked my phone, typing in my password consisting of a lot of random numbers and letters, pulled down the menu and clicked the small round button with the picture of a flashlight on it. Immediately the couch was bathed in light, burning my eyes, forcing me to look away. Sun's danced for my eyes for several minutes, and I impatiently waited for them to fade as I slowly stood back up and turned in the direction of the light switch.\nThe flashlight shone on my hardwood floor, sweeped over a drawer where I keep my games and game consoles, illuminated a bookshelf in the corner filled with my many books, and finally, reached the light switch...\n\nNothing.\nNothing was there, just the switch, waiting patiently for me to flick it. I hesitated, feeling stupid though cautious. And with small steps I headed around my coffee table, towards the opposite wall, towards the switch.\nAnd then it happened again.\nA movement, quick, testing, right off to my side, right beside the couch. I heard the fans whirl, the so well known sound, the sound of my computer turning on. \nA bright burst of light shone from the open computer, and as it turned on, I swear on my life that I saw what looked like a hooded figure dressed all in black, and a wide, gleeful grin before I turned and ran the hell out of there.\n\nI've been staying at my friends house since, not daring going back home fearing that whoever that person was, standing in my darkened apartment, will come back and finish whatever he had come for. My friend has offered to go to my apartment, even to stay there with me for as long as I need for me to settle from my shock, but there's no way in hell I'm going back, at least not yet.\nAt least not before my apartment has been thoroughly searched in broad daylight, the locks changed and more lights added so that I will never again be caught in the pulling arms of darkness and the fears that lurks in it.....","29":" I had my first episode of night terrors about a month ago, it lasted just a few minutes, I heard a soft scraping from my left but couldn\u2019t identify what had made the sound. It sounded like something hard was being dragged across the hardwood floors of my bedroom. The sound filled me with dread and try as I might, I couldn\u2019t turn my head to see the origin of the sound. Thought raced through my mind, what the hell made that sound? Why can\u2019t I move? What the hell is going on? WHY CAN'T I MOVE??? My heart was racing to the point that I could feel and see the blanket move on top of my chest. I could feel the sweat trickle down my face, I wanted so badly to reach up and wipe it from my brow, my fucking hands wont move!! My mind was in full panic mode, WHY CAN'T I MOVE?? The sound from my left grew closer my eyes began to tear up the liquid blurring my vision.\n\n I blinked several times to clear the tears from my vision. I saw a shadow retreat from my field of vision and all at once I was able to move. I shot up to a sitting position my head turning wildly form side to side. I quickly wiped the remnants of the tears from my eyes. Nothing, I saw absolutely nothing. I padded out to the kitchen in search of something to quench my thirst. I stood in front of the refrigerator reaching out to open the door my hand was trembling so badly that I could barely grip the handle. I pulled the door open and my eyes squinted in the harsh glow. I grabbed a water chugged it down.  I felt a bit better after that and walked back to the bedroom. Wow, that was some kind of nightmare I thought to myself as my head hit the pillow. Sleep came moments later.\n\u2003\n\nThe next day after I had finished up some work around the house, I did a little research on my nightmare. I found some interesting websites that catered to the paranormal, and I found some excellent articles on exactly what happened to me last night. Some of them had shades of the occult, others pointed to medical conditions. The occult ones were very interesting, full of demons and devils. Funny I thought, I am into this kind of stuff, I have tattoos featuring all kinds of skulls and a devil's head complete with pentagram. I just got a fresh new tattoo last month with a few sigils that my artist had found on some Pinterest boards. They looked wicked, so I had them forever imprinted onto my flesh.  I don\u2019t know what they were or what their origins were, but they looked cool. They were on my back and I could only see them by way of a mirror I tried in vain to take a few pictures of them and see if I could find out what they were, but none of them were in focus. I sent a text to my artist asking if he knew what they were, but he hasn\u2019t texted me back yet. I kept looking for about another hour or so before I was overwhelmed by all the possibilities of what ailed me. These were just nightmares, nothing to worry about I told myself. I was into the occult stuff, movies, books, video games and just about anything else. But these things aren\u2019t really real, right?\n\n A few nights after my first episode, it happened again, this time I saw a black mist like shape in the room. The sound was somehow more intense than the other day now that I could put a shape to the sound. I was still stricken with complete immobility. Since my last bout with this thing that invaded my nights, I took to leaving a night light on. The room was bathed in a soft amber glow just barely enough to see around in the room. I saw the shape in the corner of the room it was indistinct, more like shadows swirling around or something like a dark mist. The sound was coming from the same area that it had the other day, but as the sounds emanated from that corner, the apparition didn\u2019t move at all. I didn\u2019t understand what I was seeing, my mind, like the other day, was racing with rapid fire questions, what is that thing? Why is it here? What does it want with me? Why me? WHY CAN'T I MOVE? The only thing I could do was lay there helpless and wait for what would come next.  \n\nIt stayed there in the corner, not moving for what seemed like an eternity. I heard different sounds as well a soft murmuring coming from the inky mist, they were almost imperceptible. I could swear that I saw what looked like two barely glowing eyes approximately the same height that eyes would be on a tall person, at least 6 feet in height. The orbs were locked onto mine, unblinking and unwavering. They were the color of a smoldering charcoal briquet. My heart began to race the same way it did the other night, so hard I could hear it inside my head. The tears came again this time with more volume than last time and I just shut my eyes and wished for this to end. After a few moments I opened them again and the mist was gone. I was once again able to move. I sat up on my bed and reached out for the bedside lamp. I left it on for the rest of the night.\n\nI spent the next day doing more research on sleep paralysis, specifically medical ones. All the websites agreed on one thing, narcolepsy and sleep apnea were some of the more common causes. As far as I know I don\u2019t have either of these afflictions. Hypertension was another common cause. Again, I don\u2019t think that I have high blood pressure. I began to look into more of the supernatural causes. Some of the websites I visited were, shall we say, trash. A bunch of clickbait just to get you to buy crystals, incense, sage and all that other new age crap. I stumbled across a pretty interesting page. This looked like the real deal. While it didn\u2019t exactly go into the sleep paralysis phenomenon, it did explain in great detail the sigils that various demons and lesser devils used and their meanings. It went on to explain that some used these to summon that specific demon or entity. They even provided the commonly accepted pictures of about 30 or so of the most \"popular\" demons. As I was scrolling through the images, I stopped on one the one that represented Astaroth one of the great dukes of Hell. This image looked familiar to me, is this one of the sigils that Tommy, my tattoo artist, did on my back a month or so ago? \n\nI kept scrolling and stopped on another sigil this one represented Balam one of the kings of Hell. I am almost certain that this one is on my back as well. The last one that stopped my scrolling was the grand poo-bah of them all Lucifer. I know that this one is there right in the center top of the triangle that he did on my back. What the hell? I asked myself, did Tommy put three of the most powerful demons in hell sigils on my skin forever? I would have to ask him in person. I grabbed my car keys after printing the images out on my printer and left the house. I hoped that I was wrong.\n\nI arrived at the tattoo shop about 30 minutes later, walking in and asking for Tommy. He was working on a client and he waved me over to show off his progress on the lady's arm sleeve. Wow, he really did do great work, his craft was honed to near perfection. I asked him where he got the inspiration for the designs that he put on my back a few weeks ago, he explained to me that he found them on Pinterest and asked why. I told him about my sleep paralysis and the frightening thing that was in the corner of my room at night. He laughed at me telling me that those aren\u2019t demonic sigils that he did on my back. \n \"They were just some doodles from some guy on Pinterest no way are they legit.\" Tommy told me. \n\"I just thought that they looked pretty rad and would fit with the occult theme we have going on. They can't be real demonic sigils, no fucking way\" Tommy said while returning back to his work.\n\"Yeah, what are the odds that they are real?\" I laughed. I began to relax a bit.\n\"I'll see you in a couple weeks and we can continue on my back\" I said as I turned to leave.\n\nI had the pretty receptionist take a few good, clear, pictures of my back with my phone. I thanked her and made another appointment for two weeks from now to continue my back piece. I left the shop feeling a bit better, no way would Tommy knowingly put something on my back that would summon the devil. When I got to my car, I took out my phone and looked at the close up pictures that Shelia, the receptionist, had taken of my tattoo's. I held the printout up to my phone, and while they were very similar, they were not the same as what I had printed out, a squiggle here and a triangle there were in different places. The only one that matched was the Lucifer one. No big deal, the Devil himself has better things to do than fuck with me in the early morning hours. Right?\n\nThat night was the worst yet. I could see that the time was 3:15 in the morning in my peripheral vision, but that was the only thing that would move. I could see that black, inky figure fully formed now in the corner of my room. It stayed in the shadows as much as it could. When the light from the night light touched it, that part of its form vanished. It was like it turned invisible. I closed my eyes tight hoping that it would just be gone the next time I opened them. The next time I opened them the dark from was standing next to my bed looming over me. I could see that where the eyes would or should be there was indeed a smouldering flame like dancing in the empty sockets. WHY CAN'T I MOVE? \n\nMy heart was beating hard too hard and sweat began to trickle down my face. The demon\/thing reached out with one clawed finger and wiped some of my sweat from my face and brought its finger to its hideous misshapen mouth and licked the sweat from its finger. It smiled a shark toothed grin and vanished. It wasn\u2019t in a puff of smoke nor did it smell like brimstone as some of those websites claimed it would, it was just gone. I could move once again after it had gone back to where it had come from. I sat up, literally trembling all over my body. My clothes were soaked through in sweat and I found that it was hard to stand up as I placed my feet on the cool hardwood floor of my bedroom. I stood up shakily and walked into the bathroom and took a shower to wash the filth away from my body. I left all the lights on in my room the rest of the night.\n\nThe next morning, I made an appointment with my family doctor to see if there was something that could be done about these night terrors I was experiencing. I arrived for my appointment and sat waiting patiently for my name to be called. The nurse called my name and I proceeded into the small exam room, she made small talk with me as she took my temperature, pulse and blood pressure. All perfectly normal. Well strike that symptom off the list I thought to myself as the doctor came in. I then explained to him the details of the last couple of weeks. He nodded and wrote some chicken scratch down on his notepad. He then made me a referral to a shrink and wrote me a prescription for a mild sleeping pill that he assured me would make me \"sleep like a baby\" through the night and sent me on my way minus my 40 dollar co-pay. \n\nThanks for nothing doc I said to myself as I took the slip from his hand and got up to leave.  I made the appointment with the psychiatrist for the following week as she had no appointments available until then. What was she gonna do anyway? Give me more pills? Lock me away in a loony bin after I tell her my story? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t even go I told myself. I drove home feeling worse than I did before I made the appointment. Why was this happening to me I've all but eliminated any medical reasons, and least the physical ones, the mental ones have yet to be explored.  I'm not going crazy, at least I don't think I am, there has to be some kind of explanation for what is going on.\n\nWhen I got home there was note taped to my door. It was from my landlord. It stated that there was an odd smell coming from this floor and he just wanted to know if I knew where it could be coming from. I called his number and explained to him that I didn\u2019t smell anything odd. I asked him what the smell was he said that it smelled like sulfur or something similar, and that it seemed to be coming from my apartment. I invited him up to take a sniff test. He came up a few minutes later, I invited him inside and we took a tour all around my small two bedroom apartment. Neither one of us could find any scent other than the pleasant plug in that I had in just about every room which smelled like strawberries. Satisfied he apologized for the inconvenience and left my place shutting the door behind him. He told me that both the upstairs and downstairs neighbors called him with the complaints about the foul odor coming from the ventilation system.  \n\n  I sat down at my computer and dove into the internet looking for something to make this shit stop. I looked at my browser history and found that it had been wiped. What the hell? I had to start from scratch. I don\u2019t remember clearing it, maybe it was on some kind of schedule? I typed various keywords into the search engine all coming up with various hits, some sites were ok, and others, just like the other day were absolute trash. I did however find a site that I hadn\u2019t found before, this looked more promising than any others I had found yet. Much like that last one that had descriptions of the various sigils, this one went into way more details about the meaning and lore of each of the demons. I took my phone out and matched up the sigils that I had tattooed on me versus the sigil on this website. FUCK! All three were an exact match for each of the aforementioned three demons. HOLY FUCKING SHIT! What was I gonna do? I've been marked with three separate signs of the beast. As my fingers hovered over the keys, I could see that they were shaking like a leaf. Now what?\n\nThat night I didn\u2019t sleep in my bedroom. Instead I decided to pull a switcharoo on Old Scratch. If I wasn\u2019t in my bed, I couldn\u2019t sleep comfortably so in my mind that means I couldn\u2019t have an episode of sleep paralysis. Well, I was wrong. I was asleep in my recliner nearly sitting up as I opened my eyes the room was only lit by my laptop's screen the TV had shut itself off after a couple of hours of inactivity, damn you Netflix for asking me if I'm still watching. The dark figure was standing right in front of my chair. It took a step closer to me. It spread its long legs apart and I could see that it had an enormous appendage. Like a fucking summer sausage from Hillshire Farms. OH GOD PLEASE, DON\u2019T LET IT RAPE ME WITH THAT, I screamed inside my head. It straddled my chair and sat on my lap. It was face to face with me and it smiled that shark tooth grin. It opened its jaws and the black tongue slipped out licking the sweat from my face. It felt like a cat's tongue. Rough and abrasive. It slid across my face and sucked up all the sweat that was dripping from my eyebrows. The demon or whatever it was almost purred with pleasure.\n\n It brought a clawed finger up to my mouth and made a shushing motion to me. It placed its other hand on my chest feeling my wildly beating heart. It smiled again, apparently satisfied that it had properly terrified me. It then stood back up on its legs, if you could call them that. They looked like the hind legs of a goat or some such animal, complete with hooves instead of feet. Turned and took two long strides into the darkness if the corner and vanished. I was once again able to move even though I really didn\u2019t have the energy to. I was completely drained of all energy, I could barely muster the strength to pull myself out of the chair and hobble to the bathroom and vomit into the toilet. I didn\u2019t go back to sleep that night, maybe I never will.\n\nThe next day I drove straight to the tattoo shop bursting through the door in a rage. Tommy was sitting in his chair preparing to get underway on his current client. I grabbed him by his shirt and hauled him to his feet. \n\nI produced the images from the website I was on and showed him.\n\"What the FUCK did you put on me?\" I yelled into his face.\n\"Take it easy man, I told you the other day just some stuff from Pinterest.\" He said pulling free from my grasp.\n\"NO! this is something much worse, this is truly demonic, not your run of the mill dark spooky shit!\" I replied seething in anger.\n\"You said that it was ok, I don\u2019t know what to tell you man, I just did what you wanted.\" Tommy yelled back at me.\nI took a deep breath, counted to ten  and then I told him about the last few days and the escalating shit that was going on. \n\"it fucking licked my face last night. I'm not safe, I don\u2019t know what to do.\" I said as a tear rolled from my eye. \"Next time it will do something much fucking worse, I just know it.\" I continued.\n\n\"Go to a church and talk to a priest or something, maybe?\" Tommy said raising his hands up in frustration.\n\"Yeah, maybe so.\" I mumbled in agreement.\n\"We also do laser removal's here, but the image will still be visible even after you get it done.\" Shelia said from behind me. \"Maybe it would be enough to stop the demon or whatever it is.\" She added hopefully. \n\n\"If the image is still there, then I don\u2019t think that it would work, it has to be gone, like erased or cut out.\" I exclaimed out of frustration more than anger.\nI told Tommy that I was sorry about getting rough with him and he accepted my humble apology. We had been friends for years one little altercation wouldn\u2019t break that bond. I told him that I would keep him posted after I went to a church to talk to a priest.\n\nLater that afternoon, I pulled in front of an old gothic church and walked up the steps leading to the entrance. I pulled the huge door open and walked inside scanning for anyone that I thought could help me. I saw an older silver haired priest walking up to the pulpit and I made a b line for him. I stopped just short of where he was standing and cleared my throat getting his attention.\n\"What can I do for you, my son?\" The sliver priest inquired.\n\"I need your guidance, and please don\u2019t think I'm crazy when I tell you that I think a demon is stalking me.\" I implored. \n\nThe priest looked, his eyebrows arching, at me pointing to a bench for me to sit at and joined me. I told him my story, going as far as to show him the tattoos on my back and everything. He sat there listening intently asking questions when he thought it was needed and replying to my questions as best he could. He was a lot more understanding than I thought he would be, I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think that he wouldn\u2019t have. I felt spent by the time I finished my tale. We sat there in silence for a few moments and stood up reaching into his robes producing a golden crucifix.  Then reaching into one of his pockets he pulled out an ornate necklace with beads all around it. With some kind of charm hanging from the middle of it.\n\"take this crucifix and this rosary with you put this cross around your neck and leave it outside your clothes and hang this rosary from your headboard tonight.\" Father Evans, that was his name, instructed me. \"these weapons of God should help fight off the infernal beast.\" He added.\n\nI thanked him profusely and headed home as it was now getting later on in the day. I hoped to get a good night's sleep now that I was armed with weapons of holy power. I felt better than I had in days, I felt as if this nightmare could end without me getting sacrificed to some Arch Duke of Hell. Who knows, maybe it would actually work.\n\nThat night I slept in my bed again. I had propped myself up on pillows as to be a bit more upright. I fell asleep thinking that what that old priest had given me would scare off the Devil himself. You know the power of Christ compels you and all that shit. Well, I think I made it mad. Like \"Karen\" at a skateboarder mad. At promptly 3:15 my eyes popped wide open, I was immobilized, as usual, and the demon was sitting on my bed straddling my body. It playfully fiddled with the covers that I had pulled up to my chin. As it pulled the covers down revealing the crucifix, it recoiled in horror. It quickly slid back from my body and stood at the end of my bed. Making a hissing sound like an angry tomcat. What it did next made my blood run cold as ice. It spoke. Its voice was like if you put gravel in a blender on high. Deep and booming. \n\nIt pulled back its lips and hissed at the cross its eyes burning ever brighter.\n\"Do you think that that puny trinket will protect you, worm?\" It spat out the words.\n\"I am not afraid of your so-called savior, I wouldn\u2019t put any faith in your false prophet\" it roared.\n\"I will bring him to his knees and make him bow to my power\" it hissed.\nI felt my finger twitch, it hadn\u2019t done that before, I then realized that I could move. I grabbed the cross from its resting place on my chest and held it out before me like a shield. I reached out behind me and pulled the rosary from the hook it was on and flung it at the demon. It spun like a lasso and wrapped itself around its outstretched right arm. The demon howled in pain and ripped the rosary from its skin taking flesh with it. I could see that where the rosary had wrapped itself around the demon's arm, had left raw and openly bleeding wounds dripping a black blood like substance. It then locked onto my eyes hate burning in its eyes. If looks could kill, I would surely be dead on the spot. \n\n\"Is that all you have?\" the demon asked me mockingly baring its shark fangs at me.\n\"Why are you here, I never summoned or invoked you\" I yelled defiantly.  I was trying to be brave, my resolve growing as I held out the crucifix.\n\"You invited me by placing my sigil upon your body, I will be with you forever now. My torment will never end, you will never find peace, I promise you this.\" The demon replied triumphantly. \n\"Well then, I will never take this cross off and you won't be able to hurt me, now will you?\" I said in a mocking tone. I'm not sure if I pissed it off even further at that point, it just sounded like the right thing to say at that moment.\nThe demon vanished back into its realm and after it did, I could smell sulfur and rot. Jesus Christ, that was close. I better figure something out for when it comes back.\n\nThe next day I went to the church and told Father Evans about what had happened last night. \n\"You shouldn\u2019t have mocked it.\" He told me sternly. \"You have angered it to the point that it will seek revenge on you\" he then added. \"I fear for you and your soul if this beast isn\u2019t persuaded to leave you in peace.\" Father Evans said fearfully.\n\"I know, but it felt like the right thing to do at the time!\" I explained. \n\"Oh here, I think I hurt it with this\" I handed him the rosary that still had burned flesh clinging to it.\n\nThe priest took the corrupted rosary and slid it into his vest pocket. He said a short series of prayers over me and sent me on my way. \"Go with God\" he said as I stood to leave. I looked back at the old priest as I was leaving, he took out the rosary I gave him and was inspecting it. A look of disgust growing on his wrinkled face.  I turned back to him, asking him for his phone number just in case he thought of anything else that could help me.  We exchanged phone numbers and he promised to call me once he was able to speak with his superiors in Rome about what was going on.  I left the church in a good mood and ever hopeful that I could get this nightmare to end. \n\nThat night as I stepped out of the shower, and got dressed, getting ready for bed. I felt like a million bucks, better than I had in a few days. I put fresh sheets on the bed and laid down for a good night's sleep, my first since all this had started. At 3:15 my eyes opened involuntarily like they had every night the demon had visited me. I lay on my bed completely unable to move anything other than my eyes, the oily black figure slowly crawling onto my bed, saliva dripping from its misshapen mouth. As it got closer to my face, I could make out more horrific details about its face. The eyes were the worst of it, they were glowing like there was a fire behind them and they were filled with hate, hate for me and for all mankind. Its face was a mess of scars and burns and it was hard to distinguish between the two. \n\nIts skin was shiny, almost liquid like the way the soft light from my small nightlight danced across its slick skin. Its nose was a sharp hooked thing oozing some kind dark discharge dripping onto my blanket it seemed at the time to actually sizzle and burn the blanket as the drops fell onto the soft surface with soft pat, pat, pats. The foul breath reeked of rotten eggs. It's teeth, as it opened its maw, resembled a great white shark's mouth, triangular and slightly serrated at the tips. Its forked tongue flicked across the teeth slicing it as it played across the jagged edges. It leaked a black substance I could only guess was blood mixing with the saliva and ran freely from its horrible mouth. The raspy ragged breath came faster as it neared my face it seemed to smile and relish my fear. It took my face in one of its taloned hands and tilted my chin up so that I could see it better. The tongue flicked out and drug itself across my cheek my eyes went wide as I could feel the demon almost shiver with anticipation. \n\n\"Forget something, did we?\" it cooed into my ear. \"Where is your God now? You puny worm?\" it asked.  \nMy heart skipped a beat and a newfound sense of dread welled up inside me, I then realized,\nSHIT!! I took that cross off and left it on the bathroom basin. I forgot to put it back on!!!\n Its jaw unhinged like a snake and it reared its head back to bite into my face or neck or wherever, and just as it began to strike, my phone went off with its shrill ringtone displaying FATHER EVANS and brought me out of my paralysis and halting the demon's assault. The demon roared and vanished leaving the trail of demonic goo still sizzling on my blanket. \n\nI lay on my bed shaking and shivering, great rolling convulsions wracking my body. If it had not been for that phone call it would have gotten me, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell this story. I will never take that cross off ever again no matter what.","30":"My mother had always told me to stay out of trouble. She always told me to never get into situations where I would get hurt. She told me this almost every single day. For context, I\u2019m a 16 year old, and I would get into fights frequently at school. I wouldn\u2019t win every single one, but, I would leave whoever I fought hurt enough for them to have a bloody nose or a black eye. My parents always got pissed, and I couldn\u2019t blame them. I got myself into a situation where I got hurt.\n\nI had 2 best friends. John and Landon, and we live out in the suburbs of Chicago. My real name is Ashton but my friends simply called me Ash. We were explorers, and we loved exploring abandoned places, whether it\u2019s houses, woods, or even asylums. Farmhouses creeped us out the most. That must be why we love them so much. \n\nToday was a Friday afternoon, and it was going to be one of those days where one of us found some creepy abandoned place in the middle of nowhere. I was the one who found it. I didn\u2019t even mean to. I was riding my bike on the sidewalk, in the woods, in an area that I\u2019ve never been in before, when I turned my head and saw an abandoned farmhouse. I couldn\u2019t get a good look at it through the branches of the huge ass trees surrounding me. I fought my way through the branches and I saw that it was 100% abandoned. It did look like it was in bad shape. The roof was near collapsing, the doors were knocked down and the walls, that were once painted red, was slowly losing its color and the wood was peeling off. Excited, I quickly called John and Landon, and told them to \u2018get the fuck over here right now.\u2019 They never had anything going on, so they told me they would be right over. I said to be quick.\n\nThey arrived in about 5 minutes since I guess they weren\u2019t too far off. John was wearing a green and black hoodie, jeans and a beanie he wore every day. Landon wore a simple white shirt and black pants. I wore a black shirt, brown jacket and jeans. My friends always poked fun at how I always loved wearing colored shirts with my brown jackets, and I\u2019d laugh too.\n\n\u201cI was flirting with some chick on the phone before you called. I called her back and said that someone called me. I guess I should\u2019ve specified that it was you guys because then, she called me a bitch for talking to another woman, and hung up.\u201d John said, stuffing his hands into his pocket.\n\n\u201cI swear, you\u2019re so fucking stupid sometimes.\u201d Landon says, hysterical.\n\n\u201cI still pick up more chicks than you ever will, dickhead.\u201d John laughs, punching him in the shoulder.\n\n\u201cSo is this the place, Ash? It stinks really badly, smells like death, even from over here.\u201d Landon says, covering his nose.\n\nI chuckle. \u201cYeah, I was riding home and I saw it through the trees. Y\u2019all wanna check it out with me or are both of you too pussy?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright, but let\u2019s leave Landon behind.\u201d John says, hopping on his bike and riding down the hill from the trees, towards the farmhouse.\n\n\u201cSounds good!\u201d I yell down towards John. I put my hands on the handle bars of my bike. \u201cSee ya Landon.\u201d I say, before I start to ride down the hill as well, chasing down John.\n\nI hear Landon yell something at us, but I couldn\u2019t make out what it was. It takes me and John about 20 seconds to get to the entrance of the farm, Landon shortly makes it over to us, laughing.\n\n\u201cThis is a lot bigger than it looks.\u201d John says, looking up at the big structure, taking a big breath. I can feel myself shivering from the cold. It wasn\u2019t until now I noticed the smell Landon was talking about.\n\n\u201cAlright, well.. Let\u2019s go.\u201d I say, getting out a flashlight I keep in my backpack and shining it in. All 3 of us walk in.\n\nI shine my flashlight around the what was once living room of the farmhouse. Everything was knocked over like someone has been here already, and the wallpaper that was once on the walls were practically almost off the walls. There was dust everywhere. I even saw a rat run by, that made Landon yell and step back, which got a laugh from me and John. We go into the next room, which was the kitchen. Same deal with the living room, with cupboard drawers spilled out on the floor. There were no silverware, and the microwave and oven were smashed and pretty much destroyed.\n\n\u201cOkay explorers,\u201d John starts to mimic a Steve Irwin voice. \u201cYou two go down the right hall and explore that side of the house, and I\u2019ll explore straight ahead upstairs.\n\n\u201cAre you sure you want to split up?\u201d I ask nervously.\n\n\u201cCome on, you got Landon with you, albeit he\u2019s a stick so he won\u2019t be able to defend you if someone attacks you two.\u201d John snickers.\n\n\u201cYou know what, Ash, let\u2019s just go down the hall, let\u2019s leave him to die.\u201d Landon says, smirking and walking down the long hall.\n\nI look at John. \u201cStay safe.\u201d I say, turning to follow Landon, but before I do, I turn back to him and add \u201cif you see a girl up there, don\u2019t fuck it up this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up.\u201d John says, pushing me into the wall, then starting to run upstairs whilst yelling \u201cLandon, Ash told me he has a giant crush on you!\u201d\n\nI shake my head and I quickly run down the hall and see Landon poking his head into different rooms. They were all guest rooms and a bathroom, all pretty much the same; dirty, worn out with everything in them broken. Including the toilet in the bathroom, which Landon said he really had to go take a dump. I told him to do it outside if he really needed to. We find nothing really interesting, so when we opened the garage door,  we weren't expecting much, but the overwhelming smell that me and Landon smelt when we weren't even that close to the farmhouse got so bad that we both gagged a little bit. \n\nI raised my flashlight since it was quite dark and me and Landon walked into the garage, covering our noses with our shirts.\n\n\"And I thought your breath stunk.\" I say to Landon.\n\n\"Shut the fuck up before I yank your shirt from your nose and make you inhale this nasty ass smell.\" Landon says. We both laugh.\n\nWe walk around the garage, finding nothing that could've been the source of the smell. I hear Landon from behind me going through stuff on a work bench that I passed by and didn't pay much attention to. I was just looking around the garage, which was infested with cobwebs that I kept running into.\n\n\"What are you doing, Landon?\" I ask. Landon doesn't answer. \"Landon?\" I ask again. After a few seconds of no response, I turn around and see Landon staring down at a piece of paper, his face white like a ghost.\n\n\"Landon?\" I say again, more worried now.\n\nWithout saying anything, Landon hands me the piece of paper without looking at me. I grab it and look down at it. \n\nI had no words. \"What the fuck..\" I say.\n\nIt was a photo. A photo of a dead body. \n\n\"Dude, there's even more!\" Landon says, his voice cracking. I can tell from the tone of his voice. that he was really scared.\n\nI peer over his shoulder with the other photograph in my hand. There were at least 4 more photos of dead bodies. I couldn't make out their gender since their face was bashed in so badly. There was blood everywhere in the photos. I wanted to gag.\n\nThat's when I noticed something.\n\nThese photos... I recognized the room in the backgrounds. I don't know how from the minimal light there was, but there were the rooms we were just in.\n\nThese photos were taken in this farmhouse.\n\nThat's when we sensed where the god awful smell was coming from.\n\nLandon looked at me and I looked at Landon, and we looked down at the work bench, at the 2 little doors that worked as a mini closet.\n\nMe and Landon were scared shitless, but we knew what we had to do. I leaned down and opened the doors, where flies flew out immediately and we saw a garbage bag, a garbage bag that was crunched up, a human being was in that bag, it smelt so much worst now with those doors open, there was blood all over the garbage bag, but it didn't look like it was on the outside of the bag, it looked like it was inside the bag, the garbage bag didn't have it's black color it normally is, instead it's a dark, crimson color. I realized then that we made a mistake going into an abandoned place that's blocked off by the forest, hidden to the naked eye.\n\n\"Landon, we have to get the fuck out of here right now-\"\n\n\\*Bang.\\* \n\nIt sounded as if someone grabbed a sledgehammer and slammed it down onto a cinder block. That's when I remembered; John.\n\n\"JOHN!\" I scream, sprinting out of the garage, I run as fast as I can through every corridor of the hall, and up the stairs, Landon was right behind me, he knew it too. \n\nI jump up the stairs, 3 steps at a time, and run up to the room where the noise came from. It was the master bedroom. The bed was covered in blood, there were multiple pictures on the floor, shattered, and there was dust and cobwebs everywhere. \n\nIt takes me a second but I see it. On the floor, right next to the bed. It's John. John's corpse. He had multiple stab wounds in his back, and a big red spot on the back of his head. Landon came rushing in and he saw it too and I could hear him quiver. I wanted to call 911 right then and there but I knew it was probably too late. I rushed to John's side and checked his pulse... And there was no pulse. I could feel myself beginning to cry, when I noticed a tall, large figure standing in the open closet. I hadn't noticed it opened. The man was holding a knife and a camera. I needed to get out of here.\n\n\"LET'S GO MAN,\" Landon screams, running at me, grabbing my arm and pulling me out of the room as the man walks out of the closet. I could see what he looked like, though not very good. He was wearing all black. A black beanie, black jeans and a black hoodie. I can't even come to words what his face looked like. It looked like nothing. It looked like something that was once a man. He had a human face but his eyes.. There was nothing. \n\nBefore me and Landon ran out the door to our bikes we could hear the man snapping photos, possibly of John's corpse like he did with all those other people he murdered.\n\nMe and Landon biked out of there. We didn't have time at that moment to digest what happened to John. What that man did.\n\nWe cried.\n\nWe cried for weeks on end.\n\nThe details are just now coming back to me, I can finally put everything into words, but right now I wish I couldn't. I wish I didn't see that farmhouse. I wish I didn't call my friends to check it out. I wish we didn't split up.\n\nWhoever that man is, I hope you rot down in hell, not only for what you did to John, but what you did to all those other innocent people, for your sick and twisted pleasure.\n\nBut most of all, I miss John.\n\nMy life hasn't been the same. Landon has stopped talking to me. I don't see him at school anymore.\n\nI wish I could just forget.","31":"I knew I wasn't getting a husband today, but I still had to wear the same robe I was given at fifteen (now practically threadbare), and go to the annual matching ceremony. Pansy watched me with her typical feline disinterest as I prepared myself, and she yawned and curled up on my bed as I waved goodbye and walked out into the night. \n\nAfter hiking up the highest hill in our commune, I sat on one of the mats reserved for the unmatched, studying the nervous girls in the hut with me. Soon, all the boys that turned fifteen this year will enter, meet with us, and make their choice. Whoever they choose must accept, as it was Eor\u00fee's will and we must abide so He'd continue blessing our lands.\n\nI used to feel humiliated at these ceremonies. Most girls get matched on their first attendance, at fifteen. A few may get lucky a year or two later. But me? I was already thirty-five and still as single as ever. \n\nThe community pitied me at first, but the older I got, the more they started avoiding me. Especially the young unmatched girls. They didn't want my curse to rub off on them.\n\nHonestly, though, once I hit twenty, it felt more like a blessing than a curse. We were taught from childhood that a girl's purpose was to serve her husband, and at fifteen, I desperately wanted to prove my worth. But as I grew older, the council didn't know what to do with me, so they had me tend to their gardens, still serving men until a man matched with me.\n\nAlthough I lived in a hut on their property, they left me alone, for it was improper for men to interact with unmatched girls, no matter their age. Their wives and children left me alone too, due to my aforementioned \"curse\". And it was then that I learned how wonderful it was to be independent. Just me, my little hut, the gardens, and Pansy.\n\nI was still forced to continue attending the ceremonies though, but I began enjoying them. Certain none of the boys would choose me over one of the younger girls, I'd relax and watch their awkward courtship rituals, trying to guess who'd match with who.  \n\nAfter a few years, my predictions became flawless, especially after I began drinking dandelion tea before the ceremony. Intrigued, I experimented with herbs, roots, and flowers from the garden, and soon I could even foresee the matched's futures. I was certain I was tapping into Eor\u00fee's will due to my connection to His creations.  \n\nA bell chimed, and I adjusted my patched robe and smiled as a train of teenage boys entered the hut. They walked the perimeter, chest puffed as they studied us. The girls were not supposed to look, but a few were peeking. Raised far from boys, this was their first exposure, and some were visibly trembling.\n\nTwelve boys, twelve girls, not including me. After I assigned names for each of them in my head, I observed. There was definitely a connection between Ash and Daisy. She was one of the peekers, and his gaze kept traveling to her. \n\nCedar was roaming around Rose, but she wasn't for him. Hyacinth was. He'd figure that out once they started talking. I sensed a strong connection between Lily and both Fir and Cypress. Two boys had matched with one girl before, though it wasn't as common as one boy matching with two girls. \n\nA second bell chimed, and the boys made a beeline for the girls they liked most. Begonia was mobbed by four, much to her shock, though I had to admit, she was the most beautiful. Only Oak would match with her, though. As expected, no one approached me. \n\nI watched Cedar make his way to Hyacinth after a quick chat with Rose. Poor Rose was on the verge of tears, but I knew she'd end up with Elm, who was currently talking to Iris. Fir and Cypress both had their chance to sit with Lily, and now they were talking to each other. Yes, I see it clearly now. They'll both match with her, and she'll bear them four children.\n\nZinnia and I were the only ones not talking to anyone. She was glaring at me, possibly blaming me for her unpopularity, but she needn't worry. She had a match. I looked around for him and realized he wasn't here. I didn't know what he looked like, but none of the boys in the hut were her match.\n \nI heard a slight commotion outside and frowned. Something was going on. Something different. I could sense Zinnia's future becoming hazy. And mine was shifting. I sat up, feeling dread for the first time ever. Zinnia's match was now mine. \n\nBefore I could process this change, a boy was pushed into the hut. He stood at the door looking uncomfortable, but not as uncomfortable as I was. This was Zinnia's match. *My* match. \n\nI named him Pine as I watched him talk to the girls he liked, and it was obvious he had a connection with Zinnia. But I still saw his future with me. An unhappy future, for the both of us.\n\nEither Eor\u00fee changed His mind, or I was wrong for once in my life. I hoped for the latter, because there was no way I was letting Pine match with me, even if I went against everything the ceremony stood for.\n\nOnce I made up my mind, I sensed a new shift and sighed with relief. Pine was going to match with Zinnia. I saw it bold and clear again. They will have two kids, a boy and a girl. \n\nWhat I didn't expect was Pine walking over to me. Everyone turned to us, a hush taking over the hut. This was the first time any boy had sat in front of me, and he looked as awkward as I felt.\n\n\"Eor\u00fee's blessing,\" he mumbled, focusing on his cuticles.\n\n\"Eor\u00fee's blessing,\" I said. \n\n\"My name is Sindun. What name may be its match?\"\n\nHe was following the courtship dialogue we were taught at fifteen. I didn't even remember it, and I didn't need to. I wasn't vying for his match.\n\n\"My name is Willow, and I think I am too old for you.\"\n\nHe looked up at me, his expression teetering between shock and offense. \"You do not make that decision. I do. And Willow is not a name. It is a tree.\"\n\n\"Yes, I gave myself that name.\"\n\n\"What is your real name?\"\n\n\"Willow is my real name.\"\n\nHe clenched his jaw. \"Very well. Eor\u00fee's blessing.\"\n\n\"Eor\u00fee's blessing.\"\n\nHe stood up and went to another girl, and the hut became reanimated again. I still sensed that Sindun would match with Zinnia, so I relaxed and chuckled to myself. Perhaps he was just curious about the older woman amidst the teens.\n\nA third bell chimed, and all the boys exited. After a fourth bell, us ladies followed them down the hill and to a field. All the matched men of our commune had already congregated there, sitting on the grass in front of a wooden stage. Up on that stage stood the esteemed members of the council. The boys lined up on the left and the girls on the right, and the matching validation began. \n\nA council member called for Wilig, and Ash climbed up on stage and announced that Eni was his match. I smiled as Daisy walked up and put her left palm over his right and her right palm under his left. The council member sprinkled dirt over their hands and thanked Eor\u00fee for His blessing, and we all applauded. Afterwards, the matched left the field together.\n\nAs always, all my predictions were correct, and soon it was only Zinnia and me on the girls' side and Sindun on the boys' side. I was glad it was almost over. The older I got, the more taxing I found this useless standing. I couldn't wait to get back to my hut, drink some chamomile tea, and tell Pansy about tonight.\n\n\"Sindun,\" the council member said.\n\nSindun shuffled up to the stage. \"With Eor\u00fee's blessing, I have chosen Willow to be my match.\"\n\nI froze, my heartbeat accelerating as Zinnia glared at me. This couldn't be right. I still sensed him with her.\n\n\"Fes,\" the council member said, calling out my birth name. \"Come up to the stage.\"\n\nI walked over in a trance, and Sindun held his palms out, his face stoic but his hands shaking. It was obvious he didn't choose me. But this couldn't be Eor\u00fee's will. I could sense it. This was wrong.\n\nI glanced at the men in the audience. None were shocked. I looked at the council members. I saw relief. This was their doing. I was an outlier. A thorn in their side for twenty years. A question they couldn't answer. So they cheated to quiet everyone's unease. But I wasn't going to stay silent.\n\n\"You made him choose me.\" \n\n \"You dare undermine Eor\u00fee's will?\" one member asked.\n\n\"Eor\u00fee's will is for Sindun to match with her.\" I pointed to Zinnia. \n\n\"Are you claiming to know Eor\u00fee's will?\"\n\nThe threatening accusation in his tone made me pause, fear seeping into my indignation. \n\n\"All I know is that I am not Sindun's match. Look at him, he does not want me.\"\n\nSindun remained quiet as he looked between me and the council. He was as afraid as I was. They shouldn't have roped the him into their repulsive plans.\n\n\"It is blasphemous to claim to know better than Eor\u00fee,\" the eldest council member said.\n\nI blinked in shock. \"I am not claiming to know better than Him, I am supporting Him!\" I pointed again. \"He wants Sindun to match with her, and they are to have a son and a daughter.\"\n\nWhispers rippled through the crowd, and I shrank into myself, afraid I'd said too much. A strange premonition overlapped my vision, and I gulped as I saw myself running through the trees, Pansy in my arms. It was dangerous for me to stay here. I had to run.\n\nI turned away, but a strong grasp on my arm pulled me back. I looked at the offending council member in alarm. This was the first time any man had touched me. He was breaking their own rules, and the crowd's whispers turned to gasps.\n\n\"You are a witch,\" he spat. \"You have been manipulating our futures and bewitching the ceremony attendees so you can remain unmatched.\"\n\n\"What?\" I stared at him in utter disbelief. \"How would I do that? *Why* would I do that?\"\n\n\"So you could be in proximity to our quarters, to spy on us and control us!\"\n\n\"That position was your choice, I had no say!\"\n\n\"And so you could tend to our gardens,\" he continued, not listening to me as he addressed the crowd. \"She wanted access to all our plants for her potions.\"\n\n\"I do not make potions!\"\n\n\"She has been manipulating us from the start! Cursing our crops! Making our children sick! Ruining our peace! She has been working against Eor\u00fee to drive us away from His blessings!\"\n\n\"Witch!\" the crowd yelled, jumping up.\n\n\"She must be stopped!\"\n\n\"Burn her!\"\n\n\"No!\" I struggled against the man holding me. \"Let go, I am not a witch! I have done nothing wrong!\"\n\n\"She is trying to manipulate us!\"\n\n\"Subdue her!\"\n\nI screamed as the men descended on me, my desperate thrashing futile against their ropes and resolve. They shoved a scarf in my mouth and tied me to one of the stage's pillars, and I gasped as the eldest council member grabbed one of the surrounding torches.\n\n\"By Eor\u00fee's will, we shall rid our community of the witch that had been plaguing us with her impure ways.\"\n\nI looked with dread at the faces glaring at me, my frantic heart pulsating against the tight bonds. They were ready to burn me for something I had no hand in. My celibacy was Eor\u00fee's will, and my solitude theirs. Why couldn't they see that? Why couldn't they accept me?\n\nHe turned and brought the torch closer to the stage, and I squirmed and pleaded, the coarse ropes abrading my skin and threadbare robe. I squeezed my eyes shut, my panicked breaths wheezing as I prayed to Eor\u00fee. Beseeched Him to save one of his most loyal followers.\n\nThe crackle of the torch got closer, and my tears soaked the scarf as the heat of the flames taunted my trembling flesh. I peeked through my eyelids, the eager expressions on the men's faces terrifying as they awaited my incineration.\n\nI bucked and thrashed, bleeding, crying, begging, but it was the bolt of lightning that stopped them in their tracks. I looked up at the cloudy sky, shuddering as thunder rumbled around us. Was Eor\u00fee answering my prayers?\n\nA single drop splattered at my bare feet before a torrent followed, the chaotic rain merging with my tears. I looked at the men, sniffling, certain they would see this as Eor\u00fee's intervention.\n\n\"What should we do?\" someone asked.\n\n\"This is Eor\u00fee's will,\" a council member said, making my heart leap.\n\n\"Yes,\" another agreed. \"Women must also be present, to discourage such acts. Please forgive us Eor\u00fee for our haste.\"\n\nMy heart dropped. \n\n\"We shall prepare a proper execution tomorrow at high noon.\"\n\n\"What about the witch?\"\n\n\"Leave her here. Let her experience the wrath of Eor\u00fee.\"\n\nI yelled in despair, but they ignored my muffled pleas as they left me alone. I dropped my head, my hair forming a sopping cage around my weeping face.\n\nI wished I really was a witch, then I could've turned them all into weeds. What was wrong with being different anyway? I did the best I could with the life Eor\u00fee dealt me. I cherished His creations, predicted His will, and appreciated His blessings.\n\nI lifted my head, squinting against the biting rain as I clenched my jaw on the scarf. If all that made me a witch, then so be it. At least I'd die for something I believed in. I didn't want to live in this intolerant community anymore.\n\nA soft touch around my ankles startled me and I looked down to see Pansy by my feet. My heart strained as she sat and blinked at me, the rain matting her silver fur. I didn't know if anyone would care for her after I was gone.\n\n\"Oh, Pansy,\" I thought. \"I am so sorry. I did not mean to leave you like this.\"\n\n\"You haven't left me yet.\"\n\nI gasped, staring wide-eyed at her as a wry voice echoed in my head. \n\n\"So, you can finally understand me. Took you long enough.\"\n\n\"Am I hallucinating?\"\n\nShe licked her paw. \"No.\"\n\n\"You are \u2026 not a cat?\"\n\n\"No, but I've taken the shape of one. I'm a familiar, here to help you understand your abilities.\"\n\n\"My abilities?\" \n\n\"Yes.\" She stretched. \"There aren't as many witches as there used to be, technology has stopped them from connecting to Mother Nature. Fortunately, you were born a witch *and* had the perfect environment to cultivate your abilities. Unfortunately, you were also brainwashed to the point I almost gave up on you.\"\n\nMy mind was reeling. \"I am \u2026 really a witch?\"\n\n\"Yes, though not in the way they're accusing you of being. You can't cast spells or manipulate people, but you do have a connection to Mother Nature's flora.\" \n\n\"That is the second time you mention Mother Nature. Who is she?\"\n\n\"She's everything natural from under the sea to the sky.\"\n\n\"Is that not Eor\u00fee?\"\n\n\"Maybe that's what they called her back in the day, but your kooky community twisted her into some strange deity. Mother Nature is a lot more accepting, as long as you treat her right.\"\n\n\"Is she the one who answered my prayers?\"\n\n\"No, she doesn't do that. She acts for the greater good, so it seems she has high hopes for you.\"\n\n\"Is she the reason I never got a match?\"\n\n\"No, that was my doing.\"\n\n\"You?\" I said in shock. \"Why? How?\"\n\n\"I've got my own abilities, and I used them to protect yours. If you'd gotten matched at fifteen, you'd never have cultivated your skills.\" She blinked her amber eyes. \"Are you upset?\"\n\n\"Well, I was at first, but then I was glad I did not have to serve a man.\" I paused in thought. \"Are my relationship predictions from you too?\"\n\nShe snorted. \"No, that was your interest, not mine. You figured out which plants aid in divination. They can help you predict a lot more than relationships, by the way.\"\n\n\"But they never did.\"\n\n\"Because you never needed them to. The ceremonies were your only mystery in this boring little commune of yours.\"\n\nI paused as I remembered my latest vision. \"I did see myself running. With you.\"\n\n\"That's a good sign. It means we're getting out of here.\" She walked to the edge of the stage. \"We should get moving before morning. There's a coven not too far from here, they'll take us in and give us a safe place to practice.\"\n\n\"A coven?\"\n\n\"Yes, a group of other witches.\"\n\n\"There are others?\"\n\n\"Yes, though not exactly like you. You're botanical, while they're a mix of atmospheric, aquatic, faunal, and mineral. They've also lived in the real world instead of a backwards commune.\"\n\n\"The real world?\"\n\n\"Yes, cities, electricity, cars, internet, phones. When I used to disappear for weeks at a time, I was out there trying to learn what I could as times changed.\" She tilted her head at my confusion. \"Don't worry, you'll get to know everything once we get out of here.\"\n\nMy pulse raced with excitement and renewed life. \"I am ready!\"\n\nShe curled up. \"Alright, that's good to hear. Now free yourself.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Use your abilities to escape. Summon a vine with sharp thorns to slice through the ropes or strong roots to rip them apart.\"\n\n I blinked, dumbfounded. \"I can do that?\"\n\n\"Yes. Now show me.\"\n\n\"But \u2026 I do not know how.\"\n\n\"Then you better figure it out quick before morning.\"\n\nI shot a nervous glance at the huts in the distance. \"Please, Pansy, I do not even know where to start. Can you not untie me?\"\n\nShe sighed and jumped off the stage. \"I was hoping you'd at least try before asking for help.\"\n\n\"Wait, come back! I'll try! Pansy!\"\n\nI shot muffled yells at her as she walked away. With the rain still pouring, I looked around in despair, clueless and forsaken. With no other options, I stared at the grass, willing it to grow thicker, longer, and sharper. Despite Pansy mentioning our lack of spells, I couldn't help but chant in my head as I wiggled my fingers, urging the blades to live up to their name.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, I dropped my head, panting from exertion, my eyes stinging and my body aching. I guess I wasn't getting out of here. Even my prediction was wrong. I was a failure as a witch. So much so that the familiar who was patient enough to wait twenty years abandoned me in disgust.\n\n\"Stop moping, I didn't abandon you.\"\n\nI jerked my head up to see Pansy trotting over with a rusted piece of metal in her mouth.\n\n\"Pansy! I tried, I really did!\"\n\n\"I know.\" She hopped up on the stage and placed her front paws on the pillar. \"Here, grab it. Careful, it's sharp.\"\n\nI took the metal from her and got to work slicing through my bonds. \"Did you read my mind?\" \n\n\"Not really. We communicate by direct thoughts at each other, but your self-loathing was quite loud. Are you done?\"\n\nI flung away the last coil. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good. Ready to run?\"\n\n\"Let's go.\" I looked down. \"Should I carry you?\"\n\n\"That would be nice.\"\n\nI cradled Pansy and followed her directions as I ran through the trees. \"Do you have a name, or should I keep calling you Pansy?\"\n\n\"I have a name, but after twenty years, Pansy has grown on me. I'm just glad I didn't first approach you in between the sneezeworts instead.\"\n\nI didn't think anything could make me laugh after today, but I chuckled. \"Pansies are beautiful, they are one of my favorite flowers.\"\n\n\"I'm honored.\"\n\n \"So, at this coven, I will learn all my abilities?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What will I be able to do?\"\n\n\"I can't wait to find out.\"\n    \n\\------\n\n[SR](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SkittishReflections)","32":"Personally, I think it was a mix of teenage hormones and lust, more than anything else, that killed Bobby Thompson. It really had nothing at all to do with Kevin Schrader, but was more about Bobby\u2019s insane crush on our blonde, leggy classmate--and Kevin\u2019s neighbor--Tricia Hanson. \n\nBobby wasn\u2019t a big guy, wasn\u2019t very athletic, and didn\u2019t have much going for him in the brains department. Neither was he blessed with the God-given good looks of some of his peers, so I guess he figured it was his only shot to win her affection. At least that\u2019s what I want to tell myself; I don\u2019t like to think about the part I played in the whole thing.\n\nKevin and his dad lived on a plot of five or so acres of Florida swampland, just north of Okechobee. The property contained a small pond that was just large enough to contain a baby gator or so, a variety of fish, and I\u2019m certain more than a few water snakes. Attached to one end of the pond was what appeared to be a small, wooden house which contained the pump that operated a fountain in the middle of the pond. It was Kevin\u2019s weekly job to unlatch the padlocked pump house door, crawl inside, and clean out the inevitable dozen or so rat carcasses that would be present. It was a nasty job, for sure, but Kevin always said the weirdest part was that all that would remain of the rats was their perfectly-intact skin, as if something had sucked the bones and meat right out of their tiny bodies.\u00a0\n\nOf course, we all had our suspicions about who the culprit could be: snakes, raccoons, Florida panthers, cats, weasels, and other rats, just to name a few. The problem was that, back in those days, we didn\u2019t have such things as \u201ctrail cams\u201d and remote digital recording devices and such that we do now, so we had no way of knowing.\u00a0\n\nThus, the day came when Kevin\u2019s dad was away on another of his frequent, multi-day business trips. As will occasionally happen when teens are left alone, we had an impromptu get-together at Kevin\u2019s house. I remember it was me, Kevin, Tricia, Bobby, Kenny Johnson, and Ty Bellows who were there. Kevin was showing us the inside of the pump house, which was barely big enough for the pump and its power supply, let alone for a human. Bobby was on the small side, though, so we laughed when he showed us how he could crawl in there. Jokes were made about how he was a rat and he\u2019d get killed if he spent too much time in there. Then, almost in an instant, the joking turned to seriousness.\n\nBobby--speaking to the rest of us, but with his eyes focused directly on Tricia--said, \u201cYou know, what would you guys give me to spend the night in here?\u201d I offered an amount of $50; he accepted, but I think it was the unspoken promises in Tricia\u2019s eyes that made him ultimately take the bet.\n\n\u201cTomorrow night. We\u2019ll do it tomorrow night,\u201d Kevin said.\u00a0\n\nSomehow we all managed to make it over to Kevin\u2019s the next evening. Parents didn't really watch their kids as closely back then. Well, not Ty. Ty couldn\u2019t get a ride. That\u2019s probably why he\u2019s still alive...\n\nAround ten o\u2019clock, I padlocked Bobby into the pump house. Kevin let me do the honors since I was fronting the cash. Bobby had only a small pocket-knife and a flashlight on him. There wasn\u2019t room for more than that. \u201cSee you in the morning,\u201d he said with a smile and a wink at Tricia.\n\nThe plan was to keep a watch on Bobby overnight and he would flash the light through the small gap in the door if he needed any help. As far as we can tell, he never did, but we were more than a bit drunk by the time the night was over. Kenny thought he heard screaming about 3:00 A.M., but it turned out to be a passing owl. By 5:00, we were dead asleep.\n\nOver six hours later, we finally woke and remembered Bobby. I can still see us running down to that pump house, in various states of undress, ripping off the padlock, and discovering that--I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to tell you--our friend was gone. All that remained of Bobby--lying in a neat pile on the floor of the pump house--were his clothes, teeth, and blood-encrusted scalp of deep-brown hair.\n\nThat was the last time the group of us hung out together like that. The authorities quickly arrested Kevin\u2019s dad; he did quite a bit of time in the local jail, while they conducted the investigation. As for Kevin, he was relocated and spent his last year as a minor in Tallahassee. It had been our senior year of high school, so we went our separate ways after graduation. I\u2019d thought it was all over; a raw memory that would slowly fade with the passing of years.\u00a0\n\nBoy, was I wrong. Whatever or whoever got Bobby that night, I think--no, I *know*--it\u2019s already gotten to some of the others, and I feel that time is quickly running out for me...","33":"Yesterday, my wife was going through her childhood photos. There were pictures of her riding her bike, hanging out with siblings, talking with friends - the lot. It seemed like there were so many of them - little black and white snapshots of her life. It made me nostalgic for my own childhood. \n\n\nWell. I say childhood. I don't know if you could call it that. I spent most of my childhood in an orphanage. Apparently, my mother had had too many children, and I, as the smallest or the runt of the litter, was turfed out onto the streets. Somebody must have found me; I ended up at the orphanage the next day. There were times where I wished they hadn't taken me there, and they'd just left me to die, but that's another story. \n\n\nAnyways, back to the orphanage. The orphanage belonged to a large, stately woman called Mrs. Reed and her husband, Mr. Reed. \n\n\nMrs. Reed was a formidable presence. She lurked around the orphanage, her beady eyes narrowing whenever anyone walked past her. She was the haunt of the corridors and the beast of the bathroom. Nothing ever got past her. Those clever, sharp eyes could always see through you, and she would question you until you confessed your crime. Still, she was the one who put food on the table, so it's not like we could disobey her. Because of this, everyone hated her.\n\n\nHer husband, on the other hand, stayed up in his study, chained to his desk \u2018til God knows what time of night. I only saw him twice during my time at the orphanage. Yes, that's right. Twice in the space of more than a decade. Once was when I first got there; he introduced himself to me. The second time was a bit later on - when I was in my early teens. I didn't see him any other times. We would get punished if we went up to his study. And nobody wanted that. \n\n\nPunishments were harsh at the orphanage. Mrs. Reed gleefully doled them out every so often, taking great joy in seeing children cry and whimper fear. I got punished several times when I lived there, and let me tell you that it isn't any fun. Punishments would range anywhere from missing dinner, to getting locked up in the basement for an entire week.  I once heard Mrs. Read cackle with mirth after she dragged a 5 year old to the basement. Needless to say, the poor kid was traumatized.\n\n\nRules were very strict at the orphanage too. No talking at dinner, no going outside, and no fighting were just a few. All of these were dealt with with the usual punishments. \n\n\nHowever, there was one rule that everyone stuck to. The \u2018Don\u2019t leave your dormitory after 8 pm\u2019 rule. It was the only rule that Mrs. Reed really enforced. She would patrol our rooms at night, making sure no one got out. \n\n\nShe also tainted that rule with fear. There were always stories, way before I came, about children wandering out at night and never returning. Little Johnny left his room for a drink of water and never came back. Miranda needed the toilet and left the room. She also left the orphanage. Forever. Freddie forgot about the rule and vanished. I laughed at this at first, even scoffed at it. I wasn\u2019t gullible like the rest of these fools. I knew a story when I heard one. I knew that Mrs. Reed wanted this rule to be kept, and lacing it with fear must have helped. At one point, I even helped spread the rumors! They were just silly stories - make-believe to scare the little kids at nighttime.\n\n\nAt least that\u2019s what I thought. That\u2019s what everyone thought.\n\n\nI was friends with a boy named Ethan at the orphanage. Ethan was a bright, social boy, who was friends with almost everybody in the orphanage. He would always make me laugh, or try and cheer me up. He was a good kid, probably around my age, maybe slightly younger. He wanted to become a stand-up comedian when he was older. \n\n\nBut then, one day, Ethan disappeared. Completely. Nobody knew where he went. Well. Almost nobody. There was a little boy in our dormitory named Jack. He claimed to have seen Ethan slipping out of the dormitory on the night it happened. I didn\u2019t believe him, of course. I didn\u2019t want to believe him. No one did. But something told me that he was right, and I grew warier and warier of the rule. I never left my dormitory, and always made sure I was in bed by 7:45 pm at the latest. That was when I was around 10.\n\n\nThen, on the night of my 14th birthday, something changed. That night, I was raring with energy. I couldn\u2019t stay still. I needed to get up, to move. If I stayed in my bed any longer, I would explode. I wanted to get up and go. By this point, I had almost forgotten about Ethan. Or, at least, I didn\u2019t give a fuck about the rules anymore. \n\n\nThe moon was full and bright as I slipped out of bed and put on my slippers. I had to get out of this room, I had to move! I tiptoed to the door and listened. Silence. Mrs. Reed had probably gone to bed, it was too late for her. I tentatively turned the knob on the door, my stomach fluttering with excitement. \n\n\nI opened the door. There was no one there. The orphanage was so quiet, so peaceful. I sighed contentedly and strolled towards the big window. I peered out of it. The world looked so perfect from here, covered in blankets of white and decorated with icicles. Too bad I lived in an orphanage. A small snarl from behind me made me yelp. I covered my mouth, my eyes wide, my heart racing. I snapped out of my trance and whipped around, just in time to see a wolf-like figure. I have been on this planet for 64 years, and that is still the ugliest thing I've seen in my life. Its fur was long and matted, and its claws were yellow and gnarly. And then there were its eyes. Two bulbous, amber eyes, that gleamed with murder. Murder. \n\nI let out a small shriek and looked desperately around for an escape. The humanoid wolf growled at me, a low rumbling sound, daring me to come closer. I never did. I hurtled blindly back to the dormitory, not caring about all the noise I was making, sprinted to my bed, and bolted shut the door. To this day, I don\u2019t know what would have happened if I\u2019d stayed. I would probably have got eaten that - thing - would have swallowed me whole in a few seconds. I did not want to become a meal for a Werewolf.\n\n\nThe next morning, Mr. Reed sheepishly approached me and asked if I\u2019d slept well. \u201cI, uh, heard some noise, and uh, wondered if you were okay,\u201d he said, as he stared at the floor,  his orangey eyes avoiding my glance. I nodded and said everything was fine - there was nothing to worry about. He flashed me a smile and went back to his study. I realized, then. His teeth were the giveaway. \n\n\nDecades later, this still haunts me. There is one thing I learned from this. Don\u2019t EVER let your children out of their room at night. EVER. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re sick, or if they\u2019re going to wet themselves. NEVER EVER. Mrs. Reed was right after all. Please don\u2019t ever make this mistake. I know there might not be werewolves in your house, but there are probably other things hiding out there. Like Vampires and Zombies. Monsters are real. Come to think of it, my wife does like bloody steak. And she hates garlic. She\u2019s also almost as pale as chalk. Almost. Could this be\u2026?","34":"  \n\nIt had been a long 11 months since I had been home. The two month extension was a pain in the ass but not uncommon in the military. The idea of being away from loved ones longer than a person anticipates is a haunting thought and a lot of things can change. I know I did.\n\nYou always hear of the horror stories of coming back home to an empty house or walking in on your partner sleeping with your best friend but I trusted my spouse. After all, it was not the first time I had been away from home for that much time. Also, my wife and I communicated as much as we could during my absence, which reassured me that our relationship was strong and we could endure the time away. \n\nI sat in the back seat of the cab trying to calm myself as I took in the spring greenery. My heart was racing as I impatiently twiddle my thumbs waiting to be reunited with her again. Butterflies flew circles around my stomach as the anticipation climbed. As the cabbie pulled into my driveway, I could already see her waiting outside the front door, smiling with that smile I fell so madly in love with. Tears began filling my eyes as I stepped out of the vehicle. My wife began running towards me and I could see the tears running down her face. As we embraced each other, I felt my heart thudding against her chest. I wrapped my arms around her tightly. It felt so foreign as if I was hugging a stranger. Her skin felt softer than I remembered and her warm lips more full of life than they were 11 months ago. They say distance makes the heart grow fonder and whoever said that had been so right. \n\n\u201cI missed you so much\u201d She said weeping into my chest. I was at a loss of words. It had been nearly a year without seeing her beautiful face. I could have stayed there cradling her against me for the rest of the evening. It was a moment I dreamt about for the whole time I was in that hell. \n\n\u201cAlright, hate to break up \u2018The Dear John\u2019 reunion but I gotta get back to work over here buddy.\u201d The cab driver blurted out to us. \n\n\u201cSorry about that Sir. How much do I owe you?\u201d \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it kid, thank you for your service and God Bless.\u201d \n\nAll of the sacrifice I encountered during deployment had been made worth it by her company. All of the lonely nights and torturous days were washed away by her graceful smile. All of that time, wondering if I would return home safely, was erased by her alluring gaze. I had missed the person I became when I was around her. The barren void had been filled again and nothing was going to drain me of the joy and love I felt. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m back.\u201d *This deployment had been much tougher than the last one*, \u201cHow have you been honey? Sit, please. Tell me how things have been since I left.\u201d \n\nI sat at the kitchen table and looked over to my wife who had started cleaning an already clean counter. She looked anxious and I could feel her emotions seeping out from her pores. \n\n\u201cEverything alright love?\u201d I called out to her. \n\n\u201cI\u2026missed you a lot you know.\u201d Her eyes began to water, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could do another one of these again.\u201d \n\n\u201cIs that what has got you down? I wasn\u2019t planning on reenlisting, so you won\u2019t have to worry about that. Come sit, please.\u201d \n\nShe reached under the sink shuffling things around as she searched for answers. I heard her take a deep breath. \n\n\u201cYou know I love you right?\u201d \n\n\u201cOf course I know that, I would never question that.\u201d I replied to her slightly offended. \n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what makes this so hard for me to tell you.\u201d She began to cry; the tears running down her porcelain skin. I could feel the hairs on my neck begin to rise and a sudden burst of dread began permeating my mind. \n\n\u201cPlease\u2026 don\u2019t tell me.\u201d The confusion of emotions began choking my vocal cords as I nervously awaited her response. She stood there, hands sheltering the remorse on her perfect face. \n\n\u201cI have been having an affair with\u2026\u201d  \n\nA faint ringing found its way inside my head as I tried to process the words \u2018having an affair\u2019. I couldn\u2019t understand the words coming from her mouth as she began to defend her unfaithful behavior. \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019\u2026 \u2018It wasn\u2019t fair of you\u2019\u2026 \u2018I tried\u2019\u2026 \u2018I love you.\u2019\u2026 The annoying rattling behind my eye had fully engulfed the left side of my head and developed into a knee buckling migraine. I could feel the pulses from the migraine syncing with my heart beat. \n\n\u201cPlease say something!\u201d I heard as she raised her voice to get my attention. I took a deep breath telling myself to wake up from this horrid dream I had collapsed into. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u2026\u201d I could feel the pain surging through my left eye causing my vision to fade in and out. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine you with another person. We swore we wouldn\u2019t do that to that to each other. I thought we were\u2026.\u201d \n\nShe crumbled to the floor weeping as she curled herself next to the fridge. She looked how I felt at that instance, fragile, like at any moment we could both shatter into pieces. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go clear my head.\u201d I grabbed my keys and headed out the door. \n\nAs I began driving, I started to question everything that had just happened. \n\nThoughts swarmed into my mind like hornets defending their nest from an attacker. *How did I get to this point? She was my everything. Was all of the hardship and struggle for nothing? What have I done to deserve this? We were in love, right? WHY WON\u2019T THIS FUCKING HEADACHE GO AWAY!?* I began to scream, partly from the pain, the other part from my misery. Unfortunately, the pressure from the headache only amplified as I raised my voice. \n\nI continued to drive on the highway with no destination in mind. *Ding, ding.* I looked down to see my gas light had come on. *50 miles until empty.* Well, hopefully there is a gas station nearby. I searched the dark road for signs. *Nearest Gas Station 20 miles.* Under normal circumstances I would have looked up the nearest gas station on my phone instead of hoping to stumble across one miraculously. Unfortunately I had left my home with so much rage that I forgot it and lord knows I wasn\u2019t about to go back to get it.\n\nAfter following signs to the nearest gas station, I pulled in next to the pump. The place looked like a shit hole, like it had survived the cold war. *Hopefully they have gas.* \n\nI looked over to the sign posted on the shop window *Cash Only.* Luckily for me I had kept cash in my car for emergencies like this. I slowly strolled into the shop and headed towards the counter. The old stale aroma inside reminded me of my grandparents\u2019 home growing up. A poorly written *Press for service* note was left just under a button. I pressed the little red knob *BZZZ!* A loud annoying tone bled out of the back door behind the counter. \n\n\u201cJust one minute please, I will be right with you.\u201d I scanned the counter top at all of the outdated lottery tickets. *1992? How is this place still in business?* \n\nThe only thing that caught my full attention was a basket full of bracelets that looked like they had just been knitted together. The bracelets all had the initials *WWJD*. The migraine had slowly faded away in the 4 hours I had been driving but it was still hard for me to try and piece things together. WWJD? What would\u2026?\n\n\u201cGreetings young traveler,\u201d An elderly man crept in from the back door. \u201cWhat can I do for you today?\u201d His soft voice seemed to pierce right into my heart giving me a small moment of comfort. \n\n\u201cCan I please get 40 on number 3?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, of course young man. We don\u2019t get many people driving these parts nowadays. Ever since the new highway opened up we don\u2019t get too much business.\u201d \n\nAgain, his voice piercing me, I could feel my eyes begin to water. \n\n\u201cAre you alright my son?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long night sir,\u201d I stated, wiping away the forming droplets \u201cThank you. Have a great night.\u201d \n\n\u201cThank you for your service, God Bless.\u201d \n\nI heard him whisper to me as I stepped out of the entrance. *How did he know I was in the service?* I could feel tears running down my face. *What the fuck?* I hastily looked back to see if the shop owner was still at the counter. I saw nothing but a flickering light under the cash register. I guess he went back to watching TV or whatever he had been doing. \n\nI quickly filled up my tank and hopped inside of my car. When I started it up, I noticed that the migraine had disappeared completely. *Well, that\u2019s a relief; I guess I can catch a break.*  \n\nI had no idea where I was heading or if I would return home. How could I face the reality I was left with? Maybe it\u2019s time for a drink; it had been over a year since I had any alcohol. *Not like things could get worse for me at this point.* \n\nThe shadowy roads were unusually empty. Oddly enough, I had not seen any cars coming or going on either side of the road for the entire drive. I drove on for another hour and then I noticed a faint light off in the distance. \n\nAs I neared the light, I began to distinguish the glistening letters of the sign lighting the obsidian night. ***The Choice Tavern*** read the ambient red letters. Pretty dumb name for a bar but I doubted I\u2019d find anything else out here. I pulled up and parked next to two other cars in a small dirt lot, off the side of the highway, a stylish red Camaro and an old Ford pickup truck. *Well glad I won\u2019t be the only one here.* \n\nThe old tavern appeared to be something out of a western film. The windows were blacked out so you couldn\u2019t see inside. There was a dim light above the front door with a small sign reading ***Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week****.* I got out of my car and walked up the small steps, wood creaking with every step I took. As I drew near the entrance, I heard a soft tune of a piano playing behind the door. *Well, good to know there are people inside*. \n\nI opened the door and saw the bartender, a lean man of average height who couldn\u2019t have been older than 35. Both of his arms were covered in tattoos; the left arm, a florist\u2019s dream with flowers of all sorts covering every surface of his skin and his right arm had small lettering like a tablet of ancient scriptures. He stood behind the polished bar top and focused on cleaning small glasses while paying me no mind.\n\nI could tell the bar had been recently refinished, the smell of fresh wood stain lingering in the air. There were several stools in front of the bar with dark leather cushion seats that seemed fairly new, given that the cushions were not worn in. At a table, left of the bar sat a woman reading a book while smoking a cigarette, the jukebox playing a classical piano tune beside her. Her back was turned towards me and I could not see her face, yet her mysterious presence alone somehow drew my attention towards.\n\n\u201cIs it your first time in a pub mate?\u201d I heard an Australian accent say from behind the bar, grabbing my attention back to the counter. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s been a while since I have been in one of these. I was trying to take it all in.\u201d I stated, slightly embarrassed I was caught staring. \n\n\u201cHow bout you take it in with a drink in your hand? What can I get started for ya?\u201d \n\nInstinctively I sat close to the front door. \u201cCan I get a shot of your finest tequila and a\u2026Uh, what kind of beer do you guys have?\u201d I looked to see if there were any taps or a menu somewhere but I only saw shelves filled with liquor bottles behind the bartender. \n\n\u201cUnfortunately, due to some minor renovations we\u2019ve been making recently, we don\u2019t have much. How about I start ya off with something simple mate?\u201d \n\n\u201cSure, I am a fan of simple.\u201d \n\nI began to study his arms a little more intently, \u201cThose are some pretty interesting tattoos\u2026uh, what is your name?\u201d \n\n\u201cYou can just call me Jay and thank ya. These bastards cost me a fortune mate. Hurt like hell too. And trust me I would know.\u201d He chuckled amusing himself. \n\nJay and I exchanged small talk over a few drinks. He told me about the places he\u2019d been and people he\u2019d met all over the world. The one thing that struck me as odd was when I asked him his age he laughed and replied \u201cI\u2019m older than I look mate.\u201d It must be all the kangaroo and alligator Australians eat. \n\n\u201cEnough about me mate, what brought you here to the middle of nowhere.\u201d He asked as his light blue eyes focused solely on me. \n\n\u201cWell, long story short, I had just come back from deployment and my wife\u2026\u201d I finished the rest of my drink finding courage to tell him. \u201cShe had been having an affair while I was away. Telling me it wasn\u2019t fair of me to leave for so long and what was she supposed to do all alone.\u201d I could feel the waves of my anger come off in droves. Jay looked away for a second and began making me another drink. \n\n\u201cNo need to get all crook mate, she ain\u2019t here after all.\u201d He was right. What had been done had been done. Stressing about it wouldn\u2019t take back what she had done and it wouldn\u2019t bring back the people I\u2026 \n\n\u201cGot yourself stuck in a pickle there, ay?\u201d Jay handed me my drink. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a bit lost is all.\u201d I sighed. \n\nThe dilemma was simple: *Would I be able to move forward from this? Should I to go back and try to patch things up or should I avoid home for the rest of my leave?* I had a month off before I had to report back to my command. \n\n\u201cDo you love her mate? And I\u2019m not just talking any ol\u2019 high school love. Would you be able to live without her?\u201d Jay stood back as he spoke like a father to me. I hadn\u2019t noticed how tall he was as he towered over the shelves. \n\n\u201cI want to believe I do, but how could I go back after knowing what she had done?\u201d \n\n\u201cThere is a give and a take for everything in this life we so humbly walk. There has got to be a balance in the world or you end up being swallowed whole by chaos.\u201d \n\n*What did he mean? Did he know about my life in the service?* \n\n\u201cAre you so graciously pure in your vows? Maybe there had been something you\u2019d done while you were away that led her astray?\u201d Jay questioned further. *There is no way he could have known about\u2026*\n\n\u201cNow, now no need to get the man all worked up, Jay.\u201d A soft comforting voice said behind me. I turned my head towards the voice and saw the woman from earlier in all her splendor. She was young and incredibly attractive. Her long amber hair sat perfectly on her shoulders. I was in awe as I stared at her hourglass figure, unable to turn away as she gallantly paced through the saloon. \n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave this poor man alone? Can\u2019t you see his is trying to forget his problems, not live with them?\u201d She reminded me of the Victoria Secret models making their way down the runway. \n\n\u201cYou may want to close your cake hole there; it\u2019s not polite to stare.\u201d Jay whispered sarcastically. \n\n\u201cOh right,\u201d I stuttered, \u201cI am sorry ma\u2019am. I haven\u2019t seen a gorgeous woman in quiet some time. I\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cNo need to be so formal. My name is Lucy and it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.\u201d She said as she stepped into the light reaching for my hand. I had immediately fallen in love all over again. I was devoured by her emerald colored eyes, almost forgetting where I was and what I had been so worked up about. She may have been the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. She was perfect.\n\n\u201cSo enough about that rubbish with your cheating whore wife, I want to get to know a little bit about you.\u201d She uttered warmly interrupting the trance I had fallen in.\n\nI hadn\u2019t noticed the alcohol hitting me until she was sitting next to me. We spoke for what seemed like an eternity; sharing laughs and smiles enjoying the company of each other. Jay chimed in on occasion, but I would pay him no mind. This was the woman I had been searching my whole life for. \n\nJay was right about one thing, I had not devoted myself to another person fully as I vowed too on the day of my wedding. Maybe this was all part of some balance in the universe. Maybe this was a chance for me to start over fresh with Lucy. \n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Lucy began, getting a little closer to me\u2019 \u201cJust because you are legally married, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have a little fun once in a while.\u201d She ran her index finger around the rim of her glass her eyes meeting mine. I could feel my breath shortening as she leaned in closer continuing to gaze into my soul. I turned away sitting still as the thoughts of my wife flashed into my mind. *What was I doing? What kind of man had I become? When did I lose my way?* I tensed as each thought crammed itself into the crevasses of my mind.\n\n\u201cAlright mate, what\u2019s it gonna be?\u201d Jay leaned over in between Lucy and I like an upset parent forcing his good will into my being. \n\n\u201cUh, what do you mean?\u201d I could feel the clarity of my thoughts returning as I questioned him. \n\n\u201cAre you going to patch things up with your sheila or are you going to continue to run away from your problems?\u201d Why would I patch things up with her? She had been unfaithful to me. It wouldn\u2019t be right to go back because I could never look at her the same. \n\n\u201cAnd if she knew about your past, would you expect her to openly accept you back?\u201d \n\n*Was this guy reading my mind?* I hadn\u2019t made a sound since he\u2019d asked me. \n\n\u201cListen man, I appreciate your concern but I don\u2019t want to think about any of that.\u201d I said firmly wanting him to back off. I wasn\u2019t ready to face the reality just yet. *Besides, who is the fucking guy anyway? What the fuck does he know about love and relationships?* \n\nJay sighed, \u201cJust remember, there is a give and a take for every action we make in life. May God Bless you mate.\u201d \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to Mr. High and Mighty self-righteous over there. He\u2019s always trying to save the world one person at a time. Now where were we\u2026\u201d The buzz from the drinking had returned immediately as I glanced over at Lucy and all of my intuition left me once again. She pressed her body against mine as she wrapped her long arms around my neck. She forced herself onto me beginning to kiss me more passionately than my wife ever had. The rest of the night ended up being a blur. \n\n**\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..**\n\nI awoke to the sound of a news channel on the television. I looked around the bland room and noticed the only furniture in there was a wooden stool where the TV stood and the bed I was in. I lifted the blankets to see my naked body. *Well, I guess it ended up being a good night after all*. \n\nI sat up against the headboard and heard the door behind the TV open. I hadn\u2019t noticed a door before. \n\n\u201cWell good morning sunshine! Last night was amazing! Thank you for an eventful evening.\u201d Lucy said as she walked in wearing a fiery red gown, her hair as perfect as it was the night before. \n\n\u201cHey, I don\u2019t really remember much but I\u2019m assuming we slept together?\u201d I asked awkwardly, feeling a minor headache start behind my left eye. \n\n\u201cOh we did A LOT more than sleep together!\u201d She put her hands together cheerfully like a school girl. \n\nI laughed nervously, not liking the sound of that for some reason. \u201cWhat do you mean a lot more?\u201d \n\n\u201cYou sold me your soul silly! You don\u2019t remember?\u201d\n\nI stopped laughing immediately. *Wait, What? Is she psychotic?* *What the fuck does she mean I sold my soul?* \n\n\u201cListen,\u201d she stated as she sat at the foot of the bed \u201cDon\u2019t you remember Jay telling you how this works? There is a ying and a yang in life. There has to be a balance for all things.\u201d \n\nMy throat began to knot as my heart race accelerated. *What the hell did she mean by that? What did I fucking do!?* \n\n\u201cI know, it\u2019s a lot to take in but here, take a look\u2026\u201d She spoke slyly as she turned up the volume on the TV. And there it all was, as tears ran down my face, watching all the sins and atrocities I had brought about. *LT Henson killed in action* the words on the TV driving through me like being hammered with stakes. \n\n\u201cSo basically, what you have done up to this point in your life has finally come to haunt you. Jay offered you many chances to repent for the horrors you committed; but you wouldn\u2019t listen and he only gives out three chances.\u201d She crawled onto my lap, placing her hands gently on my cheeks. I wanted to get up, but my body couldn\u2019t move. \n\nI could hear a faint ringing as I pieced together what she was saying. The room started to heat up and the walls began to bleed away the paint, revealing stone and iron. \u201cWe are going to have so much fun together!\u201d I tried to pull away, but Lucy held me in place, gripping me like a child as she began laughing uncontrollably. \n\n\u201cOh\u201d she said, abruptly ending her laughter \u201cI almost forgot to tell you\u2026\u201d Lucy\u2019s perfect body began to morph. Reptilian wings sprouted from her back as she hunched over stretching her arms out as she shed the human flesh she wore.  The hair on her head fell off clump by clump as she shook her head like a wet dog. Her smile stretched from one end of her face to the other as shark like teeth sprouted from her gums. \n\nI was frozen in place witnessing the transformation of Lucy to the hellish creature standing before me. I had been given a choice to repent for my sins but had thrown it away for one night of pleasure. \n\nShe grabbed my face again, tearing into my cheeks with her newly grown claws. She stared into my soul as her eyes changed from green to yellow, taking the form of a serpents\u2019 gaze. Then came the raspy voice of the devil herself.\n\n\u201cThank you for your service.\u201d","35":" I decided to work at Camp Powhatan because my bank account was dry and the thought of cute camp counselor girls made me horny. I also decided to never work a summer camp again when It ended.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cIf you guys don\u2019t shut up I\u2019m not getting you dessert tomorrow, go to sleep.\u201d\n\nMax, Issac, and Nicki were all sitting up in their bunks tossing a lacrosse ball around, chanting a number after each successful catch. And it was really pissing me off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even tired man,\u201d Max says as he throws the ball to Issac.\n\n\u201cFor real,\u201d says Issac as he catches it. \n\n\u201cEight!\u201d They all yell.\n\nThese damn kids never fucking listen. I\u2019ve tried everything, at least everything I can do without getting fired. I tried telling them stories, I tried playing music, I tried bribing them with candy, for fucks sake, I even tried paying them with my own damn money to get them to go to bed.\n\n\u201cI feel like I could run up the dunes right now!\u201d Issac blurts right after the ball leaves his hand towards Nicki.\n\n\u201cYea honestly,\u201d Nicki says. \u201cI stay up late at home all the-OW!\u201d Nicki grabs his hand and falls to his side, the ball rolling off his bed. The little shit jammed his finger.\n\nWe all sit in silence staring at Nicki as he cradles himself in the fetal position. Then he decided to cry.\n\n\u201cNicki, are you okay?\u201d I say, still pissed.\n\n\u201cDamn!\u201d Issac yells in a whisper. \u201cHe broke his finger!\u201d\n\n\u201cGoddamn it,\u201d I say to myself and get up.\n\nMax and Isacc get quiet as kids do when their friend starts crying. I walk over to Nicki\u2019s bunk and kneel next to him. \n\n\u201cHey Nicki,\u201d I say, my hand gently shaking his shoulder.\n\nHis whimper doesn\u2019t stop and his mouth stays closed. Fucking fuck, I really don\u2019t have the time for this.\n\n\u201cHey come on, let's go to the bathroom and I\u2019ll check it out okay?\u201d \n\nNicki nods and gets out of his shiny blue sleeping bag. Thank god. We both put on our flip flops, I grab my flashlight, and we leave the cabin. I check my watch, 11:43, fuck I gotta hurry. \n\nThe Michigan summer air is a little chilly, which confused me when I first got here. Summer nights in Illinois were always warm enough to lay on your trampoline with nothing but a pair of shorts, a couple of friends, and a six pack from the basement fridge.\n\nThere are no lights on any of the buildings so the whole bay is pitch black. You had a decent sense of where the other cabins and the bathroom were after being here for a few weeks, but during the first couple of days I stepped into a mole hole and busted my ass trying to make it to the bathroom without a flashlight. Nicki and I walk along the beaten path from my cabin with a circle of light guiding the way, the only sound being the humming of cicadas. My flip flops smack on a mixture of dirt, leaves and sand, the crevices of my toes acting like a sieve. Oh yeah, this whole damn camp is built on sand dunes, so there's always sand in my shoes, bed, ass, hair, basically any area or spot that would be annoying if it got sand in it, had sand in it. \n\nThe green bathroom door appears in front of us and I hold it open for Nicki. He\u2019s not crying anymore, good. I flick the lights on and walk over to the counter of sinks and the one long mirror with bugs on it.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d I say after turning the sink on. \u201cPut your finger under the cold water and it'll feel better.\u201d\n\nHe walks over holding his hurt finger with his other hand, his eyes a little red. His hand slowly makes its way under the gushing water that has a yellow tint to it. He winces a bit but it seems to calm him down a little.\n\nNicki\u2019s a pretty funny looking kid, his eyes are really fucked up so it always looks like he's looking at his nose. He also has these glasses that make his eyes like twice as big and it reminds me of this one retard that went to my highschool. I\u2019d be in class and all the sudden you\u2019d hear this distant stomping, and if you were lucky it would keep getting louder and louder until the motherfucker would walk past the door. He then would stick his crooked neck in the classroom and yell \u201cHelloooooo!\u201d, in this voice that sounded like Kermit the frog. I would never be able to keep it together and my buds and I would be dying for the rest of the period.\n\n\u201cAlright lemme see it,\u201d I say with my hand out in front of me.\n\nHe walks over with his finger still being hugged by his other hand. He places his fucked hand onto my palm and I take a look at it. It\u2019s a little purple but it doesn\u2019t seem like anything serious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a little jammed, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I say. \u201cJust try to go to bed and tomorrow we can go see the nurse, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cHmhm.\u201d He nods.\n\n\u201cAlright let's get outta here,\u201d I say. I turn off the sink, hold the door for Nicki, and flip the lights before I\u2019m out. \n\nThe cabin is quiet when we get back. I get in my bunk and tell Nicki to go to bed but he\u2019s basically already asleep by the time I get in my sleeping bag. I check my watch, 11:56, I\u2019ll only be a little late if I sprint my ass down there. I wait five minutes to make sure everyone in the cabin is asleep and then get out of my sleeping bag. I grab my flip flops but then look at my overgrown toenails and decide I should put my shoes on instead. I then put on the fanciest sweater I have that\u2019s clean, grab my flashlight, and slowly close the cabin door.\n\nFeeling sneaky I head towards the main trail. I keep my flashlight off until I\u2019m farther away from the cabins. Leaving your kids alone is one of the worst things to do as a cabin leader and I wasn\u2019t about to get caught. \n\nThe camp itself is really beautiful actually. On the side that faces the lake are these tall and monstrous dunes, and if you spend the fifteen minutes it takes to climb them. you\u2019ll be able to see the lake right above a couple acres of smaller dune formations, dunegrass, sporadic firepits, and the treeline, which if you looked at from above, would make a big U shape. This side of the camp is where the girls camp is mainly located, which is where I\u2019m heading to right now.\n\nThe walk to girls camp normally takes about ten minutes, but I\u2019m trying to make it there in three. Once I\u2019m away from my bay, I start sprinting down the trail. The trail isn\u2019t some straight shot to girls camp, it\u2019s this long and windy trail that's on an incline, and it\u2019s also full of random tree roots and shit that you could trip over. Also there are points that if you fall off the wrong side of the path, you are going to take a long tumble. \n\nTall and thick shadows of trees start to blur the corners of my vision as my legs kick and shoot earth. I keep my flashlight lit right in front of me so I don\u2019t accidentally shine it through another cabin or building and blow my cover. \n\nAs I\u2019m running I hear this low croaking. It sounds just like a frog, but if the frog was inside a tin metal box, so like a reverberating metallic sound. So I guess a robot frog? Or maybe a nearby generator or something? I don\u2019t know. I check my watch, 12:01, one minute late so far but I\u2019m basically there.\n\nAfter hauling ass for about five minutes I start to enter the main section of girls camp. The fat shadow of their dining hall starts coming into view on the right side of the trail so I turn off my flashlight. My sprinting stops and my breathing tries to too, there is a huge bay of girl cabins to the left of the trail so I try to hide myself. As I pass by the dining hall the trees unveil their shadows and I can start to see the other girls' camp buildings and the full moon that lights up the area. There is a circle of buildings that surrounds a big totem pole. I heard that they are actually removing the totem pole after a ton of complaints about cultural appropriation and racism and all that bullshit, I think it looks pretty cool, pretty stupid to remove it if you ask me. They already removed the one in the boys camp during staff training, which was a huge ordeal. \n\nTo the left of the totem pole there is a field with a gaga ball pit, tether ball, and nine square. To the right of the totem pole is the craft house, an administration building, the main security building and housing for the employees that weren\u2019t cabin leaders. Straight across the totem pole is where the lake is, I was close enough where I could hear the waves.\n\nI creep along the right side of the circle, in the shadows of the buildings. The waves get louder and louder and my heart starts beating faster. Ever since the kids have gotten here I have had to sneak around like a fucking cat. Honestly though, it\u2019s been more fun this way.\n\nAfter passing the dining hall, I cut between the administration building and the craft house towards one of the medium sized dunes. There is a really faint trail that has only existed since last week that I start to climb. Climbing a sand dune feels like the most unproductive thing in the world. Every step you take only puts you about one third of an actual step ahead of you, and also, its exhausting as fuck. \n\nAs I\u2019m panting like a goddamn dog on my way up the dune I hear her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re twelve minutes late,\u201d she says with her brown hair flowing in the wind. \u201cI was about to leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I say with my legs just reaching the top. \u201cOne of my kids had a little accident.\u201d \n\nWhile I\u2019m hunched over and catching my breath I look up at Jessica. She stands in the middle of the clearing, surrounded by dunegrass and one pathetic looking tree. Her arms are crossed and a water bottle is gripped in her hand. Behind her annoyed face is the bright moon with shades of deep blue colorations, which reflect off the oddly rough lake Michigan.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I say while walking towards her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\nI go in for a hug and she suddenly seems to flip a switch. She embraces me hard and pulls down on my Ralph Lauren sweater. I kind of want to tell her to knock it off, this thing wasn\u2019t cheap. We hug in silence for what seems like forever before I start kissing her.\n\nI first met Jessica on the second day of staff training. We were both cabin leaders that were learning how to teach archery for the kids that eventually came. She came off as really shy and timid at first, which I really liked, but she got comfortable around me the more I talked to her. I remember helping her with the  form I had learned in Boy Scouts and she seemed to really like that. It then escalated to late night walks around the camp when we had free time, and when she told me she was only sixteen I knew I had to have her, and once I kissed her, I knew it was a done deal. Honestly, she was a pretty easy catch. \n\nAs my right hand is pulling her lower back into me and my left hand is cusping her jaw, I hear that weird metallic frog noise again. \n\nI pull away and ask, \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says. With a cute and confused look on her face.\n\nRight after she says that the noise gets really fucking loud. It felt like it was filling my head and bouncing around my skull. \n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I say, But suddenly it just stops.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jessica asks, looking like a puppy, which makes me ignore the weird sound and start kissing her again but harder.\n\nI gently bring her down onto the soft sand and get on top of her. My lips attack her neck and her tits, making her moan. The young ones always make the most noises I swear. Her hips and ass are gripped and touched by my sandy hands, slipping underneath her pajamas and underwear. As she moans and moans I realize the wind starts picking up, and the waves and dunegrass are getting rowdy and starting to hiss. I notice Jessica becoming a little concerned about it. Fuck, I gotta finish this fast. Her insides start becoming violated by my hands and I begin to take off her pants when we both hear it.\n\nIt sounded like a little kid crying, but not like a quiet whimpering, it was the sound a kid would make if he broke his leg or if he was about to die. You know how if you really spook a kid, like really startle them, they kind of make this gasping shock filled yell, where it's like they are trying to scream but are also trying to catch their breath? It sounded like that but if the screaming was more drawn out and really low, and it also sounded like it was on a loop, kind of like a broken record\n\nI can see in Jessica\u2019s eyes that she hears it too. They open wide and look left and right while I still have her pinned down. I jump on my feet and she follows, her clothes covering her body in an instant.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is that,\u201d I say, scanning the screaming dunegrass that surrounds us.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jessica says with a nervousness to her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just an animal or something.\u201d\n\nThe noise keeps repeating and repeating and it starts to smell like a rotting body. Like the dead deer we found on one of the camp's trails last week. Then the air starts to taste weird, like metal, and my head seems to get full of noise again. \n\nI look over at Jessica and she\u2019s staring at something in the dune grass. I try to see what it is but the sound keeps bouncing around my head, like a ricocheting bullet that only gets faster and faster. I cover my ears but it doesn\u2019t really do anything. I go over to Jessica and grab her hand and pull her towards the way off the dune, I need to get away from this screaming.\n\nJessica and I are obviously freaked the fuck out so we bust our ass down the dune. As we kick sand and try our best to not eat shit, I hear the noise but it seems to get more deranged and out of control, like whatever animal is making it is losing its mind. At the bottom of the dune we keep running into the girls camp center near the totem pole. We stop at the tree and listen, the wind seems to calm, and the air smells and tastes normal, and the noise is gone.\n\n\u201cThat was really fucking weird,\u201d I say while leaning against the tree.\n\n\u201cYea,\u201d Jessica says. She looks really shaken up, I can see her face in the moonlight and it looks like she just saw something horrible. Her arms are crossed, and her hair is messy. Her eyes are also staring right through me and her bottom lip hangs low.\n\n\u201cMust have been a bobcat or something,\u201d I say. \u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d I ask, pulling her towards me a little bit.\n\nShe resists my grasp and keeps her arms crossed. \n\n\u201cYea I\u2019m fine, I just-\u201d She says followed by a short pause with her eyes glued on my shoes. \u201cI just think we should really go to bed, we have to get up early tomorrow and it\u2019s late.\u201d\n\nThis is when I get a little bit pissed off. I had to deal with my little shit kids all night and then I had to sprint through these fucking woods just for Jessica to be too tired?\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I say while cracking a smile, trying to be charming. \u201cLet's hangout a little longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I really just think we should go back to our cabins and sleep.\u201d\n\nThis bitch.\n\n\u201cEasy for you to say,\u201d I argue. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to run across the whole camp to get to your cabin.\u201d\n\n\u201cLuke,\u201d she whispers while looking into my eyes. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nAt this point I could tell she wasn\u2019t going to change her mind.\n\n\u201cAlright fine, I\u2019m outta here.\u201d I say while walking towards the boy camp trail.\n\nJesus Christ this girl can be annoying, I guess that's how they always are when they\u2019re that young.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d She says. \u201cCan you walk me back to my cabin?\u201d\n\nOh my god, fuck off,\n\n\u201cNo I\u2019m really tired,\u201d I say while walking away. \u201cAlso we have to get up early tomorrow, remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she whimpers.\n\nI\u2019m not letting her puppy eyes work on me, I\u2019m done with this shit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really long walk back,\u201d I say. \u201cI really gotta get going.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she muttered faintly with a sad face. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYea bye,\u201d I say without looking back and then start heading towards the trail.\n\nGoddamn that was annoying. I check my watch, 12:48, fuck, by the time I get back and go to bed I\u2019ll only get like five hours of sleep. Being tired and having to deal with campers is the worst thing ever, you don\u2019t know how many times I have wanted to smack the little shits in the head. Usually after Jessica and I hangout, I feel pretty fulfilled and I don\u2019t really mind the sacrifice of sleep. But this time I only feel cheated.\n\nAs I enter the trail back, the tall and deep rooted trees start covering up the sky, it gets so dark you can barely see even when your eyes adjust. I check my pocket for my flashlight and, FUCK, I must\u2019ve left it on the dune. Should I go back and grab it? I can definitely get back to my cabin without my flashlight, but it\u2019ll just be a pain in the ass because I can\u2019t just gun it without being able to see, I\u2019d have to go slow and walk. Son of a bitch this night keeps getting worse. I then think of the weird noise, that smell, and that taste in the air. Fuck it, no flashlight.\n\nUnder the canopy of the forest, my footsteps move with care, I really don\u2019t want to fall down the sides of the trail, I would just about go to my car and leave this place if that happened. Only one more week, I tell myself. One more fucking week. This was my first year working at Camp Powhatan, and though the girls here are cute, the job can really suck. I first heard of the job last semester, one of the professors at my school is the girls camp director and she was always telling us how they really needed male cabin leaders. The job seemed like a good idea on paper, cute girl camp counselors and access to a private beach, it seemed like a pretty good deal. But I didn\u2019t realize how annoying this shit could be. During staff training, I was actually having a pretty good time. You know, talking to girls, hanging out with some of the guys here that weren\u2019t weird. But once the kids got here, fuck that. I never thought eight grade boys were so fucking annoying. They don\u2019t listen to jack shit I say, they are always making sex jokes like its the coolest thing in the world, and I swear to god one of them is always touching himself in the middle of the night. \n\nI check my watch again, the little LED lights up and it reads 12:56. Alright, I\u2019m actually making decent progress without my flashlight. While my thoughts wander and my legs cautiously walk, I hear the sound of a branch falling over in front of me. You know that sound, that ripping and cracking. I keep walking, those damn squirrels should go to bed. Then I hear another branch fall, smacking other branches on its way down and landing a couple feet in front of me. What the fuck. I step over the branch and walk a little fast, I just want to go to bed. Then, this slow cracking noise starts erupting somewhere in front of me. A fucking tree. A huge fucking tree is falling over. I can hear it crystal clear but I can\u2019t see shit. The slow falling timber echoes around me until it smacks the ground, I can feel the vibration in my feet.\n\nFuck this. I keep walking, cautious of the fallen tree, but I never seem to run into it. It must have fallen in some other direction. I come up to a point in the path where it starts to curve around in an S formation. At this point I realize I realize I\u2019m right near my cabin and I\u2019m basically homefree.\n\nI turn a corner and start to make out my cabin and the other buildings around it, when I hear the sound of someone sprinting like motherfucking Usain Bolt in my direction. Shit, I cannot get caught right now, just one more week then I\u2019ll get paid and I can kiss this place goodbye. I step to the side of the trail to let whoever is coming pass by without realizing I\u2019m here. As the sprinting noise gets closer, it kinda sounds a little off, like there was an extra foot or something. And the cadence was weird, it would be one normal step followed by two quick steps. Who fucking knows. Also, I realize that this marathon runner doesn\u2019t have a flashlight. How the fuck can you sprint this trail without a flashlight. I guess some of the staff have worked here for like their whole goddamn life but still, there is no way you are that familiar with the trail. \n\nI lean against a nearby tree to camouflage myself in the woods, feeling like James Bond or something. As the sprinting gets closer I recognize that metallic croaking noise again. The croaking gets stronger and stronger. My chest feels like a drum getting smacked a million times. The footsteps get heavier and I swear they start to shake the ground. Then that disgusting stench comes back. That smell of death, and it keeps getting more potent the closer this guy gets. My mouth starts tasting like metal again too, I smack my tongue a little in familiarity, what is that?\n\nThe taste, sound, and smell, feel like they are almost right in front of me at this point, but I can\u2019t make out any figure on the path. Then I feel it. It feels like something just ran straight through me. It was like I just got shot all over my body all at once. I get really dizzy and the stench is so strong I almost throw up. My head rings and screams with that noise and then, it seems to go away. \n\nI stand there trying to keep myself up, my hand against the tree. I can still hear that sprinting sound but whatever it was seemed to pass me and head down the trail. I\u2019m so done with this shit. I stumble back on the path and head toward my cabin. The whole bay is quiet and peaceful, thank god. I then make my way to the front of the cabin and step up stairs and realize the door is propped open.\n\nWhat the fuck. Why is this shit open right now? I\u2019m almost a hundred percent sure I closed it when I left. I think about it for a minute, just frozen on the steps staring at the wide open rectangle of darkness. It must have been Nicki. We have all been bitching about how he always slams the door when he leaves to go to the bathroom, waking us up. Yea that must be it. \n\nThat little shit, I laugh a little bit, unprop the door, go inside, get in my bed and go to sleep.\n\nI wake up to the sound of the camp's shitty foghorn alarm. The morning is really peaceful for once. Usually I\u2019d have to deal with the kids complaining about getting up, but they seem pretty quiet this morning. I throw off my sleeping bag and pop up out of bed. I start getting ready to shower when I freeze. \n\nAll the beds are empty.\n\nI begin to start panicking. Is this a prank? Are they in the bathroom? Did I wake up too late? I run to the bathroom, nope, not there. I double check the whole cabin, nope. I run over to the other cabins and every single one of them has their kids in it. FUCK FUCK FUCK. I put my shoes on and start sprinting towards the security building in the girls camp. I run as fast as I can, fueled by adrenaline, I am so screwed. Where the fuck are my kids? Even if we do find them my ass is fucking fired. \n\nAs I\u2019m sprinting down the path I pass a big hole in the ground on the side of the trail. Like someone ripped a massive tree straight out of the ground. Then something catches my eye laying inside it, I stop. It\u2019s Nicki\u2019s shoe.\n\nWhat the fuck? What the fuck! My stomach starts to twist and churn. I feel sick and dizzy, like I\u2019m going to faint. I pick up the shoe and start running down the path again, in a panicked haze. I start coming up on the dining hall and the main part of girls camp. I\u2019m almost there. Almost fucking there. I start to hear female screams up ahead, what the fuck is going on?  I run out of the shrouded canopy of trees and into the main area of the girls camp.\n\nEverything freezes. \n\nSurrounded around where the totem pole used to be is a collection of female staff and some girl campers, all panicked and in shock, with tears and hands covering their open mouths. Some are standing frozen, some are lying on the ground crying and shaking. \n\nThe old totem pole is gone. Something has taken its place. There is a thick and fat tree trunk stabbed into the ground, with the branches and leaves all ripped off like someone snapped the tree in half. Carefully carved into the trunk are symmetrical pockets, swirls, and designs. Placed into these pockets and carvings are the pulled apart pieces of Max, Issac and Nicki. Their intestines fill the swirled lines that surround the main attraction. Three stacked heads with mismatching torsos, and arms. The arms are facing the opposite direction, like they\u2019re hugging the tree. The legs wrap around making a V shape under each torso. Next to the totem pole is an assortment of their clothes and shoes, all precisely folded and placed in individual piles. I walk through the shaken crowd, not really registering what is going on, and place Nicki\u2019s shoe next to his other one that has his glasses tucked neatly inside.","36":"  \n\nWhy do you need my name, don\u2019t you have it? Fine. Sorry, I\u2019m still shaken up. You won\u2019t believe what happened to me. I mean that in the most literal sense. Start from the beginning? I\u2019ll do my best.\n\nTwenty-seven banks in three years. Anything to catch the perfect wave. That was the tagline on the poster of the 1991 action thriller starring Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze. Two FBI agents attempt to track and apprehend a group of LA bank robbers before their last job of the season. After that, they will be gone until the next summer. That movie inspired me. I wanted that lifestyle of easy money, adrenaline, and free-living. I\u2019m sure a movie like that might have inspired the good guys to go the other way. To see FBI agents working their asses off to put the bad guys behind bars. Guess I just wasn\u2019t built like that.\n\nBodhi, Swayze\u2019s character, was intelligent. He was handsome, charismatic, athletic. Everything a young man strives for in his formative years. I was maybe 9 or 10 when I first saw that movie, so I was impressionable. I\u2019m not going to say I live my life by that movie or anything. I don\u2019t surf and have never surfed, in fact. The older I got the thing I kept most to me was how they worked. As I progressed in my bank robbing career, I saw the guys I worked with stuck to that basic style: Get in, get cash from the register, don\u2019t go to the vault.\n\nBy the first time I did my first job, banks were much easier to hit. As with everything, technology was limited in the bank system. Most areas I hit didn\u2019t even have the ceiling to floor bullet and blast proof glass. You could jump over the teller and force them to give you every bit of cash they had in the register. Two minutes was the standard. One guy kept time, making sure we didn\u2019t stay over that mark. After that, it was ghost time.\n\nAs the years went by, tactics changed. Dye packs were becoming more popular, and we worked around that. Glass started going up. Security beefed up. A lot more planning was necessary to come away with the maximum amount of return possible. I became a part of that process the more experience I got. I worked my way through the \u201cranks,\u201d of bank robbers. That also meant I was entitled to a larger slice of the pie when all was said and done. I always looked at this as a real job. This is how I made money and financed my own life. I never married, never had any kids, and didn\u2019t have many real relationships. It\u2019s kind of hard when your life is taking part in felony jobs every month.\n\nI always carried the necessary amount of firepower the job called for. Thankfully I never had to use it. Like the point man always said to the customers and employees, \u201cthis isn\u2019t your money, it\u2019s insured.\u201d No one had to die for a few thousand dollars. I fortunately never ran into any \u201cheroes,\u201d that wanted to cause problems during the robbery. No rent-a-cop security guards, no off-duty cops ever tried to stop us. We were too good and too fast. The quicker we were in and out, the quicker everyone could go about their lives. \n\nAfter a good decade I finally acquired my own dream crew. \u201cTurbo,\u201d was our getaway driver and vehicle guy. He always had a line on a new hot ride. He had his own connections to a vehicle that could disappear as needed. And it was always fast. Turbo knew how to drive like the devil. \u201cTree,\u201d was the main enforcer in my crew. He came highly recommended from a friend of mine I started with but got out of the business fairly early on in life. I\u2019m not sure where he went, but I imagine he followed the felon\u2019s retirement plan: either he died, or he\u2019s sitting on a Mexican beach somewhere. He gave me Tree, and that\u2019s all I need to remember about him. Tree was an intimidator, a real bad dude who had no qualms about busting someone\u2019s nose with the stock of an 870 shotgun if they needed it. It showed the rest of the folks in the bank to just lay down, and let what was happening, happen.\n\nThe closest thing I had to a best friend in this business was my second in charge. We simply called him \u201cthe timekeeper.\u201d He oversaw the time we got in and the time we exited. He kept all of us honest and on track. He also served the dual purpose of planning the hits with me. Supposedly he had a master\u2019s degree of Psychology from the University of Los Angeles. None of us got too personal with each other. That was one of our hard fast rules. Don\u2019t get too close. I have lost one or two guys during a job. I don\u2019t want to get into that right now.\n\nThat brings us back to me, the star of the show. They call me \u201cHollywood.\u201d I have a penchant for theatrics I suppose. I found myself becoming the leader or point-man the more I did these jobs. I had a natural way of speaking with people that were getting robbed. I don\u2019t want to brag but I consider myself kind of attractive. I just happened to have that long sandy-blonde hair that Swayze had in Point Break. I guess I was always meant to follow in Bodhi\u2019s footsteps. As poetic as it would be, we didn\u2019t wear ex-president masks or anything. Our standard dress was tactical type pants, jackets, and ski masks. Classic, but practical. \n\nI did follow the ex-president\u2019s method though. We hit a specific group of banks in a period of 3-4 months, and then we were gone. Leaving the local and federal law enforcement groups scratching their heads, waiting for us to strike again. When that would be, well we made that hard to guess. The worst part of my job is always looking over your shoulder. When we weren\u2019t working, we lived normal lives. As normal as they could be. I always scanned my daily life though, seeing if I was being followed by strange looking vans, sweeping my home for bugs, and keeping up with the police blotter. It was worth it though. To live a lavish life and have everything you ever wanted, just by knocking off a few banks a year.\n\nThe last job I did changed all that. I don\u2019t know what I saw that night. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll never know, and I\u2019ll be haunted until the day I die. Do you want me to go on?\n\nThe only difference in this job was the time we did it, for starters. Usually, I planned on going into the bank in the middle of the day. A good 2 PM job was the best. Statistically the lowest traffic time for bank activity. Today though, for some reason I scoped out this bank that closed at 8 PM on a Tuesday. I wish I never hit this one. I thought we\u2019d get a much bigger return that what we were looking at. The bank closed at 9 on this particular day. That means that one hour before close they should have the maximum amount of cash in the registers before they put it back to the vault for the night. These days, there isn\u2019t as much cash transactions, so it\u2019s hard to predict how much we could get. It\u2019s become something of a crap shoot as to how much we could come away with. This isn\u2019t ideal for a highly skilled group like us. We would like to know as close as possible to what we exactly were looking at stealing. This night we didn\u2019t steal anything. I was stolen from.\n\nMy crew was all set up. Turbo was in the driver seat of the Monte Carlo. I was in the passenger seat. Tree and Timekeeper were in the back. The bank was running as it was supposed to. Nothing out of the ordinary. The sun was just starting to dip. Still plenty of light. We always worked best in the light. We didn\u2019t worry about being seen. It would be impossible to identify us anyway. We all wore the exact same dress with the exact same ski masks. Today we chose green. No reason. We all had similar builds, especially with the Kevlar body protection. Except Tree, he towered over the rest of us. The plan was in motion and should have carried out like every other time. But it didn\u2019t.\n\nHollywood did his thing. That\u2019s me if you forgot. I\u2019ve become accustomed to speaking about myself in the 3rd person, like a true Hollywood man. \u201cEveryone on the fucking ground!, palms down! No one needs to die tonight, all of your money is insured. The bank will be fine, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d is how I started it, like always. Tree threw one of the security guards to the ground, aiming his shotgun at his head. He scanned the room like a menacing sentinel. I heard the squealing tires as Turbo took off around the block. He would swing back around in a minute and a half to pick us up. No reason to have the evidence parked out front in case the Police showed up early, which they never did. We tested the response time several times over the last few weeks to this place. The first squad car showed up in 3 minutes. That gave us plenty of time.\n\n\u201cOne Minute Forty,\u201d Timekeeper screamed. We were only there for 20 seconds, that that was our cue to start getting moving. I walked up to the teller window. Tree walked beside me, to the other window. Our eyes usually convey what we need from the employees: \u201cJust put the money through the little slot, lady.\u201d They did as they were told, even though we didn\u2019t say a word. We both watched as they shoved hundreds, then thousands of dollars under the little opening under the window. Multiple bills with Benjamin, Jackson, and Hamilton flooded into our duffels. We didn\u2019t bother with the small bills.\n\nAs I watched the money pour in, humming the \u2018We\u2019re in the money,\u201d tune inside my head, the lights went black. As I said it was still very much light outside. Now it was black. No light from the windows. No light from the inside. The ugly fluorescent lights shut down. They didn\u2019t break or anything, they just went dead.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on Hollywood, did you plan on cutting the power?\u201d Tree yelled. I didn\u2019t plan this. \u201cKeep your cool Tree, I don\u2019t know what this is, just grab what you have and start making your way toward the door. TK, what\u2019s our time?\u201d No response. \u201cTK, where we at?\u201d Again, nothing. \u201cTree, let\u2019s go!\u201d I yelled, my voice showing more concern than I\u2019d like. I didn\u2019t hear a soul breathing in that place. I figured they already left. I zipped up my bag and headed for what I thought was the exit.\n\nWhen I turned around, I expected to see the red faint glow of an exit sign above the front door, as is standard with all commercial and government owned buildings. I saw nothing. I started yelling for anyone in my crew to sound off. Then I saw it..\n\nSurrounded by darkness, a woman appeared in front of me. I dropped my gun and slowly started walking toward her. I was caught in her gaze. I felt like everything was ok. I felt an intense, warm feeling of acceptance. I was getting closer and closer, without walking on my own. After being moved to this woman, I stopped a foot away from her. I closed my eyes. When I opened them, two red pupils stared back at me. My body was frozen in shock for what felt like an eternity. The eyes lit up like the fire of hades, and now I could make out the rest of her face. Her nose was gone, her mouth opened impossibly large, revealing no teeth or tongue, just a void of black. I could feel her inhaling, like she was preparing to load any and all energy she could to release on me.\n\nAs she inhaled as much as she could, she paused. And at this moment I paused, and everything went quiet. I watched my childhood. I saw my parents, both good people, push me on a swing on the playground. I thought about the chances I had, the choices I made. And then.. destruction as she screamed red fury into my face. I couldn\u2019t shield myself, I tried to close my eyes, but the sheer force of her voice kept my eyelids from shutting. She was pulverizing me. I couldn\u2019t lift my arms, I couldn\u2019t move anything. I was frozen in fear and panic. Our brains work in strange ways during extreme stress. I kept hearing a voice tell me to give up, give in. . . and then I woke up.\n\nWhite, clean room. Boring fake wood desk in front of me. Harsh fluorescent light overhead. Dr. Friedland stares at me. \u201cDo you remember anything else Adam?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why he keeps calling me that. I never gave any real name, I never do. I\u2019m Hollywood.\n\n\u201cNo Dr. It\u2019s never changed. I\u2019ve explained this to over and over again. I passed out after that demon succubus melted my face off. I\u2019m sure I got arrested, and now I\u2019ve been here in the Psych ward, trying to explain what happened.\n\nDr. Friedland scribbled into his little secretive notepad, as he did in all our sessions. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll never get to see those notes. As long as I get out of here, I don\u2019t care. \u201cAre we done?\u201d The good Dr. nods his head, shuts his notes, and knocks on his door. This always signals the orderly to come and escort me back to my room.\n\nDr. Friedland picks up the phone as Adam gets shuffled out. \u201cHey Bill. Yea, he\u2019s fine. Same story, yep. He thinks I\u2019ve been talking with him much longer than I have. I think this is only our second session since he\u2019s been here. You remember he wasn\u2019t ready to be seen for quite a while. For \u201csecurity,\u201d reasons.\u201d \u201cYeah, he sure does. He is staying with that story that he was a bank robber. I know.. People cope with life in very different ways.\u201d","37":"Yesterday, upon the stair... I met a man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. I wish, I wish he'd go away...\n\n - Hughes Mearns\n\nMy little brother has always had a very wild imagination (he's 9) and he's the type of kid to make up stories to seem like he can relate to others, my mother has always been very open to the paranormal\/supernatural, myself being the skeptic, so I often deflect or change the subject when she brings these things up.\n\nOne day we were in the living room chatting and she brought up this man she had seen standing in the driveway staring at the house, when i asked her if she thought it was real or not she said she couldn't tell but he was abhorrently tall, claming he was 7 or 8 feet. I told her she likely experienced pelopsia from being frightened, she was in a rush and this took her by surprise.\n\nEnter my little brother, he immediately chimes in saying \"no! He really is huge\" I ask if he knew who the man was and if he had seen him anywhere else. He nods and claims that he has seen him at school watching him and his friends from the basketball court, this immediately sparks outrage in my mother. Some creep is stalking kids at school and has now made an appearance at our home, it's time to take action! She calls the school demanding that they take measures to ensure that nothing happens to the children at school and to improve the staffs surveilance of the premises.\n\nHe goes on to tell us that he's seen the man inside our home as well, most notably at the foot of his bed. Making strange clicking or tapping noise. I immediately suggest that we change the locks and look into a home security system, we lived in a pretty good neighborhood at the time and we never had security concerns there before, now our door had 3 locks on it with cameras everywhere. \n\nSkip ahead a few years and nothing occurs. The man seems to have stopped coming around the school and our home. We felt safe. My bestfriend came over one day, we've been through a lot and i trust him with my life, he has keys to my house and makes himself at home as he pleases. I was downstairs in the game room playing video games with my little brother when my friend comes down the stairs saying \"whose that weird lookin' $#&% in your kitchen? Wouldn't even say hello!\" I'm baffled and wordless. My mother was not home and it was just me and my brother gamin out on a day off. We were alone, or so we thought.\n\nMy brother grabs his bb gun (he's about 13 at this point) and arms himself for the worst, i calmly jog upstairs knowing my homie has my back if this goes sour. We get upstairs and theres no sign of anyone coming in. The windows were closed. The door was locked properly. My friend asks about our cameras and i decide this is a good idea. They're all on the doors and sides of the house. There are no cameras that give a good look into the kitchen but we'll see how he got in and out guaranteed. \n\nSo we pull some chairs up to the computer and open the security providers playback exe. And we watch the last 8 hours at x 10 speed, slowing down everytime we notice someone approach the house. The mailman. My mom leaves. Our neighbor lives alone and comes over to talk frequently (i lived alone for a while and sympathise with his loneliness) \n\nThere was no sign of anyone entering our home uninvited. The house was empty and i felt foolish, Justin (my friend) is a party animal and works night shifts, coming over to my house without having slept first was a regular thing for him. He must have just been tired, seeing shadow people. I tell him to go to bed and he crashes in my room. Dinner time rolls around, my mom comes home, Justin comes upstairs and they eat, I barely touch my food as I struggle to wrap my head around the situation. \n\nThere was someone or something, that knew how to enter our house and exit without using the doors or windows. A tornado of problem solving storms through my mind all night. Whoever it was knew a lot more about us than we knew about them. They knew every inch of our house. And they likely knew our first line of defence was the only one. I had to prepare for the worst.\n\nJustin and I enter the garage and I explain that the person he saw upstairs was the creep we had problems with before. And that I was uncomfortable dealing with the situation myself. I was at a loss for words and ideas. He suggests that we go for a walk, it might help clear my head and i could use a smoke anyway so i agree. I grab a fresh pack of smokes and we leave at about 10 pm.\n\nWe walk down the street toward the school and talk smack about the weirdo stalking kids. We stop in the playground and sit atop the bench, I light a smoke and we share it, after I pass it to him I pull out my phone expecting a message from my girlfriend as she should be finishing work soon. It was 10:13 pm.\n\nWhat i saw was absolutely perturbing. I was shaking, hands trembling as I stared at the photo of Justin and myself sitting on the bench. Justin noticed me trembling as he handed the smoke back to me. \"You about to nic out on me man? You can have the rest of that if you need it\"\n\nComing to my senses I stumble off the bench and look behind us toward the dimly lit basketball court. Justin quickly got up to help me and looked in the direction my eyes were locked to.\n\nThere he stood. A colossus of a man, shroud in darkness. I saw no details, no eyes, but I could feel it. He was staring at me as intensly as I stared at him. I scramble to rise to my feet and fill my fist with my lighter, we grew up in the ghetto so defending ourselves was not a new concept. But this was very different. Not only was he massive but he terrified me.\n\nHe knew where we were, what we were doing, and clearly had an advantage if he was so ready to expose himself. He likely knew that we were unarmed, I quickly scanned the environment for any chance to improve our odds. There was nothing. We were alone and i had 1 lighter and a pack of cigarettes. Our only hope was to either run or fight until our dying breath. \n\n\"What the &%$# are you lookin' at?!\" Justin barks at the figure. It bolts without any sort of windup, this thing is sprinting faster than i've ever seen anyone move. Yet there was no stride. No weave. It seemed almost robotic the way it held it's form while moving so quickly.\n\nJustins jaw dropped, allowing the cigarette to fall to the ground as he turned, grabbed me and made my decision for me. It was time to run. We sprinted for the gate in the schoolyard fence as fast as we could. Out of breath i begin to slow down. That must have been the fastest i ever ran in my life. I was no athlete and i felt myself buckling. We were not about to outrun this thing and we needed every ounce of energy we had left to defend ourselves. Planting my feet i stop almost instantly, shouting for Justin to do the same, he could see my exhaustion and knew I would need his help.\n\nReady to fight for life and limb we look back searching for whatever it was, but it was gone. It moved with ease, far faster than we could, was he running a flank? The field was dark and we barely saw eachother let alone anything else around us. We pause for a moment and realise that if we can't see him then he likely can't see us.\n\nWe drop to the ground and scan the field, laying on our bellies. Listening. Watching. There was nothing. No footsteps. Not a thing in sight aside from the  playground equipment encased in moonlight, and the basketball court with it's single floodlight. \n\nAfter catching our breath we jump up and run the rest of the way home. We discussed what had happened for hours when we arrived. We must have been loud when we came in, my mother came out of her room and asked what the ruckus was, she heard us shouting outside and thought we had gotten into a fight. I messily explained what happen and apologized for waking her up, she was confused, she had not gone to bed yet and had been watching tv in her room. I was as confused as she was. We had been gone for at least 2 or 3 hours. \n\nI took a seat in the living room in an attempt to calm down, i begin to feel the weariness of sleep take over, i look up at the living room clock and it read 10:15. There was a ticking noise. It wasn't the clock. In a panic i remember that this man had regularly visited my brother at night, we were gone for hours! How was it that only minutes passed? I ran for my brothers room and burst in.... \n\nLast night upon the stair, i saw a little man who wasn't there. He wasn't there again today. Oh, how i begged him to stay....","38":"Wyatt Flemming went missing in the summer of \u201819.\n\nThere was no write-up in the newspaper, no 6 o\u2019clock special on the news.\n\nTo his loved ones\u2014 he was lost a long, long time ago, when he chose life on the streets over the recovery center. To the city\u2014it was easier if someone like him disappeared. Council overwhelmingly supported the relocation bill, which had the goal of revitalizing the streets of Freemont and creating a safer downtown core. All the tents were folded up, the shopping carts loaded into vans. Hundreds of vagrants and street walkers were displaced from the corners and alleyways that they had been occupying for years. They were shipped from the bustling downtown metropolitan area to the outskirts of the city limits, near the forests and the gravel trails that led to the Gully. Far away from the five-star restaurants, the high-rises, the boutiques. They had been dumped near the newly erected rehab facilities and low-income housing units. As far as the city was concerned, they had all disappeared.\n\nSo, no one batted an eye, not for a vagrant. If he wasn't my brother, I probably wouldn't have cared, either. \n\nI made my weekly wellness check, a piping hot styrofoam plate filled with a serving of meatloaf in hand. I took the typical route, along the tree line, just off the gravel path. When the scent slapped you, the razor-sharp whiff of acidity, of piss, you knew you were heading in the right direction.\n\nI slowly trotted down the embankment, to his usual spot. The tattered, blue polyethylene tarp was strung across four  pencil-thin pines. His pile of clothes underneath, reeking of whiskey and unwashed armpit. This was home. \n\nAs you got closer, the smell worsened. It choked you, forcing a palm to the bridge of your nose. A rusty shopping cart with the Pay-Less logo on the handle was pushed up against a fallen tree, filled to the brim with a man's life-long accumulation of belongings. Nestled into his carefully curated blanket of leaves and foliage pillows, his el-naturale mattress, lay a lonely, half-empty bottle of Jack. That's when I knew something was wrong. Those two were inseparable.\n\nI trudged through the rows upon rows of trees, ignoring the pricks, the pine-needle arms that brushed up against you, pulling you in. I was following a squishy dirt-moss-leaf soup, a thin trail of the murky water leading deep into the forest. I called out for Wyatt, hoping the trees would carry my voice to him.\n\nI was searching for footprints, signs of struggle, anything that would lead me to my brother. I made it all the way to the edge of the forest, to the entrance of the Gully. It was a steep drop-off, the side of the hill caved-in to form a deep ditch. Inside the ditch, I could see a dark pool. As a kid, we used to call it the Witch\u2019s Cauldron. It was a sign that a storm was brewing. The belly of the Gully\u2014full.\n\nI called out for Wyatt, again and again.\n\nI returned to his home every few days for the next couple of weeks. The bottle of Jack, still in bed all alone.\n\nI contacted the police, the Freemont Herald, the Channel 5 news. Anyone that would listen. \n\nNo one batted an eye, no, not for a vagrant. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe expansive stretch of forest was divided in two by the rip in the earth that we called the Gully. To the north, there were popular hiking trails and picnic spots for the family. To the south is where Wyatt was found, near the relocation housing effort. The police reported that they had searched the entire south side looking for Wyatt. They searched the adjacent river, the one that fed spring water from the mountains to the city for consumption. They told me it  was highly unlikely he made it to the other side given the depth of the Gully, and even more unlikely that the Gully had been full. It would have taken a torrential downpour to cascade enough water from the river into the carved bowl. Their best guess was that he fell down the cliff and tumbled into the river, where his body was carried somewhere downstream. How far downstream? They weren't sure.\n\nTheir solution was a 4\u201dx4\u201d yellow sign at the entrance of the gravel trail that read:\n\n*PLEASE KEEP OUT OF THE GULLY*\n\nThe legacy of my brother was reduced to an image of a stick person, falling. A metal pole stuck in the ground was all that was left.\n\nI punched the hood of my car as I left the precinct. \u201c*Fuck\u2019em*, \u201c I muttered to myself, \u201c *If they can't find answers, then I will.\u201d*\n\n \\*\\*\\*\n\n\u201cThis city\u2019s gone to shit,\u201d my friend Eddy declared in the backseat of my car. He had his head poking out of the window, his long, stringy, mocha strands flopping in the wind. Outside of city limits, we were passing pumpjack after pumpjack, on our way to the gully.\n\n\u201cWhat are you complaining about, Ed?\u201d my other friend, Shariff, scoffed. \u201cHow else do you plan on paying for that big-ass apartment?\u201c He looked back at him, \u201cNobody eats in a recession.\u201d\n\nEddy rolled up the window. The flashlights rolled around in the backseat. \u201cI just mean it used to be better. Before the bloody foreigners went and bought up all the property.\u201d \n\nHe wasn't wrong. Business was booming in the city, as we rode another economic peak. Awaiting the valley, and then the inevitable crash that would follow. It was the rollercoaster ride of the oil and gas sector. You had no choice but to hold on and hope you survived the ride.\n\nThe transient community weren\u2019t the only ones being forced out of Freemont. The city had become popular. It had a lot to offer, with its low taxes and being situated so close to the mountains. Things were changing quickly, you could feel it. New property development was popping up everywhere you turned. Apartment units were being stacked to the sky, one on top of the other. Developers were snapping together these lego-piece homes as high and as wide as the city permitted. To find anything affordable, you had to look elsewhere. The average person was pushed further and further out into the outskirts, resulting in urban sprawl.\n\nA lot of the city's essential services followed suit\u2014the recycling facilities, the water treatment plants, the dump\u2014they all had to be relocated further and further away as the city began to expand.   \n\nI parked the car and we walked past Wyatt\u2019s memorial sign. The wind bit through our fleece jackets, an odd chill for a summer evening. \n\nEverything in his home was how I left it\u2014the piss stench, the half-empty bottle. \n\nWe continued south, hollering his name. Flicking on the flashlight as the sun began to dim. We passed other homeless encampments, other campers finding solace in the wilderness. Those that were coherent had confirmed they hadn't seen Wyatt in awhile. \n\n\u201cWe need to cover way more ground,\u201d Shariff said. \u201cI think we should split up. It will be dark before you know it.\u201d \n\nWe agreed to meet back at the sign at 9:30pm. We all marched off in different directions. \n\nI called out his name, turned over logs, and looked under bushes. There were still no signs of him anywhere.\n\nWhen 9:30pm hit and the sun began to hide behind the huddle of trees, I made my way back to Wyatt\u2019s encampment. The sky was a charcoal-grey, the rain pattering down soft droplets that were partially sheltered by the canopy of the trees. \n\nEnroute, I heard a screech so deafening it rustled the trees. It made my stomach turn as I sped off in the direction of sound. \n\n\u201cWyatt!\u201d\n\nI sprinted towards the screaming, the trees scratching and clawing me as I ducked and weaved through . It led me to the edge. I looked down into the Gully.  Smoky-black water sloshed around, tree branches and debris floating, trapped, inside the carved-out crevice. No sign of Wyatt. Just murky-grey puddles around the edge of the cliff. A thin trail of it coming from the forest. \n\n\u201cWyatt!\u201d\n\nI followed the trail of slosh to a dead end in the middle of the forest. The abrupt stop gave me goosebumps, tingling up my spine.\n\nIt was pitch-dark now, water pouring down from a dense arch of clouds above. Every rustle, every stir, made me wield the beam of light in my hand, like a sword. I heard long, drawn out howls that made me shudder. I tried to trace my steps back through the void, the never-ending maze of trees. It felt like I was making loops upon loops, the trees' sharp fingers pointing me around in circles.  \n\nI had never been so happy to smell the odor of urine. I had no idea how long I was out there before the piss-tent revealed itself.\n\nJust past the blue tarp, I could make out a figure. Another beam of light.\n\n\u201cShariff? Eddy?\u201d\n\nI shone the light at the figure's chest. His long, chocolate hair was drenched and covered in leaves. \u201cEddy! Where\u2019s Shariff?\u201d\n\nHis eyes got wide. His stare empty and astray. \n\n\u201cI was hoping he was with you?\u201d\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen Payton Mckenzie disappeared, the public finally began to take notice.\n\nPictures of her were popping up everywhere\u2014her shiny, golden locks curled up into spirals, her icy-blue eyes staring back at you with a glimmer of optimism that only children have. She had a face that people cared about. It was the face of innocence.\n\nA cropped shot of her in a family photo was plastered on every light pole in suburbia. The fyler read: \u201c*Payton Mckenzie - Help us bring her home*.\u201d The story spread like wildfire. Every news outlet was replaying a fifteen minute interview with the parents where her mom and dad were begging the public for help. \n\nTheir extended family was having a picnic get-together on the north side of the Gully. Payton\u2019s parents must have lost sight of her, only for a moment, while the adults were mingling about adult things around the barbecue. She must have wandered off, just a little too far from her siblings and cousins. And a little too close to the Gully. \n\nAll Shariff\u2019s disappearance did was put the microscope on me as a suspect. I had nothing to hide, so I told them everything. The cops completed another search with the canine unit sniffing out the trail, divers searching the river and rescue boats looking for bodies. They came back with nothing. \n\nBut someone like Payton didn't just go missing. Not without a public outcry.\n\nThe story broke the hearts of every mother and father in the city. Search parties were organized pronto, candlelight vigils were scheduled immediately. We all needed to bring the girl home, the one that could have easily been our daughter. We had all enjoyed picnics north of the Gully. We had all hiked a trail in that neck of the woods. \n\nI decided to join the search party because I needed something to do, anything to fill the sunken, empty feeling that lingered in my stomach. I considered the blood of Shariff to be on my hands. And while part of me feared the absolute worst, I still had to believe my brother and him were still out there. \n\nThere must have been fifty of us gathered in the north side parking lot.  We were equipped with flashlights in hand and whistles around our necks. I was placed in a group with a lanky fellow named Paul and an older lady in a cardigan named Edith. \n\nPayton\u2019s mom, Gweny, was holding up a map that had been sectioned off in colored marker. She motioned to our group with a gentle smile that did not match her bloodshot eyes, \u201c You guys search the south-west corner\u2014here,\u201d she pointed to the map. The south-west corner of the map, a pocket of land closest to the Gully. \n\nThis side of the Gully was much less wild. The trees seemed to crowd you less, their stalking felt less forceful. You felt like you could actually breathe, like today, maybe we had a chance.\n\nThe north side had gone through extensive landscaping to create a family-friendly picnic destination. It was a parks initiative that council felt made the city more attractive. It had worked, typically the barbecue pits were booked up solid for the summer. Before Payton's disappearance. \n\n\u201cPayton!\u201d we all screamed. Groups of us headed in opposite directions, on our dead girl scavenger hunt. \n\nWe had searched for a couple of hours, hiking in the woods, examining smudges in the dirt that could have been footprints. Everybody played detective, while Payton played hide-and-seek. \n\nEventually we stopped for a break, leaning against some trees. The unstable terrain and occasional incline had knocked  the wind out of Edith.\n\n\u201cI just need a moment,\u201d she said, beads of sweat collecting on her forehead. \u201cYou youngins don't know what it's like to have 70 year-old knees.\u201d \n\nPaul and I chuckled. The afternoon sun looked like it was baking every bit of Paul\u2019s pasty body. His face was beet-red, the sweat dripping down his large forehead. He pulled out a granola bar and began eating as we all rested in silence. \n\nIt started with a trickle. A thin trail of earthy-grey. The liquid snaked around a cluster of trees, in a slow drizzle. I wouldn't have even noticed it, had we not come to a complete stop. I watched it pool up, slowly. The murky-grey getting darker and more opaque. Paul and Edith were staring off into space, observing the tops of the trees. Payton\u2019s name was echoing in the distance.\n\nI didn't think much of it at first. It could have been a tiny leak from a nearby drain pipe or maybe some sort of tiny offshoot from the river. But the puddle got deeper. Too deep, spreading out in a small wave behind a tree. \n\n\u201cUh..guys!\u201d I shouted.\n\nThe shallow puddle had gathered into a thick, dark, sludgy pool that had oozed itself around Paul\u2019s feet. Before he could look down, a mucky tentacle wrapped itself around him. It yanked him under, the pool swallowing him up. His body disappearing into the viscous glob, like quicksand. He let out an ear-splitting scream. \n\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d Edith shrieked. \n\nI tried to lunge at him, hoping to grab on to an arm and pull him out. It\u2019s orange beady eyes glared back at me. And then they were gone.\n\nI rushed after it. Edith, with her geriatric knees slowly following behind. My legs were wobbly, my heart thrashing in my chest. The thing that consumed Paul was quickly flowing away. \n\nThe thick gob was almost swimming now, moving like a viscous tidal wave, weaving in and out of the trees in the trail of liquid it had entered in. What it left behind was a murky liquid trail that almost blended in with the dirt. Items were being displaced from the monster, slipping out of the gob\u2019s core in a slimy film. \n\nA mixed-berry crumble wrapper. Tiny shoe laces. A styrofoam plate.\n\nIt was leaving behind a strong smell in the wet left-behinds. A mix of methanol and grease and the rotting stink of decay.\n\nI chased with all my might, chasing this thing that was now moving like it was sliding down a slip-and-slide at the local waterpark. \n\nI could see it now. The frac chemicals, the garbage, the human intestines. All swirled up in a big old pot. All brewing for years in the Witch\u2019s Cauldron.\n\nMy lungs burned as I watched the thing wash away, down the side of the eroded cliff. Into the Gully.\n\nI peered down, in horror, as the thing slid into the belly. Swishing around in the eroded half-pipe. A dark pool, it\u2019s nightmarish orange eyes blinking back at me. \n\nEdith caught up to me a few minutes later, gasping for air. A few others came running after hearing all of the commotion. We looked on, helplessly, as the orange eyes disappeared into the swirling liquid.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nPayton\u2019s search party came up empty. The police\u2019s search of the north side came up empty. \n\nAll they had were our stories\u2014first hand accounts of a monster from Edith and myself. A senile lady and a whack job obsessed with a hole in the ground, those were the labels that they gave us.\n\nIn the fall of \u201819, they took a man into custody named Alphonso Heraldo. He was a low life rapist and career criminal. They said that he had been camping out in the Gully and preying on random victims. They said they had his DNA, but I never heard about any recovered bodies. He had a receding hairline and piercing, raven-black eyes. He had a face that people despised. It was the face of guilt. \n\nIt wasn't the fairytale ending for Payton Mckenzie, but at least it was an ending.\n\nA few weeks after the unsuccessful searches, I tried to stop by the Gully to visit Wyatt\u2019s home. I noticed the sign had been replaced. Tall, barbed-wire fences and plastic boards now covered the area. Miles of fences, all confining the vast forest. Hundreds of advertisements hung up from the metal fence poles for new coffee shops and restaurants opening up in the city. The signs change, but the fences still remain.\n\nI haven't slept much since that final visit to the Gully. In my nightmares, I feel the layers of oily muck sliding up onto my face. Its slimy tentacles wrapping around me in a vice-grip, restricting my movement. I try to scream, but I drown in the sludge.\n\nIn this up and coming city, we have pushed away a dark secret. For years.\n\nI noticed something this morning when I was making my coffee. I was reading the paper, patiently waiting for my bread to toast. As I took a sip of water, the way the light hit the glass, I could make out a faint hue. A pale tint of ashy-grey.\n\nI ran to the sink and spit out the water.\n\n*This city has gone to shit.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[aproyal](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/aproyal\/comments\/kpu2co\/please_read_if_you_enjoyed_any_of_my_stories\/)","39":" Dear mom and dad,\n\nI'm writing this just moments before I die. I want you to know it's not your fault. I know you never believed me but maybe this letter will convince you that I wasn't crazy. Or maybe it will.\n\nI first saw it when I was 10. I was trying on mom's jewelry in front of that antique mirror that mom wouldn't let me use. I don't know if it was the mirror or me\u2026 I saw it in a mirror, but it wasn't there when I turned around. At first I thought it was just a shadow, especially when it wasn't there when I turned. But I saw it so clearly in the mirror. And once it extended its long arm toward me I screamed and ran. I'm sure you remember that, since you accused me of ruining your anniversary. You made sure I imagined it and made me forget.\n\nIt didn't really work. I saw it again when I was 13 at Mary Alice's party. Mary Alice was putting some makeup on me and she told me to look myself up in the mirror. I saw it more clearly this time as it was quite close. It was tall, at least 6 feet. It had three eyes on its face, but its face was not arranged like ours. Lips were on top of the face, it had no nose and where a nose should be it had one big eye. Two smaller eyes were on the bottom of the face. Body was shadowy, not defined but I caught a glimpse of its several arms. It had no legs, only a shadowy bottom that floated above ground. I couldn't scream or talk, I was petrified. But I did close my eyes and that's when it moved closer. As soon as I opened them again it stood right behind me, hands outstretched wanting to touch me. I screamed and ran out of the house, wanting to go home. You gave me quite a lecture on manners and how to not embarrass your family\u2026\n\nI learned quickly how to deal with it, seeing it more frequently in my teenage years. I had to look at it while slowly backing away from the mirror. Every time I saw it, it looked more defined, bigger, taller and it had more eyes. It had eyes on its hands, its chest\u2026 always staring at me.\n\nIt first hurt me in my 21st year. I was house sitting for your friend and when I saw it I had enough. I stared at it and slowly blinked. With every blink it was closer and closer until it stood right behind me. I asked what it wanted and why it was haunting me, but it didn't answer. When it stood right behind me, its outstretched arm just inches away from my shoulder, I turned around. Just like that it was gone. Or so I thought. I turned toward the mirror again and the thing was touching my chest, right between my breasts. At first nothing happened but then I felt the most intensive pain of my life. It was as if I got sliced by a knife and it was going straight for my heart. I passed out. When I woke up I was lying in my own blood from three scratches that were shallow but long and stretched from my collarbone to my belly button.\n\nAfter that it got braver and more aggressive. It was as if my blood gave it more sustenance. I started seeing it in every mirror and every reflection. I tried so hard to avoid it but I was just not careful enough. It started to catch me almost every week and I didn't know what else to do. That was when you noticed my wounds mom. You accused me of being depressed, of cutting myself and once again gave me the lecture that I have no business being depressed. You took me to that doctor trying to convince him that I was crazy and needed to be institutionalized.\n\nThey had no mirrors there that I could have seen and I was released soon after. Of course, I wasn't cutting myself\u2026 it was never me. Not that you would ever believe me.\n\nIt is standing behind me now. I'm so tired. I'm tired of living in fear, I'm tired of running and I'm tired of you, dear mom and dad. I'm sorry because once you find me all cut out you will finally realize that I was not crazy and something did this to me and it was not me harming myself. I'm sorry you will never get a chance to apologize for making my life miserable.\n\nI'm done. I can see it now. It has grown so big and scary. More than eight feet now, with so many hands and eyes. I knew this would be my last time as it won't let me go. Luckily I had my phone with me so I can write this last letter to you two.\n\nGoodbye mom and dad. I'm sorry. It wasn't your fault. But neither was it mine.\n\nYour daughter","40":"[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qolzd7\/lesters_game\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qq1lhn\/lesters_game_part_2\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n\"Perhaps you've heard of my mother before?\" There was a little flicker of emotion in Lester's eye's as he brought her up. It was, unexpected. Up to this point, I hadn't considered the man to be much more than the thing I've had to accept I myself had become. \"Her name was Anna Sprengel, she was a rightful born countess of...\"\n\n\"Holy shit your name is Lester Sprengel!?\" I chuckled.\n\nHe frowned, maybe wondering if I was trying to get him to talk more or just dicking with him.\n\n\"Lester Westcott.\" He corrected me.\n\n\"Eh, not as funny but, I can see it.\" I scribbled something down and turned the attention back to his mother. He seemed like he wanted to open up about something there. \"So... mom... she was a countess of where?\"\n\n\"Landsfeldt. Though sadly she never was granted that title\"\n\n\"... where?\"\n\n\"Bavaria.\" He replied, now with a touch of sorrow in his eyes. \"My grandfather had been its reigning king but was forced to step down. My mother was...\"\n\n\"Wait. Where!?\"\n\n\"Bavaria.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Germany.\"\n\n\"Ahhhh, Gotcha! So grandaddy was a king but then democracy happened and they kicked yall to the curb, yadda yadda ya. What about Daddy Westcott?\"\n\nLester remained quiet. I looked up from my notes to see him scowling.\n\n\"I will not speak of my father so long as I have a choice.\"\n\n*Daddy Issues.* I wrote down.\n\n\"I want you to know Sawyer... It was never anything personal.\"\n\nI looked back up.\n\n\"Whatcha talking about?\"\n\nHe sighed. \"I don't seek people out, Sawyer. They come to me, just like you have, just like your friend did. I hear them out. I set the rules. And if they agree, well, then the rest is up to them. I'm not here to prey on people Sawyer...\"\n\nI was starting to dislike this.\n\n\"I just... I offer a possible solution to a problem, in exchange for...\"\n\n\"In exchange for the possibility you get to kill then, and who the fuck knows what else.\" I interrupted. \"I mean hey, you've never exactly explained the consequences of losing to me, but it's pretty fucking clear that there was shit in there that wanted me dead! I mean, I guess the question is, what would have happened to me if they got me, Lester! What the fuck, happened to Kelly after they got her.\"\n\nLester looked down, he was feeling guilty about something, I could fucking smell it.\n\n\"Did you even tell her what she was agreeing to? Lester!?\" I felt a wicked smile come over my face. Lester turned to meet my gaze, but he said nothing.\n\n\"Or was that the whole fucking point!? Never let the winners say any details, just let them spread the word. Get em to show off those fancy treasures like throwing chum in the water! So let me guess. Kelly didn't even know what she got into until she was already neck-deep in your filth. So tell me, Lester! Where is she!?\"\n\n\"She serves my associates now...\" Lester muttered.\n\n\"... Who!?\"\n\nHe let out another sigh. \"Aghh, you may know soon enough. It's time for the last game.\" He nodded to the wall behind me.\n\nThe wall was yet again. But I saw nothing on the other end. No stone corridor, No sprawling woods, nothing, just an empty Void.\n\n\"Sawyer.\" Lester was suddenly behind me again, resting a palm on my shoulder, eww. \"I don't believe there much I can say to convince you, but I urge you, It's not too late to turn this one down. I...\"\n\n\"Holy shit you're actually afraid I'm Going to WIN aren't you!\"\n\nHis eye's narrowed. \"No, I think no matter the outcome, there is no winning from this game. I was quite a bit like you once Sawyer, arrogant, angry, b...\"\n\n\"OH JESUS FUCKING CHRIST! JUST TELL ME THE FUCKING RULES!!!!\"\n\nHe stared at me with what looked like a mix of annoyance and disappointment. With a sigh, he pulled out a small satchel of something and handed it to me.\n\n\"There's no safety net this time.\" He muttered. \"But this will help you if you need it. It's salt, you can use it to make a barrier, or injure anything out of the ordinary, use it sparingly.\"\n\n\"Cool, so what's the goal. Let me guess I'm looking for the way out.\"\n\n\"No\", he replied. \"You'll need to perform a ritual to escape.\" He handed me an envelope that seemed to have manifested in his hand. \"The instructions, as well as the materials you need. You will need to find these items before you can begin.\"\n\nI took the envelope. \"Interesting,\" I muttered.\n\n\"There's, also a few things you should avoid.\" Lester continued. \"I'm sure you know by now to avoid anything out of the ordinary. This time though, I'll warn you there may be signs of danger ahead. The color red, the smell of sulfur, even just a bad feeling. They can all be Tells.\"\n\nLester let out another sigh, he seemed to do that a lot.\n\n\"I didn't choose this game, Sawyer... It seems some of my associates have taken an interest in you. Hence why I tried to warn you before. This will be the most dangerous game.\"\n\nI put on my best smile. \"Well Lester, your buddies ain't ever met a motherfucker like me!\"\n\nLester groaned but I carried on.\n\n\"BURN DOWN THE FORREST! SET THE BOOGYMAN ON FIRE! ME LUCKY LUCKY YOU SUCKY SUCK-\"\n\n\"OH JUST FUCKING GO!\" He cried out giving me a shove through the door.\n\n\\-\n\nGoddamnt it, Lester... Every god damn time...\n\nI let out a groan and lifted myself to my feet. I was standing on... carpet? I looked around. I was standing in another room, not unlike the one id been in with Lester. No table, or really much furniture. Though there was this odd little stone pedestal in the center of the room. There were also a lot of doors, doors everywhere in fact, and one window. I approached it, looking out to see... nothing.\n\n\"Beautiful,\" I muttered to myself. Taking out Lester's envelope and opening it to see what exactly my aim here was.\n\n*Items required.*\n\nCeremonial *Dagger.*\n\n*5 candles*\n\n*A compass*\n\n..... A goat?\n\nI quickly skimmed the instructions. Jesus christ he actually wants me to sacrifice a motherfucker...\n\nI tossed the instructions in my pocket and turned my attention to the doors. They took up nearly all the space of the surrounding walls. Rainbow of different colors. A few red ones among the bunch stood out to me.\n\nWelp! Fuck what Lester said! I'm Sawyer the fucking Sadist Bitch! I can take anything! Lester ain't getting in my bloody way!\n\nI strolled up to the nearest red door and swung er open!\n\n***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!***\n\nIn was like the frame itself started screaming at me so god damn loud I actually felt the hair flying back from my face!\n\nI slammed the door shut! NOPE! Big Nope! Maybe listen to Lester.\n\nI found a nice blue door and opened that. No screaming this time, but I couldn't see anything. It was like looking out the window. hmmm.\n\nI opened all the doors, same deal, every single one just lead into a void. No way of telling where I was going.\n\nI walked back to my blue door. Poked my finger into it. It didn't disappear as I'd expected. I watched it go forward into whatever this was.\n\nOkay...\n\nI took a deep breath and Jumped!\n\n\\-\n\nThe first thing I felt was raindrops. Then a person bumped into me like a dumbass. He turned to me, said something in a language I didn't understand. Then walked off into the crowd... I was in a crowd?\n\nHundreds of people were around me. All moving towards something. I was in a town of some sort. Nowhere I recognize but that figured. Then I saw her.\n\nIn the midst of the crowd, A woman was tied to a post. Lots and lots and tinder at her feet.\n\nI approached along with the crowd. This man, in what looked to be a pasters outfit, was yelling something. Again I couldn't understand a word, he seemed pretty into whatever it was though. Then, he said something I did recognize. A name.\n\n*\"Anna Sprengel,\"* The man said in a thick accent. I turned to look at her, crying, pleading on that post.\n\nSo, Lester, Mommy was a witch.\n\nThe man gestured several items to these items that had been displayed out to us observers. Evidence I guess. There was some book, a few weird herbs, what looked like somebody's heart, and.... a dagger... huh.\n\nI looked up at the man shouting, and back to my prize. I couldn't just swipe it in front of all these people. unless...\n\nI glanced around quickly, took me a while before I saw it, but there it was. A pit behind Anna, on the side of a building, was a blue door, the same id came in from.\n\n\"Okay! SCEWS ME! PARDON ME! MOVE IT TUBBY!\" I shoved my way through the crowd and towards that dagger. When I broke through and approached the table, the priest or whatever he was stopped talking, he looked a little shocked for a moment. Once I grabbed the knife though he quickly jumped up and started yelling at me.\n\nI smiled.\n\n\"POCKET SALT MOTHERFUCKER!!!\" I yelled, throwing a big ol handful in his face!\n\nHe wrenched back, got a bit in his eye I think, meanwhile I snickered and made a run for it.\n\nThe crowd turned fucking rabid. It's moments like this where I wonder if maybe I should think these things through a bit more. Moments where my humourous chuckles quickly turn to cries of fear and panic where I think, maybe there was a smarter way.\n\nAnyway, I ran like a bitch for the door and just managed to hop through before one of those feral peasants grabbed me.\n\nI took a nice big sigh of relief back in the room. Turned around, unzipped my pants and released my bladder back into that void. It had been a while.\n\n\"you shouda...\"\n\nI froze. Did someone just say something?\n\n\"you shou... you shoulda...\" I peered over my shoulder and Jumped! There was a fucking man in the room with me. He was knelt on the floor, covered by a burgundy hooded robe.\n\n\"you shoul... you shhh...\"\n\nI slowly zipped up my pants. Turned around. Was he, talking to me?\n\n\"Hello?\" I said, doing my best not to stutter.\n\n\"You you yooooo you you...\"\n\nJesus christ what was up with this motherfucker.\n\nI walked towards him, vary cautiously, he looked meek but, something about him felt off, very fucking off.\n\n\"you you shhhhhhh... You should... You shouda... You should of....\"\n\n\"Should have what?\" I asked, a slight chill running down my neck.\n\nAnd then he looked up! Bald as the sun he was! Pale as the fucking snow! He had no eyelids, just two big ol circles. No nose ethier, triangle hole there! And was grinning with the nastiest teeth I'd ever seen.\n\nThen he shouted.\n\n\"YA SHOULDNT HAVE LEFT ALL THE DOOOOOORS OPEN DICKHEAD!!!!\"","41":"My wife Florence likes to bake lemon-flavored cupcakes. Sometimes I wake up in the early hours of the morning and she\u2019s already put an entire tray of them in the oven. She makes the icing herself; also lemon-flavored, and sometimes she adds poppy seeds to the batter. Our daughter Samantha says they look like little ants, our son Justin doesn\u2019t like lemons.\n\nWe bought our house five months ago. It\u2019s a beautiful two-story house with a large lawn and a garden in the back along with a brand new swimming pool. We bought an apple tree for the front yard and made a path of large stones that leads up to our front door.\n\nDuring our first month at the new house, Samantha said she found a stray cat and asked if we could keep it. After some back and forth, my wife and I decided to let her keep the cat, as long as she agreed to take care of it.\n\nI didn\u2019t see the cat for a while, and Samantha said he was shy and spent most of his time hiding in the bushes in the backyard.\n\nOne Sunday morning I slept in rather late, which was unusual for me, and found the house still and quiet. I made my way downstairs, following the mild scent of lemon into the kitchen where Florence and our kids were sitting on the floor, the cat in the middle.\n\n\u201cMom\u2019s awake,\u201d Justin said as he looked up and saw me.\n\nMy wife and Samantha turned to look at me.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d I greeted them.\n\nThey gave me tight smiles that didn\u2019t reach their eyes and then looked away quickly. I glanced down at the black cat that was sitting on our kitchen floor and watched it as it turned its head to look at me.\n\nThat\u2019s when I noticed that it had four eyes. My breath caught in my throat as all four of the cat\u2019s eyes blinked at me. Then, the cat ran out the back door.\n\nSamantha stood and shut the door as my wife and Justin stood up.\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThat was Toby,\u201d Florence replied.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Justin asked.\n\n\u201cHis eyes\u2026\u201d I replied.\n\nThey all looked at each other, exchanging looks but they didn\u2019t answer.\n\nI attempted to press them for answers a few times, and they pretended like they didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. I didn\u2019t see Toby again.\n\nTwo months in, I walked into Justin\u2019s room and found him sitting on his bed talking to what I thought was a friend of his. Justin\u2019s eyes widened as he saw me come in, but his friend didn\u2019t even flinch. He continued to sit with his back to me as if I weren\u2019t even there.\n\n\u201cSorry to interrupt, I just came to ask what you wanted to eat for dinner today.\u201d\n\nJustin glanced from his friend to me, anxiously. I felt like I had walked in on something awkward.\n\n\u201cCan we have mashed potatoes?\u201d Justin asked.\n\n\u201cYeah sure,\u201d I replied. \u201cIs your friend staying?\u201d\n\nJustin bit his lower lip and I waited as his friend slowly turned around to look at me. I was once again caught off guard and I gasped as my heart began to pound against my chest.\n\nI watched as the boy on Justin\u2019s bed turned his head all the way around without moving his body. But that wasn\u2019t the strangest part. His facial features were sideways. His eyes were on the left side of his face, his nose in the center only it was turned horizontally, and his mouth was over by the right side. His ears were placed normally.\n\nI stood in the hallway just outside Justin\u2019s room as the boy stood up. That was when I noticed that all of his body parts were messed up. His left arm was about a foot longer than his right, and one of his legs was backward.\n\n\u201cSorry!\u201d I stuttered, slamming the door shut as my palms began to sweat.\n\nI ran outside to take deep breaths, but then I remembered that fucking cat, and I ran back inside and locked myself in my home office instead. I stayed in there for a while, until Samantha knocked on the door and told me that my wife had made dinner and they were waiting for me to join them.\n\nI slowly followed her to the kitchen and we ate in silence.\n\nI didn\u2019t ask about Justin\u2019s friend. I think this is where I messed up.\n\nThree months in.\n\nIt was my and Florence\u2019s anniversary. The kids were at her parent's house and we were going to have a romantic night in. We cooked an elaborate dinner and then got into the pool. The night was still and warm, the water softly illuminated by the floating lights that Florence had purchased and the soft yellow fairy lights we had strung up.\n\nI had brought our most expensive bottle of wine out with us and we sat on the steps of the pool, sipping wine as we stared at the water in front of us.\n\nI had maybe one glass of wine when I decided to lay back in the water and relax. As I stared up at the lights and the stars above me, I began to hear a soft clicking noise under the water. I concentrated, trying to figure out what the cause of the noise was. The more I listened the louder it got, until I stood up, lifting my head out of the water.\n\n\u201cDo you hear that?\u201d I asked.\n\nFlorence looked around the yard. \u201cHear what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat clicking noise.\u201d\n\nFlorence sat in silence for a few seconds, listening. But I couldn\u2019t hear it anymore. She shook her head and I shrugged it off, laying back on the water.\n\nAfter a few seconds, the clicking started up again. This time, I stood up and looked down into the water.\n\nI could see a dark shape slither around the bottom of the pool. I squinted but was unable to make it out. I took a deep breath and plunged my head into the water, opening my eyes and ignoring the sting from the chlorinated water.\n\nI could see a bit clearer now, and I stared at the floor of the pool as the dark figure slithered around some more. It was some kind of lizard, a human-sized lizard, with dark blue scaly skin and long blonde hair. I watched, intrigued, as it pushed itself up through the bottom of the pool, looking up at me with its shiny green eyes. It reached out to me and touched the center of my forehead with one of its rough fingers.\n\nImmediately, a sharp pain radiated through my skull and I realized how much my lungs were burning from the lack of oxygen. I lifted my head out of the water and gasped as I tried to breathe. The pain in my head grew until I was unable to see or hear anything.\n\nI woke up on the couch, wet and cold as Florence stood above me.\n\n\u201cLouise? Are you alright?\u201d She asked.\n\nI sat up and noticed that the pain was gone. \u201cYeah, I must have gotten a migraine or something,\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cI made you some chamomile tea,\u201d Florence said, holding out a steaming mug.\n\nI took it from her and took a sip. She had put a lemon slice in it, and I winced as the bitten taste filled my mouth.\n\n\u201cYou should lay back down, just in case,\u201d she said when I finished the tea.\n\nI agreed and shut my eyes.\n\nWhen I awoke it was nighttime. I was disoriented as I sat up, almost falling off the couch as I forgot where I was. I slowly stood up, stretching out my limbs and back.\n\nI made my way towards the stairs in the dark, careful not to trip and fall. I figured Florence had gone to bed and decided to join her.\n\nI stopped at the bottom of the staircase as I turned and noticed that the back door was wide open. I walked over and closed it, sliding the lock into place. Then, I made my way upstairs and towards our bedroom.\n\nAs I reached the door, the pain in my head came back and I tried to ignore it as I pushed the door open, ready to get into bed. However, I froze in my tracks as I looked into our bedroom.\n\nThe entire room glowed a soft green color, although I wasn\u2019t able to tell where the light was coming from. I stood there, confused, as my eyes scanned the room, eventually landing on our bed.\n\nFlorence was there, but so was that thing. The thing from the pool. It laid on its back in my bed, its dark scaly skin shimmering in the dark. It didn\u2019t seem to notice me as it was focused on my wife, who sat on top of it, naked, grinding her hips into its lower half.\n\nI stood there, in shock, as Florence continued to move her hips in a circle, then stopping and moving them back and forth. I couldn\u2019t make a single sound as I watched, my vision slightly blurring as the pain in my forehead increased.\n\nAfter a few minutes of listening to nothing but my wife\u2019s heavy breathing. Suddenly, the thing turned its head to look at me, its bright glowing eyes boring into my soul. I continued to watch as it lifted its long scaly fingers and dragged them down Florence\u2019s back, peeling the skin off wherever it got caught on its rough fingers, drawing blood.\n\nFlorence didn\u2019t seem to notice or care as she continued to grind her hips into it. The pain in my head got stronger as my ears began to ring. It knocked me down to my knees and once again rid me of my sight.\n\nWhen I awoke, it was morning and I was laying in bed as if nothing had happened.\n\n\u201cFlorence?\u201d I called.\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d She walked out of the bathroom, her hair dripping wet.\n\n\u201cI had a really weird dream. How did I get up here\u201d\n\n\u201cUm, you walked?\u201d\n\nI watched as she walked towards our closet, focusing on her bare back, but there was no sign of that thing having scratched her. Perhaps I had imagined it?\n\n\u201cWhat happened after the pool?\u201d I asked.\n\nFlorence grabbed a shirt and pulled it over her head. \u201cYou passed out so I carried you to the couch where you fell asleep. I didn\u2019t want to bother you so I left you there but you must have made it up here sometime during the night because you were here when I woke up.\u201d\n\nI said nothing, choosing to believe that what I had seen last night had been a nightmare. A really fucked up nightmare.\n\nDuring the fourth month, it was Justin and Samantha\u2019s birthday. They had invited their entire class, and Florence and I spent most of the morning making her lemon cupcakes as well as some chocolate ones for Justin.\n\nI finally sat down as the kids ate their pizza. I couldn\u2019t help but stare at the pool, remembering the thing I had seen in there. I hadn\u2019t gone swimming since that day and Florence didn\u2019t really seem to notice or care.\n\nOnce all the children had gone home, Florence and I cleaned up the backyard while Justin and Samantha got ready for bed.\n\nI saw the first black moth when I walked back into the kitchen. It had landed on the kitchen window next to the fridge. I walked over and opened the window, slowly leading the moth towards the opening until I flew back out into the night.\n\nI shut the window and walked upstairs and into the bathroom where Samantha was brushing her teeth.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Justin?\u201d I asked her.\n\nI walked over to the shower to pull the curtain closed when I noticed the second black moth, sitting on the faucet. I looked around for something to grab it with so I could take it outside but found nothing.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s putting on his pj's,\u201d Samantha said.\n\nI walked back to the kitchen and grabbed a cup and an old envelope. I walked to the bathroom again to find the moth on the mirror as Samantha stared at it. I put the cup over the moth, then slid the envelope underneath it. Once I had a hold of it, I carried it downstairs and released it outside.\n\nI went back into the house as Florence was putting away some of the leftover cupcakes. Once she was done, we both went upstairs and put the kids to bed.\n\nI decided to shower before bed, and turned the water on as I undressed. I stepped into the steamy shower and proceeded to wash my hair. I shut my eyes as I rinsed the shampoo out, then turned around to rinse my face before opening them again.\n\nAs I did, a sudden movement on the tiled shower floor caught my attention and I looked down to see yet another black moth, struggling to fly as it jumped around in the water. I grabbed it with the handle of my loofah and set it on the closed toilet lid as I continued with my shower.\n\nA few minutes later, as I turned off the water I noticed the fourth moth. This one was on top of my shampoo bottle. I was a bit annoyed now, so I ignored it as I stepped out of the shower. The moth I had gotten out earlier had died. I grabbed some toilet paper and threw it into the garbage as I got dressed and walked back into the bedroom where Florence was already asleep.\n\nI laid next to her and closed my eyes. As I was drifting off to sleep, I began to feel a fluttering on my eyelids. I frantically shook my head as I ran my hands over my face before opening my eyes.\n\nI looked around the dark room, feeling more fluttering on my arm. I yelped as I swatted the area, and reached over and turned on the lamp on the bedside table.\n\nI looked down and noticed that Florence was covered in black moths. They were in the sheets, on the headboard, and on the pillows, completely covering her and the blankets. I jumped out of bed, grabbing a corner of the sheet and flapping it up and down wildly, trying to get all the moths to fly away, but they didn\u2019t move.\n\nI watched as they all began to flutter their wings, as if in unison. They continued for a few seconds before they stopped moving. They all seemed to fall over, as if dead, and then they vanished in a cloud of black smoke. Florence was gone as well, and I began to freak out. I ran out of the room, but tripped over the rug in the hallway and fell down the stairs.\n\nI must have hit my head because I woke up back in my bed, without any memory as to how I got there. It was still nighttime and Florence was sound asleep beside me.\n\nI once again convinced myself that it had all been a nightmare, and went back to sleep.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here for five months.\n\nThis morning when I went downstairs, Florence, Justin, and Samantha were nowhere to be found. The house smelled like lemon, but it was empty and there was no evidence that Florence had baked.\n\nI walked into every single room of the house, and then eventually into the backyard where I found them laying in the pool on their backs as they stared up at the morning sky.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I called as I made my way over to the pool.\n\nNone of them said anything and I walked over to the left side, where Florence was.\n\nI walked over until I was basically standing above her. As I got a look at her, I screamed. Her face was still, staring up at the sky. The whites of her eyes were dark red, and her face had been split down the middle. It was still bleeding, the skin drooping off towards her temples.\n\nI could see her teeth through the wound, which stopped right under her lips. As I screamed, I noticed her eyes roll around sporadically until they landed on me.\n\nI backed away from her, but that\u2019s when I got a look at Justin and Samantha. Both of their faces had been frozen in fear, mid-scream. I backed away from the pool, making my way towards the house as Florence stood up, pushing herself out of the water. When she stood, her skin sagged downwards, exposing more of the muscles underneath.\n\nSamantha and Justin followed, and they began to make their way towards me. I slammed the kitchen door shut and locked it. As I looked up again, I saw that familiar scaly creature rise from the water after them.\n\nI ran into the living room tripping over something. When the startled screech rang through the house, I realized I had tripped over the cat, who was now sitting atop the coffee table, staring at me with all four of its eyes.\n\nI grabbed my car keys as the kitchen door flew open, slamming against the wall, and yanked open the front door. I ran down the driveway, unlocking the car door and falling into it. As I started the engine I looked up into the rearview mirror and noticed the boy I had seen in Justin\u2019s room, standing behind my car.\n\nI looked towards the door, where Florence, our kids, and that thing were coming after me.\n\nI closed my eyes as I stepped on the gas, reversing down the driveway and running over the boy. Once I was on the street I frantically turned the wheel and shifted into drive, taking off away from the house.\n\nAs I looked back one last time, I watched millions of moths land on the house as Florence and that thing began to retreat back into the house. The boy still lay in the driveway where I had hit him, still, dead. And my kids stared as I drove off, their faces still frozen mid-scream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[X](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Odd_directions\/)","42":"*\u201cA manifestation of imagination that provokes an emotional response, or an appreciation for beauty.\u201d*\n\n\nThat is an over-simplified definition of art. For me, art is what happens when I connect a few lines in a zen-like state. It gives me a place to be outside of my anxiety\u2014 outside of my thoughts. \n\n\nSometimes, I feel as if my mind is trying to cannibalize itself. Every day it sends hordes of intrusive thoughts, trying desperately to claw away at the inside of my skull. To me, anxiety feels like I\u2019m drowning in an electric ocean. It\u2019s a tingling, suffocating sensation, and every time I try to resurface for air, I pull myself back down into the darkness.\n\n\nIt\u2019s only when I put pen to paper that I feel like I can finally tread water. I can finally breathe. I remember frantically sketching when my parents died; gasping for air with each stoke of my pen. Therapy seems to only bloom for me through art.\n\n\nWhen I get a compliment for my drawings, a warmth in my chest burns away the anxiety. Admiration for my talent was one of the only kindnesses my parents would award me. I never officially came out to them as a lesbian, but I could sense the resentment fester behind their eyes.\n\n\nGay or straight, when I finished a drawing, my parents shared with me the same warmth in their chests. Pride.\n\n\nAside from the pride, we also shared an unrelenting disdain for me. Naturally, it\u2019s hard to date someone when you have self-deprecating thoughts biting, and snapping at the back of your head. \n\n\n*I\u2019m not good enough. I\u2019m just a burden on everyone around me. The closer someone gets to me, the less they\u2019ll love me. If I could, I would abandon me, too.*\n\n\nThese thoughts ring through my head like endlessly chiming church bells. It wasn\u2019t until I met Becca that I learned even though those thoughts will always ring in my mind, they don\u2019t have to be deafening.\n\n\nGrowing up, I had a painful, burning feeling in my stomach whenever I was around my parents. When I was with Becca, however, there was no burning, only butterflies. At first I was uncomfortable dating a girl, I felt like I could feel my mom, and dad\u2019s stare pierce through me from the afterlife. It didn\u2019t matter, though, Becca\u2019s arms wrapped around me was the only armor I needed.\n\n\nThings were going great for awhile, until Becca told me that I had to meet her parents. She told me it wasn\u2019t a big deal, but her parents had a weird process for meeting her significant others. I was overflowing with anxiety, but for Becca, I managed to put on a brave face.\n\n\nWhen I first entered their home, I immediately took note of how immaculate everything was. I felt like even breathing was making their house somehow dirtier. \n\n\n\u201cHey, Jenna, come on in. I\u2019m Henry.\u201d Her father, a slender, sophisticated-looking man, said. He reached his hand out for a hand shake, and I loosely grabbed it. \u201cHmm\u201d he quickly pondered to himself. Becca\u2019s mother, a beautiful, older woman waved with a friendly \u201chello, I\u2019m Francine.\u201d I returned the wave, and looked toward Becca. She was taking off her shoes, to which I quickly followed suit.\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just about to start dinner, do you have any dietary restrictions, or anything?\u201d Her father asked. I shook my head an softly said \u201cno, thank you.\u201d Francine looked me up, and down, cocked an eyebrow, and said \u201cokay.\u201d\n\n\nMy cheeks were burning. Francine obviously thought I was fat, or something. I wanted to sprint away then, and there, but I felt Becca\u2019s fingers gently trace around my back, and regained my strength.\n\n\nAt the dinner table, we were greeted by a sprawling feast. A whole turkey, dinner rolls, green beans, creamed corn, mashed potatoes, salad, and beans were all meticulously placed in a stunning display. \n\n\nAs we sat down, I reached for the mashed potatoes, but stopped when I heard Henry loudly clear his throat. Becca grabbed my hand, then grabbed her dad\u2019s hand. I looked over to Francine and saw her reaching out to me. I grabbed her hand, and was about to bow my head in prayer, but Henry\u2019s unrelenting, frustrated eyes prevented me from doing so. I could feel my stomach begin to burn.\n\n\n\u201cBless us, O Lord, we give thanks for the meal you\u2019ve provided for us, today. Thank you for Francine, and her amazing culinary expertise. Thank you for blessing Rebecca with admittance to the college of her choice, and thank you for having Rebecca bring her friend to our dinner table, today. Amen.\u201d Henry finished Grace without breaking his stare.\n\n\nWe all echoed \u201camen\u201d in unison, and began to fill our plates with the food in front of us. As I ate, a word rattled around in my head: \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\n\n*Friend? Is that what her parents think we are? Friends? Do they know that I might be in love with their daughter? Did Becca tell them? Is she ashamed of me?* \n\n\nMy stomach continued to burn as these thoughts raced through my mind. \u201cGo ahead, Jenna, don\u2019t be shy.\u201d Henry said, flatly. I ate a little bit of everything. There was no conversation at the table, only the sound of silverware clinking against plates. Silence makes me uncomfortable. Nervously, I tried to make conversation. \u201cSo, Henry, do\u2014\u201c \n\n\nJust as I was about to ask Henry a question, Francine cut me off. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, dear, we\u2019ll have plenty of time to get to know each other, later.\u201d\n\n\nBurning cheeks. Burning stomach. I felt so uneasy, so uncomfortable. I finished my plate, and added more food. I needed to fidget with something\u2014 I needed to draw. I brought my sketchbook and a pen, but I felt it would be rude to draw at the dinner table, so I ate, instead.\n\n\nOnce we were done with dinner, Francine began moving trays of food from the table to the kitchen. I stood up to help, but Henry motioned for me to sit back down. After all of the food had been removed, Francine, Henry, and Becca all sat on the other side of the table, across from me.\n\n\nThey all sat quietly with their eyes fixed on me. The silence was cold, and empty. I nervously dug at my cuticles as my stomach burned.\n\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m sure Becca told you how we\u2019re a bit unorthodox when it comes to meeting someone interested in dating our daughter.\u201d Henry said, cutting through the silence so abruptly that I nearly flinched. I nodded, and softly said \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe call this \u2018Judgement Day,\u2019 which may sound scarier than what it really is. Basically, we\u2019re going to review you from the moment you walked through the front door until now.\u201d Francine said as she brushed a lock of her golden hair to the side.\n\n\nI felt like I was sinking\u2014 no, plummeting deeper into the electric ocean. My eyes already felt hot with tears. My eyes fled to Becca\u2019s for refuge, but all I found was an uninviting stoicism.\n\n\nHenry licked his lips, laced his fingers, and said, \u201cFirst off, your handshake was very limp. I could already tell you lack any confidence.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cGood call taking off your shoes, though. I mean, you had to look to Becca before you did, but you still managed to get that right.\u201d Francine added. Becca nodded with every word they said. What bothered me more than what they were saying, was how matter-of-fact their tone of voices were.\n\n\nHenry leaned forward, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you believe in God, or not, it\u2019s always good practice to wait for your hosts to tell you it\u2019s okay to eat before you start grabbing food. I mean, some houses still say Grace. Not waiting really just makes you look rude, and overly eager to eat.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201c I tried explaining myself, but Francine cut me off, yet again.\n\n\n\u201cSpeaking of overly eager to eat\u2026 two plates? Really? I\u2019m sorry, dear, but I think you honestly could have made do with half a plate.\u201d Again, Francine\u2019s tone was almost clinical. \n\n\nThe burn in my stomach intensified, like I had swallowed a plate of hot coals. I wrapped my arms around my stomach and hunched forward. \n\n\n*Maybe if they see I\u2019m in pain they\u2019ll stop? Maybe they\u2019ll be concerned for me and show they really do care? Maybe this can end. Besides, these are things you say to yourself all the time. You already know this. You already know this. You already know this. Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t cry. You already know this. They\u2019ll stop when they see you\u2019re in pain. Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t cry. Don\u2019t cry.*\n\n\nThese thoughts devolved, and became a sacred mantra to me. Repeating these words was equally the most important thing I could for myself, and entirely useless. My cuticles stung from how raw I\u2019ve picked them. \n\n\nHenry extended an open hand to Becca. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for the online portion, unless you have anything else to add, sweetie?\u201d Becca shook her head as she handed him her phone, \u201cNo, you both pretty much hit on everything that I was thinking.\u201d\n\n\n*What do you mean \u201ceverything that you were thinking?\u201d What do you\u2014* \n\n\nMy thoughts were immediately extinguished by what Henry had said next.\n\n\n\u201cBecca said you sent her some nude selfies?\u201d Henry said, swiping through her gallery. My abdomen was a forest fire, burning me from the inside out. The burn slowly crept up my throat, and sizzled the back of my tongue with acid. My cheeks were so hot that they had almost gone completely numb.\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, let\u2019s see, hmm. Ah, stretch marks, you were right, Francine. Look, she trying to hide them with the camera angle.\u201d Henry, and Francine both huddled around Becca\u2019s phone, pointing out every flaw I have, almost to a molecular level.\n\n\n\u201cAnd her breasts are noticeably different sizes. Nipples are also quite large. Our Becca really isn\u2019t shallow, is she?\u201d Francine said with a flat pride in her voice.\n\n\n\u201cClearly not, but I\u2019m worried about her being with someone who would send nude selfies. I mean, no respect for herself, at all.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIt *is* a bit trashy, I agree, dear, but this is how girls her age court each other. Usually, the girl sending nudes would want to choose more flattering angles, but Jenna went with a different approach.\u201d\n\n\nI buried my face into my hands. I couldn\u2019t hold back my tears any longer. I should just run away, but my legs were jelly. Useless, and weak. Useless, and weak. Useless, and weak. *I\u2019m useless, and weak.* \n\n\nWith Becca\u2019s phone still in hand, Henry said, \u201cNext up, we have your social media to look through. Dang, I can\u2019t find the\u2014\u201c\n\n\nBecca leaned over to Henry. \u201cIt\u2019s right here, dad.\u201d She said, clicking on the app icon.\n\n\n\u201cAh, thank you, sweetie. Looks like you mainly post your art on here. Rebecca says you\u2019re going to go to school for art?\u201d \n\n\nI nodded as I cradled my head in my hands.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 kind of good. It\u2019s not impressive, really.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNo, not really, my dear. I just don\u2019t see you having a successful career drawing like\u2026 this. There\u2019s no substance, the shapes and proportions are just all wrong. Just pathetic, really.\u201d Francine said.\n\n\nThose words pierced through my heart sharper than any blade ever could.\n\n\n*Not impressive. Not good. Not good. Not good. I\u2019m not good. Not impressive. I have nothing. I have no merit. No redeeming qualities. Nothing. Not good.* \n\n\nThe searing acid began to pool in my mouth. My chest was on fire. I quickly stood up, and tried to run to the bathroom, but my weak legs collapsed me to the ground. As I landed, I began to uncontrollably vomit blackness onto their white carpet. The more the inky vomit leaked from my mouth, the less my stomach burned.\n\n\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me!?\u201d I heard Henry yell.\n\n\nI rolled away from the black puddle, and onto my side. \n\n\n\u201cMaybe if you didn\u2019t eat so much goddamned food\u2014\u201c Francine was beginning to howl, until she saw the dark pool begin to bubble.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Becca arbitrarily asked.\n\n\n\u201cYou guys want to see the absolute worst thing about me?\u201d I asked, as the black puddle rose from the ground, like a wax candle melting in reverse. Eventually, the black liquid adopted a noticeably human-like shape. They all stood motionless. Speechless, as the inky substance sculpted itself in a familiar image. In my image.\n\n\nI felt my eyes roll in the back of my head. My sight shifted from the floor, to standing on two, inky legs. My new body acted against my will.\n\n\n*No! Please! No! Run! Please! Oh, God, please run!* \n\n\nI could only watch as a liquid black arm jutted out towards Francine\u2019s head, and plunged two fingers deep into her eyes. Smoke hissed from her eye sockets, and she collapsed to the ground, dead. \n\n\n*Stop! No! Please! No! Fuck!*\n\n\nHenry tried fighting back, landing a strong front kick to the dark figure\u2019s chest. His foot slowly started to sink deeper into the ink. The same smoking hiss bellowed out from where his leg was trapped. He screamed in pain, and fought to retrieve his foot. He tugged at it, over, and over again, until he fell backwards with nothing but a badly burned stump.\n\n\nI tried closing my eyes to avoid this nightmare, but they were no longer mine to close. \n\n\nThe tar-like body I was seeing through stomped toward Becca with an unsettling deliberateness. I felt Henry\u2019s head cave in under the dark figure\u2019s heel, though, I luckily didn\u2019t see it. Becca cried, and begged to be spared. \n\n\n*Stop! Don\u2019t hurt her! Please don\u2019t hurt her! She\u2019s sorry! She\u2019s sorry! No, please!*\n\n\nMy inky fingers wrapped around Becca\u2019s throat. The now all-too-familiar hiss of smoke danced from where the dark hands clutched her neck. I was worried that I would have to watch her slowly die, that she would kick, and struggle less, and less. But, after a few minutes, her head rolled backwards, and off her shoulders, landing on the ground with a solid, meaty \u201cthud\u201d. \n\n\nI felt my new body begin to melt, slowly sinking back down to a puddle. \n\n\nWhen my sight returned to me\u2026 the real me, I saw the three lifeless bodies I had left behind while in my inky state. Sinking\u2014 plummeting. I gasped for air while I desperately fought this electric ocean.\n\n\n*I need to draw. I need to draw. Draw. Please, where is my sketch book? I need to draw. I need to draw.*\n\n\nWith trembling fingers I grabbed my sketchbook, and furiously drew. I sobbed. Hot tears fell down my face as I ripped pages from my sketchbook. It was just like my parents. I sketched like this when my parents died. When my parents died. When my parents were killed. I sketched like this when I killed\u2026","43":"It all started when I received letters sent to the wrong address. It had been going on for quite awhile. I would go out to get the mail, I would sort through it and make piles for each family member living with me, and then I would get to the last letter with a name I didn\u2019t recognize. The address it was supposed to go to was always somewhere located at the capital city in my state. I wasn\u2019t weirded out at the start, I simply didn\u2019t open the letter and wrote on the envelope \u201cNot at this address.\u201d\nThen, the letters got more frequent and I got impatient and curious. One Wednesday evening I went out to get the mail. It was dark because of daylight savings time. By the time I got inside of my house the lights hurt to look at, so I turned them off while I sifted through the mail. The first envelope was addressed to me, Marie. The second was addressed to my grandparents\u2014whom had been staying with me for quite some time. The third in the pile was to him. The mysterious unknown person. The name on the envelope read: Timothy Toderick. I thought about how uncommon a name that was for the area we lived in. I had finally had enough of not knowing what was in these letters. Which was another weird thing, there were no hints whatsoever of what this letter could be. No bank names, no lame \u201cwish you well\u201d stamps or kiss marks made with red lipstick. I got my fancy letter opener, it had chrome finish and saved me time on opening because of my short nails. The only thing in the envelope was a small index card, like the ones your grandma would put your favorite recipes on. It read:\n\nMy name is Toby. If you\u2019re seeing this it\u2019s probably because you found it in the mail. Maybe you live with lots of family members, maybe you live alone. Maybe you have a wife, a husband, a dog. Whatever you have, I guarantee you it will not last. \nWhy? Well, even I don\u2019t really know. I just know it happened to me. One day I opened the mail and received a letter from an undisclosed address, the name on it was Tiffany. I kept receiving them, like I\u2019m sure you are now. I opened one, I read the exact same thing you\u2019re reading now. Weeks later, when I finally forgot about the traumatizing letter I had received from Tiffany, my cat Sam died. Then, my goldfish Terry. Which doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, I can get a new cat, I can get a new goldfish. Then, possibly, worst of all, I found my girlfriend dead in her apartment the day I proposed to her. I wish I never opened that letter, please know that you will lose many people because of this mistake. \nYou may be asking, are there ways around this? Certainly. After months of research I\u2019ve found that there are four things you can do to slow the process and get your family somewhere safe:\n\n1. Lock all your doors\u2014it hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet that the people who are doing this are exactly human, but it never hurts.\n2. Take any salt you have, anywhere around the house. Sprinkle it on one window ceil in your living room, and then on the one in your kitchen. They love the taste of salt.\n3. Bite your lips until a drop of blood comes off. Spread that on a piece of paper and put it in your pocket. They love the smell of blood. \n4. Hide. \n\nGoodbye, Marie.","44":"Back in 2003, I used to receive some email chain containing many weird and old pictures that were supposed to show ghost. I've never seen that before so I was both scared and curiously attracted at the same time.\n\nI did a search on the web to find how to try to take some ghost pictures by myself and I found a blog that gave me some advices. So, one day, I decided to ask my stepfather to lend me a digital camera.\n\nIt was a Friday evening, we were in March or April. My friends and I used to hang out in a castle that belongs to the municipality (yes, that town was awesome and that part of my life was priceless) where lots of kids from the town used to play music or just chill and play games with the community workers.\n\nIt was around 10 p.m., I was with one good friend and on our way to come back home we had to walk past to the town graveyard. I told him I wanted to try to take some ghost pictures tonight and he was OK to come with me.\n\nIn front of the graveyard we met my little brother and four friends of him, they were coming back home too and they were chatting on a bench. They asked us what we were doing and I decided to tell us the truth. They were very enthusiastic and they asked me if they could come with us. This idea didn't very please me but I said Yes on one condition : They had to follow my instructions.\n\nThey were all OK and I told them that when we'll be inside the graveyard we all have to be quiet, respectful and aware of every strange feeling we could have. If someone feel something, just make me a sign and show me the direction so I can take a picture with the camera flash on.\n\nThen we all passed over the barrier and began to walk through the graveyard. The graveyard was divided into two parts, one old and creepy and one recent and pretty normal.\n\nI decided to go to the old part because there were a lot of statues and paths surrounded by large fir trees, it was creepy by itself. We walked between the graves, through the paths, everything around us was very scary. But, after a while and some random pictures, nobody felt anything weird.\n\nSo we decided to come back to the recent part to go outside of the graveyard and come back home. On our way to the barrier we were more relax and started to chat quietly and laugh a little bit, the pressure has faded away. We were walking with new graves on our left side when something very strange happened.\n\nMy brother turned to me, he was white as a sheet and tears were running on his cheeks. He said \"Take a picture ! SHE is right there !\". I was confused and I took a picture as fast as I could in the direction he showed me. After that, nobody said a word until we got out of the graveyard. Everybody were stunned and frightened.\n\nWhen we were out, we started to talk, my brother said he didn't know what happened. He did not see anything but he had a very powerful feeling that there was a woman just right where he showed me and that the feeling was so strange that some tears began to fall.\n\nWe said goodnight to his friends and we came back to our house with my brother and my friend. Once we got home, we wanted to see the pictures, so I connected the camera to my computer.\n\nMy mother and my stepfather were still awake so they came to see the pictures too. The first pictures were just some statues, old graves and there were nothing interesting. The only curious thing was the last picture, the picture my brother asked me to take. It was a new grave, with a lot of flowers on it, but behind that grave there was something unusual.\n\nThere was a white shape, not like a light or something, it was made of white thick smoke but rich in details. We could see a woman, she was small or on her knees, she was wearing a large dress, she had long hair and her head down, her hair were hiding half of her face.\n\nWe all saw her in the picture at the same time and we were shocked and scared. Except for my stepfather who immediately said that this was a prank and started to laugh. We could all see the woman, there were every details, like a normal person, but make of thin and dense smoke. He could see her too but he didn't want to admit that a thing like that could be possible.\n\nAfter that, I saved the picture on a floppy disk (remember...2003), we talked and tried to change our mind and after a while my friend went back to his house and everyone were going to bed.\n\nIt was one of the worst night I've ever had, I was sweating, shaking, thinking about the woman in the picture. I know it was only in my head but I'm pretty sure that between two dreams I felt something trying to pull my blanket. Anyway, I don't think this detail is important, I was just scared.\n\nThe next day, I took the floppy disk and decided to show the picture to everyone in the castle. So I came out of the house and on my way to the castle I went I front of the graveyard. This time it was daylight and my curiosity was stronger that my fear, I had to know who were on that grave.\n\nSo I walked into the graveyard, I found the grave and it was a man, apparently he was a football coach. So I checked the graves next to his, the place where the woman stood. It was a baby, he died at less than one year old. So I was a little bit confused and I went to next grave.\n\nAnd then there was the creepiest thing. It was a woman, a woman who died the year before, everyone in town knew her story because it was one of the most traumatic fact that happened last years.\n\nShe was in car with her husband and her daughter. The father was driving in a little road next to my town. He stopped the car on the side of the road, I don't know why, but the woman got out of the car, may be he wanted her to drive the car. So she walked around the car, but the car was parked in a sharp bend a little way down the top of a hill.\n\nSome young guys who were driving way too fast didn't see her, she was instantly hit and cut in half before the eyes of her family. Horrible story, that's why everyone knew her. It was chilling, I came out of the graveyard faster than I came in, with lots of scenarios in my head.\n\nI finally went to the castle and showed the picture to the guys who were near the computer and didn't say anything. Everyone saw the woman, but they all reacted like my stepfather, they started to laugh and said that it was a fake picture, that it was a prank.\n\nI didn't mind, the fact that they saw the woman on the picture prove that there is very something, whatever it is, everyone saw it. I kept showing the picture to everyone I know, only a few people believed me, but they all saw a woman too.\n\nOnly my friend, my brother and his friends know what really happened that night, the real circumstances of the picture, my brother and the tears, this is one of the most disturbing part of the story.\n\nI think you all wanna see the picture and I swear I wanna show it to you too, but back in 2003 when I showed the picture to everyone with my floppy disk, I lent it to an ex girlfriend so she could show the picture to her family, but she never gave it back to me.\n\nI truly regret to be unable to keep showing this picture to everyone, because it was the most accurate ghost or spirit picture I've ever seen, especially if you know what happened just before with my brother and who were in the graves where the shape was.\n\nSince that day, I'm truly convinced that there are things that we can not explain, whatever it is, it is real. This story keep haunting me eighteen years later.\n\nIf anyone had seen or lived anything like that or if you have any questions, please let me know.\n\nThank you for reading.","45":"I\u2019m in class, we\u2019re talking about scary short story writing or something like that, I\u2019m really not sure. I\u2019m so tired, maybe I can just rest my head for a little, just until the bell rings. I put my head down on the desk and soon enough I wasn\u2019t just resting my eyes, I full on passed out in my English class. \n\nI woke up to a dark empty classroom, \u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d I said to myself looking around \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d wake me up or the bell would have woken me.\u201d I stood up and picked my bag up, planning on just leaving. \u201cThis place really does look creepy after hours.\u201d I said looking down the darkened hallway, I have this weird feeling in my stomach, I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be here, but it\u2019s true, I really shouldn\u2019t be, I should be at home. My parents are probably wondering where I\u2019ve been anyways. \n\nI opened my phone to send them a text that I was on my way, the time read eight-seventeen pm \u201cHow did I sleep that long, how did no one wake me up or come looking for me?\u201d I questioned while going through my contacts, I found my moms number and sent her a text that I was on my way home and got held up after class.\n\u2018Sending error\u2019 popped up beside my message. \u201cNo signal? How?\u201d I asked confused, \u201cWhatever, stupid phone company, I should\u2019ve switched last week\u201d I said annoyed \u201cI just need to get to the exit and once i\u2019m outside it should send.\u201d. \n\nUpon getting to the entrance, the doors were locked. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I said, now getting a lot more annoyed than I was before. I slammed on the door, thinking it could be stuck or something. No budge. \u201cThey must\u2019ve locked the doors already, but they should still open from the inside\u2026\u201d I thought before giving up on that door. I walked around trying a few more different doors, same thing. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I actually just got locked in my own school\u201d I laughed to myself, it really was like something out of a terrible joke. \n\nI decided I\u2019d try to check the office, maybe someone else was staying late here. I walked into the office and looked around, empty. I checked the separate rooms and no one was there. \nI looked over to the announcement system, \u2018surely if someone is here they\u2019ll hear me over that\u2019 I thought and walked over to it. I pressed some of the buttons until I heard the beep from the speakers outside of the office that goes through the whole school. \u201cUhm, hello? Is anyone else here? I\u2019m sorry to be a bother but all the doors are locked and I need to get home.\u201d I explained, half expecting someone to pop up or call the office to help me out. But nothing. No response. \n\nI sat down in the chair, hungry and still tired. I dug into my bag and pulled out some fruit snacks. \u201cNice, if I knew I\u2019d be locked in here I would\u2019ve packed some actual food\u201d I said as I ate the fruit snacks. When I was done I found myself getting really tired again, fighting the urge to fall asleep. \n\nI looked down the hall from where I was sitting, it was fairly dark, but I could faintly see. \u2018Still no one coming\u2019 I thought as I looked over to the other side of the hall, but quickly I looked back as I saw someone in the corner of my eye turning down the hallway. \u201cFinally.\u201d I said under my breath, looking towards the person, but they were gone. \u201cHey! Come back!\u201d I  yelled down the hall at them, but nobody returned. \u201cSo much for staff who care.\u201d I rolled my eyes and stood up, speed walking down the hall towards the figure I\u2019d seen there only a few moments ago. \n\nAs I reached the end of the hall that I saw themat, the strong scent of old floral perfume filled my lungs, I had to catch my breath for a second, \u201cThat perfume she had on is so strong,\u201d I said looking down each hall to try to see where she had gone \u201cThe lavender tones to it aren\u2019t helping with the sleep I\u2019m fighting off either.\u201d \n\nI followed the perfume smell until it led me to a classroom.\nI looked into the door and there she was, just sitting there with her head facing down at a desk in the middle of the dark classroom. Without me even making a sound, she looked up at me. Immediately I got a terrible gut wrenching feeling, as though someone had just stabbed me right in the stomach, this wasn\u2019t any other student I had seen before. Her hair was dark and messy, as if she had just gotten out of bed, her eyes were dark and empty, pale skin as though she hadn\u2019t had any source of light in centuries, an old dirty nightgown hung loosely over her frail looking body. To add an extra turn to the knife I could already feel deep inside me, she silently smiled at me from her seat and pulled a chair next to her out, inviting me to come sit next to her. That\u2019s when I saw it, the dirty knife sitting there on the desk in front of her, and a new clean one in the seat next to her. \n\nI started backing away from the door, my gut was telling me to run, but something about her wouldn\u2019t let me move. She slowly stood up, picking the knife up with her, and began walking towards the door. \u2018I\u2019m screwed, I am going to die here, out of all places.\u2019 I thought to myself as she approached the door, dragging the knife across the glass on the window of the door. \n\nThe screeching noise it made as she did that managed to knock some sense back into my shaking body and I made a run for it, darting down the hall faster than I think I had ever run before. \u2018Hey if I make it out of here, the track team could really use me\u2019 I thought as I ran past the dull looking trophy case. I went back into the main office and hid under a desk. \u201cThere's no way this is real.\u201d I whispered, my voice shaking from fear. Steps began approaching from down the hallway, I could hear her dragging her blade across the lockers and doors in between them, I knew she was looking for me, she wants me to die here, whether she\u2019s already dead or not. There\u2019s no way I was going to join her, I refuse to die in a school. \n\nMy heart raced faster and faster as the footsteps got closer and closer, I could hear her softly singing a faint tune that sounded so familiar. \u201cLullaby, and goodnight, with roses bestride,\u201d She sang. \u201cBrahms Lullaby.\u201d I whispered to myself. My Mother used to sing that to me when I was a child. As her soft lullaby grew closer and she arrived at the office doorway, I could smell her strong perfume once again. Never in my life had I ever prayed to be dreaming, but this felt all too real to be that. The mellow lullaby she sang, mixed with the lavender entwined floral perfume made it harder and harder to fight off the sleep which my body was aching for. \n\nAs she made her way around the office area, the lullaby came to an end. The silence was stiff and the sound of my heart beating rapidly filled my ears. \u201cCome on, you can fall asleep after you come out,\u201d She said. Her voice was so beautiful and soft, like your favourite blanket from when you were a child. I felt drawn in, the thought of sleep and hearing her sweet lullaby again, it felt all too appealing to my sleep deprived mind. Her pause didn\u2019t last long, \u201cWe have all of eternity to rest here, somewhere between life and death, purgatory, a netherworld.\u201d She finished and began humming the lullaby once again.\n\n \u2018Am I really going to be stuck here forever?\u2019 The thought killed me inside, but I could also find comfort in it. No more stress, just her and I here, all the time in the world to sleep, to be at peace, no more worries. \u201cNo.\u201d I told myself \u201cI have a life, friends, family, whether it comes with stress, less sleep, worries, I don\u2019t care. Dying here is giving in and I refuse to give in, this life is tempting but my own is one unwritten and unlived, I\u2019m still young, I must get out of here.\u201d I said as I leaned out from my hiding place and looked around the room. There she was in the hall, she had begun her search again, as well as singing the lullaby once more. \n\nI picked my bag up and quietly started to leave the office area, going in the opposite direction as her. I still had no plan, the doors clearly weren\u2019t an option and no one was coming to save me, this isn\u2019t real life, it can\u2019t be, real life doesn\u2019t have ghostly looking girls who sing lullabies and ask you to stay with them in a netherworld for eternity. \nAs I walked down the hallway I tripped over my own shoelace, the keychains on my bag made a loud jingling noise and the faint lullaby came to a stop. I felt my heart drop once again as any ounce of hope I had left of surviving this nightmare left my body. \n\nI turned and looked over at her, she was staring back at me, her empty, tired eyes burning into me. \u2018This is it.\u2019 I thought as she approached me once more, the knife in her hand glinting in the darkness. My feet felt like two cement bricks on the hall floors, unable to move, speak, do anything to save myself from this terrifying, soul enticing creature. She\u2019s within arms reach now, my death slowly coming closer. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d She said hauntingly, \u201cIt\u2019ll only hurt for a second, then you can sleep as long as you\u2019d like, we can be here forever, together.\u201d Her words were chilling, but also felt like a deep hug. I tried to bring myself to speak, to tell her I couldn\u2019t stay here, that it wasn\u2019t my time to join her here, as illustrious of a temptress she was, I wouldn\u2019t give into her offers, but nothing came out. \u201cYou don\u2019t wish to stay here with me,\u201d She said while raising her knife, \u201cBut leaving isn\u2019t an option, and I can\u2019t let you go, I'm sorry.\u201d She finished as she brought the knife across my throat. \n\nFor a moment it felt as if I could see sadness in those empty eyes, as though she genuinely was sorry, but if she was then how could she bring me to this sort of death, it didn\u2019t matter now anyways, there was no stopping this, I closed my eyes and let death engulf me. \n\nI felt a hand on my shoulder shaking me, I opened my eyes and my body shot up, gasping for air. \u201cWoah are you okay?\u201d My friend asked me, concerned \u201cYou look as if you had seen a ghost.\u201d She laughed. I looked around the room, I was back in my English class, surrounded by my classmates. \u201cCareful falling asleep in class,\u201d She said \u201cYou\u2019ll end up like the girl from Mr. Skibas story.\u201d She said spookily, as if she were a part of some haunted house. \u201cWhat story?\u201d I asked her, confused and coming out of my deep sleep. \u201cThe one he just told, you must\u2019ve been asleep, apparently years ago some girl fell asleep in class too much, and one day as some sick joke they all just left her in the school and locked the doors,\u201d She told me coming in closer, \u201cShe ended up dying here because no one remembered to come back for her, they found her body when they came back from the break.\u201d She finished. \n\nI looked at her \u201cDo you think it's real?\u201d I asked her, she scoffed, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d She asked me, looking at me as though I had just proposed some outlandish question. \u201cMr. Skiba is getting old, he\u2019s just losing it a little I think, he claims he can still smell her perfume in the halls somedays.\u201d She said looking over at the older man. I laughed a little. \u201cYeah, must be just some tale he made up to scare kids out of falling asleep during his boring class.\u201d I said and stood up as the bell rang, walking into the hall with her. \n\nThat smell. The same perfume from the dream, if you can call it that. \u201cAre you good?\u201d She asked, looking at me. \u201cGod, you really need to get more sleep.\u201d She said, I didn\u2019t reply, I\u2019m too lost in my own thoughts. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks since my encounter with that ghost girl in the nightmare I had in that class, I haven\u2019t fallen asleep in class since, hell I\u2019ve barely slept since. When I do, all I can hear is her lullaby and I wake up choking in her strong perfume. \nI can\u2019t tell if I ever really woke up, or if this is just my mind playing things out after I died to her blade. Real or not, it's better than being stuck there for eternity. \n\nOne day I may end up joining her, until then I\u2019m choosing not to let my doubt of realness affect my life. Is there really any reason to believe this life is less valuable if it isn\u2019t real, if I cannot know the difference?","46":"I used to wish for something exciting to happen in my humdrum life. After the events of the last two days, all I can say is, be careful what you wish for.\n\nI am a porter in the local hospital and live in a cramped apartment that's close enough to walk to work if I want, but also close enough for the view at night from my window to be dominated by the plume of smoke which rises, as darkness falls, from the chimney of the hospital incinerator.\n\nI know what is being burnt in it. I help take it there and cannot help but think of what will remain even after the intense heat, of the fine ash that will fall back to earth.\n\nI live alone and dwell too much on things like this.\n\nOn top of this, the pay for my job is lousy and I have a lot of debt. There's a credit card in particular that I'm struggling with. The account has been handed over to a collection agency and I am constantly expecting a knock on the door. Up to now they have restricted themselves to phoning daily.\n\nI usually let my mobile go to answerphone and deleted the messages unread - until yesterday, when I had half a dozen missed calls showing when I checked my phone at the end of my shift.\n\nThings, I figured, must have escalated with the debt and I decided I needed to take my head out of the sand.\n\nFeeling sick with worry, I pressed play on my messages.\n\nTo my surprise, they were all from a lawyer. He urgently needed to talk to me about my sister's will.\n\nI would not say that I had ever been close to my sister. We grew up in the same house but pretty much avoided each other as much as we could. She moved out when she turned eighteen. I stayed on till I was twenty-five - leeching off my parents, if the truth be told.\n\nBy then my sister was flying high. She was marketing director for a company with its hooks in dozens of countries and was making big bucks. A few times I reached out to her asking for a helping hand, but she never got back to me.\n\nLooking in the mirror I see someone who gets through the day, nothing more, nothing less, so I never blamed her for keeping me at a distance.\n\nStill, I was shocked. Did this mean she had passed away? I did the math. She was only thirty eight, two years younger than me.\n\nMy hands were shaking as I dialled the number the lawyer had left.\n\nThey were shaking worse thirty minutes later as I was turning the ignition key in my car, which I kept parked up round the corner from my apartment.\n\nMy little sister was dead, he had told me. And she had left me a sizeable bequest in her will. But there was a condition which needed to be discussed, in person, as soon as possible.\n\nIgnoring a call I knew to be from the collection agency, I set off.\n\nI thought wistfully of how soon I would be able to phone them and pay off the debt in full. That would be such a relief.\n\nSizeable. Surely that meant thousands. Maybe more.\n\nI am ashamed to say that I was more excited than sad as I reached the lawyer's office in a bland complex in the centre of town.\n\nIt was getting late by now and there was no one on reception, so I pressed the button next to the lawyer's  nameplate. He answered and said he would be right out.\n\nHe was a middle aged, dressed smartly, and seemed to blend in to the tidy yet bland surroundings of the office. \n\nAs he began to talk about the will, I bit down on my urge to tell him to hurry up. To get to the how much. \n\nWhen he finally did, I had a new urge to resist: Jumping up and down and hollering with delight.\n\nI was line to inherit a cool quarter of a million. \n\nMy problems washed away before my glazed over eyes and I began to see a future of wonderful laziness.\n\nThen he went and ruined it all.\n\n\"There is a condition,\" he said.  \"As I mentioned on the phone.\"\n\nYeah, yeah, I thought. Whatever.\n\nHe cleared his throat. \"You sister had a concern regarding her burial. She was afraid, you see, of being buried alive and waking up underground with no way out. It was quite the terror.\"\n\n\"But she is dead,\" I pointed out. \"You told me that.\"\n\n\"She is. Her death was certified by a suitable medical professional and the paperwork is sound.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"To help assuage her fear she had her coffin fitted with a two way radio.\" At this point, he opened a drawer and took out a walkie talkie before continuing. \"So that in the eventuality she has been buried alive and comes round, she can call someone and they can rescue her.\"\n\nI did not like the way this was going. \"Someone?\" I asked.\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes, you. The condition of receiving your inheritance is to take this radio and wait by your sister's grave for a period of no less that five days. After that time, if you do not hear from her, you are free to leave and may return to this office where I will arrange the transfer of funds.\"\n\n\"That's batshit crazy,\" I said.\n\n\"I prefer perfectly legal,\" he replied.\n\nHe slid the radio towards me over the polished surface of his mahogany desk. \n\n\"A quarter of a million dollars,\" I said.\n\n\"It could be in your account by this time next week.\"\n\nWhat else was I meant to do? I said yes. I would do it.\n\nI did though have one more question before I left. I turned back to look at the lawyer. \"My sister never rated me. Even though this is insane, why should she trust me with her life like this?\"\n\nThe lawyer did not miss a beat before answering. \"She told me if she did come back she did not want any of her colleagues or circle of highly placed friends to know about her concern. Being viewed as fearless holds a lot of currency in big business. Not that you would know anything about that.\" \n\nHe moved his attention to some papers on his desk.\n\nArrogant S.O.B, I thought and stormed off. \n\nNow, in the spirit of honesty which I am trying to stick to here, I will tell you that initially I was not going to go anywhere near the graveyard where the lawyer told me my sister was buried. \n\nI was going to go back and sit in my apartment, phone in sick to work as I would soon no longer need the pittance they paid me, and go back to ignoring my phone. In five days time I would head back to the lawyer and wearing my best loyal hound dog face tell him how I waited by the grave with the radio to my ear through rain and shine, darkness and daylight, and there was not a peep come crackling over the shortwave from my sister, Lawd rest her soul.\n\nNow give me my damn money.\n\nBut no, I decided as I was driving home, I would for once show I was reliable, a good and trusty soul. I swung a left, headed for the graveyard.\n\nIt was a big, old, municipal place. The resting place for thousands over the years and it took me the best part of an hour to find my sister. I am not sure if everywhere I drove cars were allowed but it was heading towards midnight by this time and I was shattered. \n\nEventually my headlights illuminated her name. Her headstone was fancy looking and I guessed she would have been buried in some mighty fine clothes as well. In one of her silk gloved hands, the undertaker would have tucked a radio, like the one I held.  \n\nI pressed the transmit button and said with a wry grin on my face, \"Breaker, breaker. Do you copy?\" \n\nSilence followed.\n\nOf course it did.\n\nMy sister was dead and buried, and the future was bright. I started to think about what type of TV I would buy. The walls in my poky apartment were too small for the best widescreens I had admired in showrooms until I had been asked to leave. Obviously, I would also have to upgrade my accommodation.\n\nThis was sweet.\n\n\"Is that you?\"\n\nThe voice came from the radio. I almost dropped it, I was so surprised.\n\nIt couldn't be.\n\n\"Is that you, loser!\"\n\nThe voice broke out of the radio's speaker, loud and clear.\n\nIt was my sister.\n\nI pressed the button to reply. \"Yes,\" I mumbled.\n\n\"You dipshit,\" she snapped back, \"What took you so long?\"\n\n\"I was at the lawyers,\" I began to explain. \"He told me about...\"\n\nShe cut me off. \"I don't care. Just get me out of here.\"\n\n\"I will go get help.\" I was ready to bolt, ready to flag down the first fire truck or police wagon I saw and scream, Help!\n\n\"No.\" Her voice was distinct and sure. \"I don't want anyone else to know. I have a reputation to maintain.\"\n\n\"But?\" I managed. \n\nThen the instruction came, \"Dig me up,\"\n\nI was too freaked out to ask if it was OK for me to go get a shovel from somewhere. I fell down onto my hands and knees and began to paw at the dirt. \n\nIt took a long time and all the while I had my sister bitching at me how I was a good for nothing. \n\nFinally, with the first streaks of red appearing in the dawn sky, I made it down to the coffin lid.\n\nHow on earth was I meant to open it though with my bare hands?\n\nI was still wondering when I head a click and the lid began to rise. \n\nTurns out she had a latch inside.\n\nI stood there and watched then as my sister sat up.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the smell.\n\nIt was bad, like a house that's been shut for ages and has gone mouldy. There's a possum died in there as well at some point, down in the cellar, and boy it was ripe.\n\nHer skin was grey and puffy under her otherwise still immaculately made up face. She was wearing a long black dress that probably cost more than I made in year.\n\nI offered my hand, and when she accepted my help to stand, the feel of her skin against mine made me want to retch.\n\nShe felt so cold and dry.\n\nI tried not to show the nausea I was feeling. Asked instead the pressing question:\n\n\"Do I still get the money.\"\n\nShe looked at me. Her eyes were bloodshot and some of the veins looked like they were wriggling. Almost like there were tiny worms in there.\n\nWhich there could not have been, because it would be agonising. \n\nIn fact, the only problem my sister seemed to have was me.\n\n\"You have a brain, you just never used it,\" she told me.\n\nThen stared me at me intently. She seemed to be thinking, and her tone was different when she said, \"I'm hungry.\" The scorn had disappeared and all I could hear was desire.\n\n\"So hungry.\" She put her hand on the top of my head.\n\n\"Quit that,\" I said. \n\nShe ran her tongue across her lips. I noticed for the first time how cracked they were under the layer of lipstick. Dark flesh showed where her skin had broken open. \n\n\"Feeding time,\" she whispered as I stared - and launched herself at me. \n\nI recoiled, managed to miss her teeth.\n\nShe had tried to bite me. Crap! \n\nI realised my sister was one of the living dead. My sister was a frigging zombie.\n\nShe screamed, bared her teeth. Was going to come at me again, and eat my brain.\n\nThe object of her hunger was by this point completely frazzled with terror. I was going to die at the hands of a monster that I had helped out of its prison and I was scared beyond belief. \n\nMy stomach cramped. Sweat dripped from my face. \n\nShe moved towards me. Drool fell from her mouth, and held in its sticky grasp was a fat insect. It must have been inside her mouth, feasting on her rotting flesh.\n\n\"No!\" I yelled in desperation and ran at her.\n\nSomehow, her head was snapped back against the lid of the coffin and I heard a sickening crack. Her eyes rolled up and her hands flailed at the air. I began to stagger away.\n\nIt is Wednesday evening where I am now and I am waiting for the five days to be up. I know the money won't mean I can forget what happened, won't stop me waking up screaming. But it does mean I can get away from here and try and start a new life with as clean a conscience as I can have.\n\nI hope I did the right thing. I did not leave my sister struggling to get back out of her grave. I knew I had to finish her, so I did. I've seen enough zombie movies to know how. And afterwards, I filled the grave back in and I put her body in the boot of my car and I took it to the hospital.\n\nIt is dark outside. The smoke is rising from the chimney of the incinerator. \n\nI think of what will remain even after the intense heat, of the fine ash that will fall back to earth.\n\nI know what it contains.","47":"[\\[Part 1\\]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qq83wq\/lost_in_a_snowstorm_i_have_stumbled_into_an\/)\n\n**WARNING:** Story contains details of and discussion of **suicide**.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cSo what\u2019s your deal, Ellie?\u201d I ask, mouth dry. \u201cAre you a ghost, or something?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s meant as a half-joke, really.

I could just turn around and run back the way I came, back into the storm\u2026 Though I\u2019m not convinced by what she tells me. The idea that the eels will just ignore me is a nice one, but I don\u2019t know how true it is. I\u2019m not sure she really *knows* either.\n\n\u201cHow did you die?\u201d I ask, a little awkwardly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking\u201d.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t reply at first. She only goes back to studying the watch. She holds her hands above it, and then I observe in awe as she draws them suddenly back, and a glowing representation of the watch\u2019s inner-mechanisms are blown up and fixed in place in the air just above us. Cogs and gears, all stilled.\n\n\u201cWoah\u201d, I murmur, and she smiles. Then she sighs, and the smile escapes from her face.\n\n\u201cYou can see for yourself\u2026 if you really want\u201d, she says, pointing to the mirror in the corner of the room. \u201cThough it\u2019s not a fun story, so, be warned, I guess\u201d.\n\nCautiously, I make to head over, and she seems to have some second thoughts. \u201cWait\u201d, she says suddenly, \u201cactually I don\u2019t think that\u2019s much of a good idea. You should just leave, honestly. The creatures won\u2019t hurt you. I\u2019m just waiting here. Seriously, you don\u2019t have to look\u201d.\n\nBut it\u2019s too late now, my curiosity is piqued. And it might well count towards my safety and survival, so\u2026\n\n\u2026So I turn back to the mirror and stride towards it.\n\n\u201cWAIT!\u201d she shouts as I put out a hand\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...And it passes through the surface of the mirror like water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll around me at once is mist. Swirling, glass-like mist and distorted cries from behind. Ellie is calling me back, but it\u2019s too late. I have stepped through and now I am falling; there is nothing to keep me anchored\u2026\n\n\u2026And I land with a thump and a groan at the entrance to the school. I am outside. But there is no snow, right now. I jump to my feet and receive some strange looks- as I am surrounded by kids, all roughly my own age- though I don\u2019t recognise a single person by sight. I glance back to the building.\n\nIt\u2019s very different in the pale grey light of this particular overcast morning, but it\u2019s the same school, alright.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*But* ***when***\u2026?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m an avid reader, and it always infuriates me when I\u2019m forced to spend paragraph after paragraph, and page after page reading through the main character\u2019s gaping and gawking and narrow-minded disbelief\u2026 So I swore to myself, once, many years ago, that if ever I found myself in an unlikely and unpredictable situation that I would do my best to just roll with it. To take stock and act as logically as I am able\u2026 So I take off my coat and wrap it around my waist\u2026 I smooth back some of the ruffles in my hair\u2026 and I do my best to uphold that promise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI take a quick look behind me, but naturally any evidence of a mirror or any kind of ethereal doorway has vanished.\n\n\u2026Very well.\n\nI turn back to the entrance doors to the school, and I join my apparent peers. Climbing the steps and heading on inside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe kids all around me are giving me strange looks, and I am at once incredibly self-conscious.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the new kid?\u201d I hear one girl whisper to another. I glance to my left at the school\u2019s logo.\n\n*\u2018Ad Meloria, Ad Lucem\u2019.*\n\nI wonder for the second time what it might mean. Nothing, probably. Schools round here love their Latin mottos.\n\n*Round* ***where***, *Sam? Where the hell even are you?*\n\nI reach down to my pocket for my phone, a renewed chance to check Maps, perhaps, but my pockets are empty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201c*You can\u2019t take anything with you*\u201d, comes the voice of Ellie from above and all around, and I swivel on the spot, staring up the ceiling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cHey! Where are you?\u201d I call out, and the conversations around me fall to a hush, and then change to stifled laughter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cWho the hell is this guy talking to..?\u201d\n\nI flush and make to stride down one of the school\u2019s corridors, bumping hard into a girl in a bright purple coat as I do so, knocking her books to the floor.\n\nShe looks up at me and flushes in turn, brow furrowed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it\u2019s her.\n\n\u2026It\u2019s Ellie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cEllie!\u201d I say, \u201chelp me out here, please! At least a little clue would be nice!\u201d\n\nShe stares at me, expression uncertain. Then, after a pause- \u201csorry\u2026 do I know you?\u201d\n\nI cock my head. \u201cIt\u2019s Sam. We were speaking just now. You called out to me\u201d.\n\nShe shakes her head, maintaining eye contact. \u201cNo\u2026 No, sorry. I don\u2019t remember you. I\u2019m sorry\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Get a grip, Sam. Think logically.*\n\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d I manage, \u201cum, sorry. Here let me\u2026 let me help you with your stuff\u201d. I crouch down to the ground to collect her books. Two science books and a purple, personal journal of some kind. It\u2019s fallen open to a page with the header:\n\n\u2018LAST DAY\u2019.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeneath is a list of stuff. I manage to read a couple of the items in confusion before she snatches it out of my hand:\n\n**\u2018-Apologise to Mrs Reeves\u2019.**\n\n**\u2018-Clear out locker\u2019.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI look up at her. \u201cWhat\u2026 what does \u2018Last Day\u2019 mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to go\u201d, she replies quickly, stuffing her things into her bag and hurrying away into the crowds.\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I call after her, \u201cwait up! Come back!\u201d\n\nBut she does not.\n\n\u201cFuck\u2019s sake\u201d, I mutter to myself, rubbing a hand across my forehead.\n\n\u201cLanguage, young man\u201d, comes the sharp voice of a teacher behind me.\n\nI turn to him. \u201cOh, uh, sorry\u201d.\n\nHe squints down at me. \u201cDo I know you, lad?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m- I\u2019m new\u201d.\n\n\u201cRight, well. You\u2019ll be expected in registration then, won\u2019t you. Name?\u201d\n\nI give it, and the teacher is of course unable to find me in the records at the desk. \u201cWell\u201d, he says, \u201cjust spend the morning with Mrs Reeves. Your timetable should largely follow that of the other students\u2026 Do you know if you\u2019re in History or Geography?\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, History\u201d, I lie, and the teacher nods.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a schedule printed for you. Room 8G for now though, Sam. And don\u2019t let me catch you swearing again\u201d.\n\n\u201cRight, yeah. Sorry Sir. Gotcha\u201d. I nod and take a quick leave, running the great barrels of new information through my head as I walk. Trying my best to process, to act soundly.\n\n\u2026Something rumbles in the distance. I swear I can see a glimpse of a shadow pass me by\u2026 but when I turn to look for the shadow\u2019s source, there is nothing there, nor do any of the other kids seem to notice. I swallow anxiously.\n\n*Control your fear. Learn what\u2019s going on, and improvise.*\n\nI have my suspicions already, but, it would be good to get confirmation\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI follow the letters and numbers written on the doors until I find classroom 8G, whereupon I knock and push through into the room, instantly awkward and aware of every movement of my body as all the eyes of the kids behind the desks shift to mine, at once.\n\n\u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d the teacher asks, looking down her glasses at me. My eyes dart from her to the kids in the class. To a girl sitting by herself near the back.\n\n\u201cEllie!\u201d I blurt out without thinking, to an eruption of laughter from the room.\n\nEllie herself flushes a deep colour and looks down to the desk.\n\nMrs Reeves looks between us and sighs. \u201cI find that unlikely, young man. *Your* name, please?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry\u2026 It\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s Sam\u201d.\n\n\u201cWell, Sam, you may as well take the seat next to Ellie for now, since you seem to know her already\u201d.\n\nAs I walk the length of the room and settle into the seat the whispers and murmurs and giggles rise up almost immediately. Ellie shoots me a dirty look.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do that for?\u201d she hisses at me as I sit down.\n\n\u201cSorry\u201d, I say back, \u201cit was an accident. I\u2019m under a lot of stress, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re not the only one\u2026\u201d she mutters under her breath.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere\u2019s a strained pause.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think of Ellie the ghost I met not an hour or so ago. Of the journal\u2026\n\n***Last Day\u2026***\n\n\u201cEllie\u2026\u201d I begin softly.\n\n*How do I phrase this\u2026?*\n\n\u201cAre you\u2026 are you planning on this being your last day?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026Are you planning to\u2026 kill yourself?\u201d\n\nShe swivels to stare right at me. \u201cWhat the FUCK is wrong with you?\u201d she hisses just a little too loudly.\n\n\u201cEllie!\u201d Mrs Reeves calls from the front, interrupting her reading of register. Ellie gives her an apologetic look, then turns right back to me.\n\n\u201cWho the hell are you? Genuinely? What are you doing here, Sam?\u201d\n\n*The exact same questions I was asking her a few long moments ago.*\n\n\u201cI asked first. Are you or are you not planning to kill yourself?\u201d\n\nShe chews her cheek and looks away.\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m not\u201d.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u201d, I say to her.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t believe me. Just do me a favour and fuck off okay?\u201d\n\nTo this I say nothing, though, a few seconds later she turns back to me, eyes still downcast: \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean that. It\u2019s been\u2026 it\u2019s been a tough few\u2026 days\u201d.\n\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s, yeah it\u2019s okay\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe sit together- and yet, a chasm apart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bell rings to begin the day and, much to Ellie\u2019s annoyance, I spend much of it trailing her around.\n\nI\u2019m forced away from her by way of various seating plans, and the like. Some kids try to introduce themselves to me and I ignore them. A little rude, perhaps, but I have priorities here. I\u2019m trying to work out the lay of the land. Ellie rejects and pushes back all my attempts to broach conversation. I can tell she is curious about me, but it isn\u2019t enough to stop her keeping me at an arm\u2019s length.\n\nShe escapes me through the crowds completely at lunch, and disappears entirely for the lesson immediately after\u2026 and then, in the final period, I am witness to an excruciatingly cringey display of her public speaking, as she stammers and fumbles for a painfully long time through an extract of *Romeo & Juliet*. It\u2019s so bad, in fact, that I forget why I am here for a moment and struggle to hold back giggles.\n\nEllie seems less than amused, and does not even look back when I call out after her at the day\u2019s end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2:59pm, read the clock on the lobby wall as I left through the doors. At this time of year the sun has already begun to sink low in the sky.\n\nI am walking behind her and we are leaving the school behind. They let us go a couple of minutes early.\n\nA gust of wind ruffles through my hair and rustles the collar of my coat.\n\nMy mood suddenly drops and I am met with the stomach-churning sensation that I am\u2026  running out of time...\n\n*Time.*\n\n\u201cEllie!\u201d I call out, though it\u2019s becoming, I find, harder to speak. I am forced to project to raise my voice beyond a whisper\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2026And there\u2019s that sensation again\u2026 the feeling of walking through water.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI struggle against the winds and the thickness of its air; the lowering sun glints orange and sends Ellie\u2019s shadow long and dark back towards me as the gap between us widens\u2026\n\n\u2026And all around are the creatures, now. Slow and rumbling they push aside the air at various heights. They look down to the girl, hungry and eyes a-glow. One looks to me as it rises up and up into the air\u2026 its jaw distends\u2026\n\n\u2026And the mists shimmer and fog from behind and beside. I am lost in the cloud as I call out for her, but my voice does not work the way it is supposed to. My sight is obscured and I close my eyes tight shut. But when I open them again\u2026\n\n\u2026I am stumbling to the floor of the classroom. I land with a clatter and a grunt, and a groan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2026*Ugh.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI clamber unsteadily to my feet and try to regather my bearings.\n\nBehind me is the mirror, softly shimmering as before. My dishevelled reflection looks back at me.\n\nThe classroom is just as I left it, I think, though it is darker now. We are well into the night.\n\nEllie- or the ghost Ellie- is humming softly to herself, still studying the projection she has made of my watch\u2019s inner-mechanisms. She raises her hands and makes little circles with her fingers, and as she does so the projected gears and cogs turn with them; they slide into new places as she ponders and tweaks.\n\n\u201cHave fun?\u201d she asks, without looking over to me.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d, I reply. \u201cNot really\u201d.\n\nShe smirks humourlessly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t better company\u201d.\n\n\u201cEllie\u2026\u201d I step close to the girl and sit down on the desk right by her as the snow rages beyond the window. \u201cWhat happened here?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, if you haven\u2019t worked it out by now then you\u2019re really never going to get it, Sam\u201d, she says.\n\n\u201cSo you killed yourself then, is that it? That was your \u2018Last Day\u2019. And you go home from school and take your own life\u201d.\n\n\u201c*Take my own life\u2026* so dramatic\u201d, she murmurs, but still she does not look directly at me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the monstrous eels shivers its way past the window, and this time I swear I can hear a deep, low hiss to accompany its subtle rumbling. I swallow down a mouthful of fear and am returned to awareness of how cold the room is. My breath clouds.\n\n*Was it quite this cold before..?*\n\nThe mood shifts.\n\nI\u2019ve never been much good with stuff like this. It\u2019s just as well that I can\u2019t physically touch Ellie, otherwise I\u2019d be trying to work out whether I should awkwardly take her hand, or something.\n\n\u201cCan I ask why?\u201d I say softly, and she finally stops doing what she\u2019s doing and turns to look at me.\n\nShe chews her tongue for a moment, then shrugs and brushes that loose strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cI was just sad, I guess. And there was no real chance for me to be less sad going forwards. There was just a lot of stress going on in my life. It was easier for everyone if I wasn\u2019t there\u201d.\n\n\u201cBullshit\u201d, I reply, and she stares at me.\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said that\u2019s bullshit!\u201d and suddenly I am angry. \u201cHow could you kill yourself!? How could you do something like that!? What the hell is wrong with you? Look at all that you\u2019ve done! You\u2019re trapped here and you\u2019ve fucked up the cosmic order of the universe, or something, I don\u2019t know-\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy the hell do you even care so much!?\u201d she shouts back at me. \u201cWhy are you even still here? Just GO! GO, Sam! It\u2019s too late now anyway! It\u2019s done!\u201d\n\nI shoot a look back behind me, tensed and determined. \u201cWell see about that\u201d, I mutter, and turn my back to her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cSam, STOP!\u201d she shouts, as I leave her behind for the second time. As I stride right on back towards the mirror, the shadows of the night blown out billowing behind me.\n\n [\\[Part 3\\]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qrx4xt\/lost_in_a_snowstorm_i_have_stumbled_into_an\/) ","48":"[Part I](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qqu561\/patient_367_urban_exploring_at_an_abandoned\/)\n\nI flung the heavy door wide open and more or less crashed in to the nearest table and threw the file open again. There was no doubt, that was a picture of me! How in the hell could this be? The picture was without a doubt old, easily from 1912 when the file was created. It was faded, curled up in it\u00b4s corners, yellowish tint over the whole thing, but damnit, that was me!\n\nI had to sit down and catch my breath, this was insane! I couldn\u00b4t sort my thoughts out, I tried to figure out possible explanations for this, maybe, it was a relative of mine, someone I had never heard of? Maybe it was all just a coincident, or my tired mind was playing tricks on me? I turned back to the first page. Room 272. That\u00b4s what I heard in the staircase too...\n\nI needed to check it out. I was done filmning, I was to freaked out to even think about making a youtube-video out of this. I packed my camera and set the bags by the entrance door and started to walk upstairs again. I got to the third floor and turned left, down the east wing of the main building, 268, 269, 270, 271...there. Room 272.\n\nThe door was ajar and made a high pitched creak when I slowly pushed it open. It was nothing out of the ordinary, it looked just like the other patient rooms I had seen here. It did however, feel different.It felt familiar, I knew this room. I suddenly got extremly dizzy, this was all to much. I had to sit down on the bed, but before I even had finished that thought everything turned black. I passed out.\n\nI woke up to the sound of voices near me. - He says that he visits abandoned asylums, prisons, hospitals and so on, and showcases them for others to see. I heard them say - Is he still holding on to that character? - Yes, I\u00b4m afraid so.\n\nI opened my eyes, my head hurt, blurry vision, I couldn\u00b4t move. - Yes, It\u00b4s Patient nr: 367, Jeremiah Robertson, I heard from somewhere near. - What the hell is going on! I yelled out. No respons. I tried to look around to see where I was, and that\u00b4s when I realized my head was fixated. Out ot the corner of my eye I saw the medical cabinets..\n\nMr.Robertson, I suddenly heard someone say. Who\u00b4s there?! I yelled, Where the hell am I, what is going on?\nMr.Robertson, I need you to calm down, can you do that for me? The voice said.\nI am NOT Mr.Robertson, I replied. My name is Jason and you have no fucking right to...he interupted me.\nYes, Jason, I know who you are, we have met before, many times. I was stunned. What do you mean we have met before? Who are you?!\n\nMy name is Dr. John L. Thomas, and if you are willing to calm youself, we can loosen these restraints and have a nice calm conversation. Alright?\n\nYeah..Alright, i studdered. I was far to much in shock to make any kind of resistance at this point, I gave up and took some deep breaths. Two big men in short hair, dressed in white uniforms started to release the straps holding me down and helped me up in a sitting position. One of them stood behind me and the other next to the man I now recognized from the fallen oil painting in the lobby to be Dr. John L. Thomas.\n\nMr Robertson, he continued. I\u00b4m afraid you have suffered another episode.\n\nListen Doctor, I said. I don\u00b4t know who you think I am, but my name isn\u00b4t Robertson. My name is Jason, and I\u00b4m a..\n\nUrban Explorer, yes we know, you have told us many times.\n\nI don\u00b4t understand, I said, I\u00b4ve never met you before, I never been here before! And... how the hell did you clean this place up so fast? Everything looks brand new? I looked around, there were no paint falling of the walls, the floor was impeccable, rows of folders stood neatly positioned in the bookshelfs. I glanced out of the room and saw nurses and orderlies walk past, patients in wheel chairs being pushed around, it looked like I was back when the place was in its prime.\n\nI sat with my mouth open trying to grasp what I was seeing. - As I said, the Doctor continued. I understand that this is all very confusing, but let me assure you, we\u00b4ve been through this many times you and me. And it\u00b4s about time we finaly did something about it. He motioned for the orderly next to him to fetch a wheelchair that stood in the corner.\n\nRoom 272, it\u00b4s time! Someone shouted from the hallway.\n\nCome with me, he said as I felt the big hand from the man behind me grab hold of my arm to assist me down into the wheel chair. They started to strap my arms down down to the wheelchair and I tried to pull away.\n\nNow now, Dr.Thomas said, theres nothing to be afraid of Mr.Robertson, this is only for your own protection, we will release you as soon as we arrive, alright? Ariive where, I thought. I took another deep breath and tried to relax. I needed to play along to understand what the hell was going on. Ok.. I said, nodding my head, and I let them strap my arms down.\n\nWe got out into the hallway, Dr.Thomas walking in front of me, slowly packing his round pipe with tobaco. Both of the big guys walking behind me, one pushing the wheelchair. I couldn\u00b4t believe what I was seeing. There were people everywhere here, all the rooms had patients in them, nurses walking back and forth with equipment or charts. It was first now that I noticed that I had the robe on, the same I had seen in one of the abandoned rooms before, with the \u201dFairmedow Asylum\u201d text printed on the back. I started to feel the panic creep up on me.\n\nAs I said before, Dr.Thomas continued, We have had this conversation many times before. Unfortunatly I don\u00b4t think our sessions have had any real impact on your condition. Even though the episodes come less frequently, I have noticed that when they do come, they tend to affect you deeper every time. Every time you seem more and more convinced of this, reality of yours. We had come to a stop in front of the now fully functional elevator, I saw the arrow above it moving from floor one to two, then from two to three, a clear bell rang as the doors slowly opened up. The doctor walked up behind me and thanked the orderlies. I can take it from here, he said, sending them back to the hallway of the third floor. He rolled me in to the elevator and pressed the button for the fourth floor.\n\nNow don\u00b4t you worry about this Mr.Robertson, we are quite sure that we will rid you of this condition once and for all. Rid you of this, Jason-personality that you have conjured up.\n\nNow, the panic set in for real. - No no no, where are you taking me? I\u00b4m not a fucking personality, I\u00b4m a real person! You can\u00b4t do this! I started to freak out as the doors slowly opened on the fourth floor. Two new, just as big, ordelies were waiting on the other side of the elevator doors to assist the doctor. Once again he walked in front while I was being pushed by these, clones. They all looked alike. I now knew where we were going. We took the turn in to the secondary building, and then in to OPR2. It looked the same as it had done when I was here, just moments ago, though as with the rest of the place, it was spotless, shiny and looked brand new.\n\nThe doctor came up to me and put a hand on my shoulder. Relax, he said, we have done this many times before, you have nothing to worry about. Soon, you will be back to normal, back to good old Mr.Robertson. He reached down and unclasped a bracelet from my wrist, I hadn\u00b4t even noticed it before. He then went over to the desk in the corner, there was a nurse sitting there. He handed the bracelet over to her and I saw her dropping it into the drawer. Mr.Robertson, scheduled for a lobotomy today, Nov 14th, 1914, he said to her. - 1914 ?! I cried out, are you people insane? It\u00b4s 2021 and you cant fucking perform lobotomies on people!\n\nMr. Robertson I do have to insist that you calm yourself down, otherwise we\u00b4re going to have to sedate you. The doctor said, turning his head towards me, giving me a stern look. One of the orderlies went over to a cabinet to my right and unlocked the glass doors, as if to be ready if they needed to make good on their threat. I had to figure out a way to get out of here! I tried to calm myself down and look around the room. It wasn\u00b4t until then I noticed all the people up on the second level, looking down at us. More doctors, young men holding pens and papers, medical students, I assumed. They were all looking at me in a way that you look at a monkey at the zoo. This was how they must feel, I thought. Like a speciment, an experiment waiting to happen.\n\nI continued to scan the room, Dr.Thomas was now standing by the black board, now acually black, and drawing something up while adressing the audience on the second level. I looked to my right, there was the medical cabinet, now with the glass doors open. There where supplies stacked on the shelves inside. Syringes, tubes, and a big bottle of Ethyl Alcohol with a big \u201dflammable\u201d warning on the side. I looked back over at Dr.Thomas who was still writing and drawing on the blackboard while talking loudly to the onlookers. The orderlies had sat down on two chairs to my left, fully enganged in listening to what the doctor was talking about.\n\nI slowly tried to slide my hand out of the restraints. They hadn\u00b4t fastened my right hand as hard as my left, maybe if I... The doctor turned to me, pointing with his whole arm and presented me to the room, I stopped trying to get loose immediatly. One of the big guys in white came over and rolled me in to the center of the room, right next to the operating table. It wasn\u00b4t until then I recognized what was being written on the black board. It was the same description as I had seen last time I was here, the step by step instructions to a lobotomy. My head was spinning, I couldn\u00b4t grasp what was going on, all I knew was that I had to get the hell out of there.\n\nEveryones gaze was yet again focused on Dr.Thomas\u00b4s presentation, and I very stealthly rocked my hand from left to right, finaly! I felt it come loose! I left it like that for now, as to not draw attention to myself. I needed to loosen my left hand as well, but there was no way that that would go unnoticed, i was sitting right in front of at least 10 people. I needed to think!\n\nExcuse me, Dr.Thomas. I said, Would it be possible to turn me around so that I can see what you\u00b4re writing? After all, it is me who is going to get the benefit of this treatment and I think it would be interesting to see how it is done. The doctor turned his head and smiled. There, see, now that you\u00b4ve calmed down you\u00b4re starting to come to your senses. He motionted for one of the orderlies to come and turn me around. I now had my back to the audience and slowly slid my right hand out and quietly, and very carefully, loosened my left hand.\n\nI had just placed my right hand back under the restraints when Dr.Thomas turned to face the room once more.\n\nAnd that\u00b4s about it! He said, Any questions? He was done with his presentation, I didn\u00b4t have long now. I saw the small table I had seen before, now to my left, there it was, the ice pick and the hammer, gleaming in the light. Dr.Thomas got out his pipe while listening to a student asking something, and stuffed it with tobacco once more. From his pocket he presented a box of matches. He lit one up and held it up to his pipe, drawing deep puffs to get it going. The smoke rose towards the ceiling, it had a sweet smell to it. He threw the box of matches down on the table beside me and I knew this was my chance.\n\nAs quickly as I could, I almost flew out of the wheelchair, grabbing the matches as I went. I rushed over to the open medical cabinet and grabbed the bottle of Ethyl Alcohol and held it up in the air. Wait!! Dr. Thomas shouted as the orderlies were about to run over and tackle me. Mr.Robertson, now don\u00b4t do anything hasty here. Remember, we are all here to help you! - Yeah, Well I dont remember asking for your help! I screamed. I am NOT about to let you hammer a fucking ice pick into my skull, you understand?! -Calm down, he said, slowly walking towards me. You don\u00b4t acually think you can just walk out of here, do you? I backed up as he was approching, raising the bottle higher.\n\nStop!! I yelled. Dont come any closer! Out of the corner of my eye I saw the orderlies slowly walking along the wall towards me. An incoherent gasping and mumble was heard from the students and doctors above us. With all my force I threw the bottle on the floor, sending shards of glass flying across the room, the content of the bottle splashing all over. I lit a match, and held it threateningly in the air. I said Stop!! I yelled again. The orderlies looked over to Dr.Thomas for confirmation of what to do. He held his hand in the air. Now be carefull Mr.Robertson, that is highly flammable! Oh I know, I said. You will let me go, or I will burn this fucking place to the ground. You hear me?!\n\nOne of the men in white saw his chance and leaped towards me. His quick movement startled me and dropped the lit match to the floor. A flash of light dazed the room and in a second you could feel the heat licking your skin. The room was ablaze and I turned around and ran. The commotion had gotten the attention of everyone else on the fourth floor, now hurrying to OPR2 to see what had happened and help them put out the fire, but it spread quickly. High flames whipping the ceiling, spreading out into the hallway, floors, walls, everything caught fire. I hurried down the stairs, second floor. All empty, they must have run upstairs I thought. First floor, theres that god damn oil painting of Dr.Thomas, still on the ground with a cracked frame. Wait! I did a double take and looked around, wait.. what?\n\nEverything was back to being abandoned and foresaken, the dust and cobwebs once again had claimed the house. But I could still hear the screaming and commotion from the fourth floor, albeit a bit distorted, like it was alot further away than it acually was. I ran towards the door and saw my camera bags, just where I had left them before everthing started to to take a weird turn, I grabbed them and bolted through the front door. I was outside, and .. I was back in my own clothes! There was my car! I threw my bags in and jumped in after, turned the key and floored it. Gravel shot out from behind my rear tires like a machine gun blazing, ricocheting of the stone angels in the fountain as I took off towards the exit. As I looked in my rearview mirror, the Asylum looked just like it had done when I first came there, but I swear I thought I could see smoke rising from the roof.\n\nI\u00b4m now writing this from my motel room near the interstate. I still have no idea what I just went through. But I think I\u00b4ll have a break from urban exploring for a while. I\u00b4m glad I got out of there without having my brains turned into mashed potatoes, if that shit even acually happened? I don\u00b4t know. There is one thing though, that\u00b4s a bit weird. When I came to the motel they couldn\u00b4t find my registration. It wasn\u00b4t until I told them what room I had gotten a confirmation for that the guy found it. Only..It was registered to a Jeremiah Robertson....","49":"Media, specifically film and  videos has had a significant impact on people's lives ever since their creation. Some people that I've talked to tell me that the movie they can remember seeing the earliest in their childhood were Disney films. The magical stories and tales of love and hope and courage conquering evil.\n\nAnd when these same people are asked about the earliest video they can remember watching when the internet came to be were classic videos such as RoosterTeeth RedVsBlue, The Annoying Orange (I'll never understand why people thought that was funny), band music videos uploaded in 2007 or 2008 such as Linkin Park.\n\nBoth answers have the similarity of somewhat humorous to nostalgic and uplifting. But my earliest memories of films and videos were the opposite. The earliest memory I have of watching a movie was when the scary parts of Snow White. As for the earliest memory of online videos, it was awful. Let's just say it was the first time I ever saw someone legitimately die in video format.\n\nWhat I'm getting at with this long ass intro is to have you understand the effect film and videos have on our minds. They leave a lasting impression whether it good or bad. And that is now where my nightmare comes in.\n\nAbout a year ago I volunteered in a project funded by some branch of the government and headed by psychologists and one man who I'm assuming was a representative of that government branch (quite possibly CIA, I'll never know). The objective of the project was told to me and the other volunteers that this was to see if viewing our dreams would not only be able to help us unlock secrets our unconscious \/subconscious was keeping from our waking minds but also to help us see what needed to be confronted.\n\nIf you've read anything by Freud or by Carl Jung (specifically Carl Jung if I'm being honest), you'll know that dreams are not meaningless. Dreams are a way of our waking minds to repress deep powerful feelings and thoughts our waking conscious does not want to me consciously thinking about and wants it to keep those things buried deep in our unconscious part of our minds whether it be traumatic or taboo or whatever. The unconscious, dreams, hell even the mind still is being figured out to this day.\n\nAnyways, this was to be a major breakthrough not only in psychology but in understanding more about ourselves. And with the obscure tools and method that was used to record all of the volunteers' dreams made that breakthrough possible. But it should've never happened in the first place. Somethings are better left unknown and unseen and unexperienced.\n\nThe complex this took place in was a kind of a colossal 8 story black office building with very dark tinted windows and just gave off this ominous vibe. The whole project took place in this vast dim lit room in the center of the complex on the fourth floor.\n\nThere were two groups of volunteers. One group was to have their dreams, be it odd or nice, to be recorded. The other group that I volunteered to be in, was to have their nightmares recorded.\n\nAfter the dream group finished, we were all invited to watch their dreams on TV in a comfy lounge room, since each dream was recorded onto DVD. Of course, all of the dreams were weird, some cool where the dreamers dreamt of themselves with powers or strange abilities. A couple of them had very sexual dreams but I'm not judging. Yet there were parts that were very glitchy and staticy. Like I'm talking about so bad that it looked like the DVDs were scratched to hell on those recorded parts. But after the DVDs were taken out there wasn't a single smudge on them. Then it was my group's turn.\n\nI was #8, the last one to go for the whole thing. Out in the waiting room, outside of the observation room that had a window looking into where the dreamers slept in, I had this subtle yet gradual building sense of doom inside me as I saw dreamer after dreamer leave the test and observation room sweaty (with cold sweat I assume) and silent. I could see it on all of their faces: they we're unsettled from what they just went through. Something obviously didn't go wrong because if so I wouldn't have been called up when it was my turn.\n\nWhen I stood up I heard one of the young women, by the name of Tessa, tell me \"Good luck, dude.\"  I entered the observation room where the leading psychologist Dr. Thompson reassured me that everything would be fine and that Nurse Jacobs would help me get situated and assist me if in need of anything.\n\nNurse Jacobs, a guy in his late 30s I believe, escorted me into the eerie dimly lit room that was only lit by 4 lamps in each corner. Each lamp had this gloomy orange glow that made the whole room feel like it belonged in a dream itself. In the center of the room was a bed with new sheets and a black headband resting on the pillow. From what I remember Dr. Thompson telling us was that the headband had newly developed technological devices inside it that would be able to record our dreams and nightmares and send the video to the observation room where it would be recorded onto a DVD. Also within the headband was a small device that would cause us to either have a dream or nightmare depending on the group we were in. My case was to have a nightmare of course.\n\nI sat on the bed and Nurse Jacobs gave me a fast-acting sleep aid to swallow and then gently put the surprisingly flexible dream-recording headband onto my head. Then I lied down after pulling the sheets and blankets over me and fell quickly asleep. I didn't remember the nightmare I had, which was the first red flag because every volunteer was able to recount at least some parts of their dreams or nightmares. I couldn't remember a single thing.\n\nWhat I do remember is waking up on the floor with Nurse Jacobs helping me up onto my feet. He asked me if everything was alright and I just nodded my head. After I took off the headband and gave it to him, I walked over to Dr. Thompson in the observation room.\n\n\"Sorry if not much showed up,\" I told Dr. Thompson, \"I can't seem to remember anything from it.\"\n\n\"That's okay, man,\" she replied with a confident smile,\" we still got footage of your nightmare. Recorded right here and just now put onto this DVD we can all watch it on. Come on, let's join the others.\"\n\nWe gathered into the lounge room where we all sat on nice comfortable couches and cushioned seats.\n\n\"I just want to thank you all for volunteering for this project,\" Dr. Thompson told all of us, \"you've helped us learn more of our own minds than mankind ever thought was possible in the 21st century. After analyzing the dreams that the first group had, we've discovered not only does it prove that Jung was onto something but also it gave us a clearer picture of how the unconscious works. But that was just the beginning. Now we get to the gritty stuff. We all know the dreamscape is not just weird, adventurous or sometimes a place where we can live out our sexual fantasies, but that there is its shadow, its much darker and understandably frightening and unsettling shadow. This, my friends, will help us learn even more about ourselves and maybe, just maybe, what lies beyond.\"\n\nThat last part did not sit well with me or any of the other volunteers. Thinking about it now fills me with dread.\n\nDr. Thompson then put in the first DVD of the nightmare group. Something, I don't know what, still blocks me from remembering the recorded nightmares I saw from the other volunteers. All that lingers is the memory of the silence in the air getting even more deathly still, so unnervingly so after each recorded nightmare was finished being watched by all of us until it got to my nightmare.\n\nBut I do remember my recorded nightmare. I remember it vividly. Dr. Thompson put in the last DVD and the screen remained black.\n\nStatic began to fade in and out for a minute until suddenly we saw a dimly lit attic bedroom with a ceiling window that revealed an endless blackness. I remembered that room. I remembered all of it because I had a nightmare of that room years ago. Did I have a reoccurring nightmare or one where I revisited the same area?\n\nThe bedroom had a full sized bed with white sheets, white pillows and a white blanket. A dull colored fuzzy couch that had its back up against the right side of the bed and its front facing the closet (I'll get to the closet soon). The walls were white, I can't remember what type of wallpaper there was exactly. The carpet flooring was rust orange. There was a desk sitting across the room from the bed that had a computer that was off and a desk lamp that had a gloomy yellow glow. I can't remember if the desk had drawers or not. There was a white oak dresser leaning against the same wall the bed did.\n\nThen there was the closet and the TV. Those two gave off the most ominous aura out of the entire scene. First, let me describe the TV. The TV was one of those CRT TVs that sat on a dark wooden TV stand. The TV was on but there was just static.\n\nThe closet had a white stained and painted oak door that was closed. The knob was of the same material too. I remember hoping and praying to whatever god that that closet door wouldn't be opened.\n\nIn the nightmare, there was a young man in the bedroom with me. He was wearing a black t-shirt and baggy dark gray cargo pants. The voice he spoke in seemed normal but felt *off*.\n\n\"Yeah I got some good videos and movies if you want to watch em,\" the man told me.\n\nIn my nightmare I walked over to him when he pointed to this clear Rubbermaid full of VHS tapes and DVDs in white plastic covers that he was standing by. I grabbed a VHS tape and walked over to the TV. The static began to grow louder to a point where it almost sounded like roaring waves in a violent storm at a beach. Once I got to the TV, I heard the closet creak open.\n\nThen it cut to complete blackness and then cut to a scene in the living room of my Aunt and Uncle's house. I was with my cousins and my Aunt and Uncle and we were looking for a movie to watch at night. I remember seeing that same infinite abyss outside the windows of my Aunt and Uncle's house. Their house though was more well lit than that attic bedroom from before. But there was still this unsettling atmosphere despite the scene looking fine.\n\nI picked a DVD of a horror movie. It was like a perfect blend of supernatural, slasher and psychological horror. The cover of the DVD had this pale blue face of a woman with inky black straggly hair, horrifyingly piercing blood red eyes and this terrible expression on her face that gave this sense of timeless otherworldly malevolence.\n\n\"We should watch that one!\" one of my cousins exclaimed with excitement.\n\n\"I don't know,\" I muttered, sounding creeped out and rightfully so.\n\n\"We're watching it,\" my cousin's sister told me as she had me give her the movie to her.\n\nI followed them all into their TV room which was extremely dark. They put the movie in and it jumped right into the action of the horror. No opening credits of course, just right into the frightening shit. And it was terrifying beyond words. My mind won't let me remember it in every tiny detail but there were horrific scenes of the protagonists and their friends being tormented, chased and killed by the thing on the cover of the DVD and other sinister primordial entities.\n\nIt was too much for me in the nightmare, so I began walking to the front door to get out. As I walked to the door, I heard the closet in the hallway begin to creak open. And once I opened the front door, I fell into an infinite abyss.\n\nThat is where the nightmare ended, well that nightmare I should say.\n\nDr. Thompson took out the DVD. She looked down at it and then up to me. I could feel everyone else's eyes locked onto me.\n\n\"You said you didn't remember any of this?\" Dr. Thompson asked me.\n\n\"Yeah, well...\" I said as I shifted uncomfortably in the seat I was in as my blood was still cold from witnessing my own nightmare before my waking eyes.\n\n\"Well what?\"\n\n\"I had two nightmares like that, separate from each other, but ones just like those years ago. Maybe even a decade I think. I can't be sure. But the thing is I don't remember the closet door creaking open.\"\n\n\"Huh, interesting.\" Dr. Thompson looked back down at the DVD of my recorded nightmare. Something was scratching at her mind, I could tell.\n\n\"Can we go home, please?\" one of the volunteers asked Dr. Thompson. Not only himself but I could tell that the rest of the volunteers were highly unsettled by what they just watched.\n\n\"Sure,\" Dr. Thompson replied, \"just wait for Nurse Jacobs to get ready to take you guys home. Oh, by the way, you will all get your own DVD copy of your dreams in the mail in a couple days along with money as payment in return for volunteering.\"\n\nAll of the volunteers went downstairs and then outside into the cold Autumn air to smoke as they waited for Nurse Jacobs to get his things from his locker.\n\nI stood up and Dr. Thompson walked up to me and remarked, \"You know, for some reason your nightmare seem to spook everyone the most. I mean, Clara's nightmare was honestly the most horrifying when it came to subject matter. But yours...well, I won't lie to you, it even made me creeped out despite it being so...I don't know. It feels like it doesn't align with the other nightmares we watched tonight. It's something else, that's for sure. That's all I can say for now about that. Anyways, thanks for being a part of this. It means a lot.\"\n\n\"You're welcome, Dr. Thompson,\" I said as I shook her hand.\n\n\"You should get some rest if you can, after relaxing and maybe some meditation of course. Take care.\"\n\n\"You too, Doctor.\"\n\nI didn't take the elevator and took the stairs instead down to the first floor. Right after I got outside and into the parking lot where the others were, they noticed me and stopped talking about whatever subject they were on.\n\n\"So,\" Tessa said to me and everyone else, \"am I the only one who thought that last one was...wrong?\"\n\n\"No,\" one of the younger men answered. Everyone else shook their heads in reply and looked at me.\n\n\"What about you?\" she asked me.\n\n\"It was weird,\" I answered, still creeped out from what I just watched. \"It was weird and yes, it felt wrong. Something just wasn't right about that. I mean, all those dreams and nightmares you guys had were of ones you had during your turns, right?\"\n\nThey all nodded their heads in response.\n\n\"See,\" I continued, \"the thing is like I said before, I had those two nightmares years ago, separate from each other. But to see them together like that and with those closet doors...\"\n\n\"So I'm not the only one who's fucking freaked out about those closet doors,\" one of the younger men confirmed to himself out loud. \"I mean, come on, we were scared of closet doors as kids and we grew out of that fear after we, you know, grew up. But watching your nightmare, man, that shit brought that old childhood fear back inside me.\"\n\n\"I don't think I want to even remember that movie in your nightmare,\" Tessa told me. \"Now I've seen my fair share of all sorts of horror movies but shit like that makes them all look like Sesame Street, man.\"\n\n\"Do you have an idea what it might mean?\" Clara asked me.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" I told her truthfully, \"I guess maybe something I repressed. But it doesn't make sense why those two nightmares reoccurred in the same nightmare. And again, the closet creaking thing is new, especially the falling part after leaving that house.\"\n\n\"Does that attic bedroom seem familiar?\" Tessa asked me.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"which is weird because at least the house the last part took place in I recognized as my Aunt and Uncle's house. But the attic bedroom...nothing rings any bells.\"\n\n\"Can Nurse Jacobs hurry his slow ass, please?\" Clara said in frustration as she rubbed her arms to get warm. \"It's cold as hell out here.\"\n\nAnd just then Nurse Jacobs walked out of the large ominous black building. He waved us over to his suburban and we all got in.\n\n10 minutes into the drive back to the more populated area of the city, I began to get very sleepy. I should've been wide awake after that whole ordeal, afraid to fall asleep, but I just fell asleep anyways.\n\nI woke up to see the suburban parked in front of my apartment building. The car was empty minus Nurse Jacobs of course. I got out of the car and said goodnight to him. He drove off and I quickly got into my apartment room on the top floor of the building.\n\nMy roommate was asleep with his girlfriend in their bedroom. I quietly got into my bedroom, got undressed and went straight to bed. It took me two hours to finally fall asleep.\n\nAll I remember from the dreams I had were of different closet doors slowly creaking open, revealing a familiar infinite darkness, but with something inside it. Something beyond time and emanating otherworldly malevolence was inside that eternal darkness. And I could feel it watching me.\n\nI woke up drenched in cold sweat and breathing heavily. After I took a nice warm shower and got into fresh new clothes, I got my shoes on and went on a walk and to stop by Tessa's place to see how she was. The sky was mostly clear in the early morning right when the sun was beginning to rise over the horizon. I suddenly saw an ambulance race past me and turn into the neighborhood where Tessa told me she lived at with her boyfriend. My heart sank. Fear gripped my guts tightly.\n\nSo I ran to see, to make sure that the ambulance didn't stop at her house, but it did. Once I got to her house I ran past one of the paramedics and into Tessa's house. The lights were all off and I could hear Tessa's boyfriend, Henry, sobbing and whimpering.\n\n\"Tessa!\" I called out. \"Henry!\"\n\nJust then I saw two paramedics rolling a gurney out of the bedroom with Tessa on it. She wasn't dead, but it looked like it. Her body was frozen in a disturbing contorted state as if rigor mortis set in and her face had the most unsettling horrifying expression of terror. How I knew she was still alive was that I could see her chest still move when she breathed.\n\n\"Sir,\" the paramedic comforting Henry said to me, \"you shouldn't be here.\"\n\n\"I-I'm Tessa's friend,\" I told them.\n\n\"Well can you please wait outside.\"\n\nI nodded and walked outside and sat on the chair at the front porch. A few police officers arrived and went inside as the ambulance drove off with Tessa.\n\nLater, one of the officers came out and asked me a few questions about my relationship with her and if she had any enemies. Then he asked me if I noticed anything strange about her recently. All that came to mind was the dream and nightmare project which I ended up telling him about. After he took all of my information down I was able to ask him what happened to Tessa.\n\n\"From what her boyfriend told us,\" the officer said, \"he remembers hearing her screaming late at night when he saw that their closet door was open. Then he seemed to blackout. Woke up later to find her like...you saw her, so yeah, he found her like that on the floor. Even though her boyfriend and herself appears to have no drugs or alcohol in the house, we're still going to see if there were any drugs in her system, just to be sure.\"\n\nSuddenly I heard his radio go off with who I'm assuming was dispatch reporting another incident.\n\n\"What a way to start the fucking morning,\" the officer sighed and then responded to dispatch, \"copy that.\"\n\n\"What's going on?\" I asked him.\n\n\"I wish I knew. Got another one about a mile from here.\"\n\n\"Another what?\"\n\n\"Another person ended up like your friend, Tessa. A guy found his friend on the bedroom floor this morning like that. You wouldn't happen to know who he is, would you?\"\n\nA sudden sense of immense dread bloomed like a monstrous flower inside me as I realized what was going on. \"Oh shit, that can't be it,\" I said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I gotta make a phone call real quick,\" I told the officer.\n\nI walked onto the sidewalk and called Nurse Jacobs who quickly picked up.\n\n\"Nurse Jacobs?\" I asked once he picked up.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I could hear him respond with a shuddering.\n\n\"Have you heard from Dr. Thompson?\"\n\n\"She's in the ER. Not only that but so are the other psychologists who were with us. Where are you right now?\"\n\n\"Tessa's house.\"\n\nA minute of eerie silence that felt longer than it really was.\n\n\"Nurse Jacobs\" I asked, noticing that he wasn't saying anything, \"does this have to do with what we watched last night? The nightmares?\"\n\n\"Yours.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\"\n\n\"The DVDs of the recorded dreams and nightmares are all still at Dr. Thompson's house but yours is missing. The original copy and the copy you were supposed to receive.\"\n\n\"Who could've taken them?\"\n\n\"I don't know. The strange thing is that Dr. Thompson's wife didn't see or hear anyone enter their house or even Dr. Thompson's office. Police checked to see if there were any signs of forced entry but there were none. I can't explain it. I don't know what's happening. This doesn't make any sense. I got to help the situation here at the hospital right now. Later when I get the time, we should talk.\"\n\nI agreed and Nurse Jacobs hung up.\n\nLater that month I was able to talk to Nurse Jacobs over dinner. We tried to come up with theories to rationally explain what had happened, but nothing was able to make sense of it all. We're still in touch and we go out together sometimes, when he gets time off that is. As for everyone who watched my recorded nightmare, they were moved to a different hospital to be taken care of. They're still alive somehow, but frozen like that. I don't know where that other hospital is but not even Jacobs knows where they moved them. Nobody will tell us anything.\n\nHenry moved out of the city. Dr. Thompson's wife moved into a different house and into a place that was void of closets. I don't blame her. After all that has happened I've actually developed a fear of closets as well. That old childhood fear returned but in a new dreadful form.\n\nFor almost a year now, I've been having nightmares of closet doors slowly creaking open to reveal that same infinite horrifying darkness with those intangible eyes glaring at me. And I fall into that endless abyss and hear an overwhelmingly petrifying sound similar to the screeching drone of bells and screams of terror intertwined with low ominous humming.\n\nMy nightmare is out there. It's being watched and it's taking people, I know it. I can feel it. I think it wants me to know what it's doing. I can feel it now, watching me from the darkness of my closet and from the darkness beyond.","50":"I honestly thought my fianc\u00e9e was kidding when she first told me about her crazy mom.\n\n*\u201cWhats that babe, you're the daughter of a five-hundred-year-old witch? And she set you up in an arranged marriage to Beelzebub, one of the seven princes of Hell? Shit, I hate it when that happens...\u201d*\n\nForty-eight hours later we were hauling ass down the interstate in a beige Saturn Coupe, me at the wheel, getting tailed by my (prospective) mother-in-law, Agatha, who\u2019d transformed into a Werebat in desperate attempt to stop our wedding.\n\nAlex was in the passenger\u2019s seat, frantically punching our destination into Google maps. We\u2019d shaken off mumsy about six miles back but knew she couldn\u2019t be far, since the horrible old fossil seemed to have a way of tracking us.\n\nThe headlights briefly illuminated a set of giant wings. A moment later, the car noticeably sunk as something hefty planted itself on the roof. Alex and I exchanged a look.\n\nA leathery claw engulfed the side window, and squinting in the rear-view mirror I saw a pair of talony-feet. Alex screamed, \u201cLook out,\u201d as we almost swerved into the desert.\n\nI wasn\u2019t used to driving under such trying conditions\u2026\n\nTwo days earlier our relationship had been much simpler\u2014the most stressful decision we faced was what to binge on Netflix.

Curved nails clamped around Alex\u2019s neck, drawing thin trickles of blood.\n\nFirst, her head disappeared, then her shoulders, and her upper torso, as she got hauled out of the cabin. At the very last second I hooked a pair of flailing legs, letting the vehicle drift across two empty lanes.\n\nAlex rasped something vaguely similar to, \u201cJason\u2026crucifix\u2026\u201d\n\nEyes off the road, I popped the glove compartment and then shoved a silver cross into her outstretched hand.\n\nShe raised it above the roof, and next thing there\u2019s this sound, like a viper hiss, followed by this *other* sound, like Sunday morning bacon on the grill. Alex recited a Bible verse\u2014Mark 1:23-26, for any aspiring exorcists out there\u2014then her mom took flight.\n\nThe unexpected shift in weight caused the car to veer from one side of the road to the other. I jammed on the breaks, fighting to regain control, and was thrown into the dashboard, Alex still half-trapped outside.\n\nWe came to a stop at an extreme angle against the highway, smoke billowing from the wheels. My beautiful fianc\u00e9 slumped into her seat, breathing heavily, and picked glass out of her hair. There was a moment of calm, in which we both sighed then pushed our foreheads together, grinned, and said, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nBut before we could kiss, a silhouette swooped from left to right in the side mirror.\n\nThe engine muttered to life, then we were back on course.\n\nSeven years ago, if you\u2019d told me attending a Halloween party dressed as Ziggy Stardust would ultimately land me on a witches shit-list, I might have worn my Buzz Lightyear costume instead. Or perhaps I\u2019d have stayed home altogether.\n\nAlex was by the punchbowl, dressed as Jareth the Goblin King. I walked up behind her and said, \u201cWell this is awkward, one of us is gonna have to change.\u201d\n\nWhen she flashed that killer smile, my heart got all tingly. If you\u2019d told me *then* that I\u2019d have to stare down the forces of the underworld just to be with her, I\u2019d have said: bring it on, bitch.\n\nWe talked until morning, first about our mutual love of Bowie, then life in general. I fell for her hard. She told me her parents died when she was young (which they did, it just didn\u2019t stick in her mother\u2019s case) but other than that, didn\u2019t say much about her childhood.\n\nI always knew Alex was *the one*, that we\u2019d get married someday, it\u2019s just neither of us felt the need to rush things.\n\nBut her mom\u2019s unexpected resurrection really lit a fire under our asses.\n\nAlex\u2019s phone soon announced we\u2019d arrived at our destination. The neon sign above the parking lot said \u2018Wedding Chapel\u2019.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure this\u2019ll work?\u201d I asked, pulling up as close to the entrance as possible. The lights flashed blue and yellow through the windshield.\n\n\u201cPositive,\u201d she replied. \u201cIf I\u2019m already married, that means moms reneged on her side of the deal. Elder demons don\u2019t take kindly to witches who break their oaths. You still got the rings?\u201d\n\nI fumbled through my pockets. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s do this.\u201d\n\nInside there was a bored receptionist flicking through a copy of US Weekly.\n\nAlex said, \u201cWe wanna get married.\u201d\n\nWithout looking up, the lady casually replied, \u201cThere\u2019s a couple already in there but you can go right after. Packages start at $249 with the *Love Me Tender* option but we have a special on\u2014\u201d\n\nAlex slammed a roll of twenties on the counter. \u201cWe wanna get married NOW.\u201d\n\nThe receptionist eyeballed the cash, eyeballed Alex, then waved us along.\n\nWe raced through a set of double doors, into a room with two rows of wooden benches, a stained-glass window curved at the top, and an altar surrounded by three people: a bride, a groom, and Elvis Presley. (An impersonator, I should clarify, not the real Elvis. That would just be ridiculous.)\n\nIn the corner, an elderly lady wearing a snakeskin dress was stooped over a tiny keyboard.\n\nEverybody snapped their heads towards us at once.\n\nAs we raced down the aisle, Elvis stepped forward, opening his mouth to protest, but before he could get a word in Alex said to the couple, \u201cWe wanna get married and we\u2019re kinda in a hurry. I\u2019ll give you five hundred bucks to leave right now.\u201d\n\nShe counted out the notes and waved the stack around while my right leg bounced up and down. It was hard to gauge Elvis\u2019s expression through the star-shaped sunglasses, but he looked somewhat shocked.\n\nThe couple threw each other a look, then conferred privately.\n\n\u201cSix hundred,\u201d the bride said.\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d Alex and I replied. She counted out five more twenties and stuffed the pile into the bride\u2019s hands, then ushered the couple back to the entrance.\n\nI said to Elvis, \u201cWe need to get married pronto. Finish the ceremony in under five minutes and I\u2019ll give you a fat bonus. Deal?\u201d\n\nThe keyboardist lit a cigarette and glared at me through a cloud of smoke. A pattern of blue-green veins stood out on her upper thigh, similar to the digital roads we\u2019d navigated on Alex\u2019s phone.\n\nElvis looked me up and down, debating whether I was serious. \u201cNow listen here, partner, I\u2019m gonna need to see\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cRight here.\u201d I unfolded a marriage license, newly issued by the state of Nevada.\n\nAt the far side of the room, Alex dragged a wooden bench across the double doors, grunting from the effort.\n\nElvis inspected the license, then said, \u201cYou got any identif\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSure do.\u201d I offered him two driver\u2019s licenses: mine and Alex\u2019s.\n\nHe gave them a once over, shrugged, then shot finger guns at the keyboardist. Cigarette still in mouth she nodded curtly, then started a soulful rendition of \u2018here comes the bride\u2019.\n\nI leaned close to Elvis and said, \u201cWhatever happens, don\u2019t stop the ceremony.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh-hu-hu,\u201d he replied.\n\nAlex, having zero interest in absorbing the magical moment, bolted down the aisle to join us at the altar.\n\nElvis raised his arms, in a gesture resembling the Nixon peace symbol. \u201cWell here we are in the city of lights Las Vegas, Nevada, gathered today to celebrate\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cUhh\u2026King,\u201d Alex interrupted. \u201cCould we maybe get the abridged version?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got it little missy.\u201d He gyrated his hips. \u201cMarriage is two hearts of one love. A promise, to communicate and care to love one another, to be not only each other\u2019s lovers, but, most importantly\u2026Elvis's lover.\u201d\n\nA tiny speaker in the ceiling emitted a faint *ba-dum-tish*.\n\n\u201cBut seriously folks, the road of life is best travelled together, and\u2014\u201d\n\nI rotated my finger.\n\nAfter double-checking my license, Elvis said, \u201cJason, please take\u201d\u2014he double-checked Alex\u2019s\u2014\u201cAlex by the hand. Look her in the eyes and say I, Jason, take thee, Alex, to be my lawfully wedded wife.\u201d\n\nI looked into her eyes, those shining, emerald eyes, feeling her rapid pulse between my fingers. As I repeated the vows she chewed her lip, the way she always does when anxious.\n\nElvis continued his speel, only making it so far as, \u201cTo have and to hold,\u201d before a sharp hiss, coming from behind the window, stole his attention.\n\n\u201cHey, King,\u201d I snapped my fingers. \u201cIf you want that bonus you\u2019ve gotta do this fast. Let\u2019s go, chop chop.\u201d\n\n\u201cUhh, to have and to hold from this day forward.\u201d\n\nAnother shriek, louder than the first.\n\n\u201c\u2014have and to hold from this day forward,\u201d I repeated.\n\n\u201cIn sickness and in health.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014sickness and health.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo love and to cherish.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014love and to cherish.\u201d\n\n\u201cTill death do us part.\u201d\n\n\u201cTill death do us\u2014\u201d\n\nBefore I could finish, a huge silhouette suddenly filled the window, then Agatha exploded through the glass, claws poised, and glided straight towards us.\n\n[Things were about to get wild\u2026](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/thoughtindustry\/)","51":"I grew up in a desert with my father who's profession was of transportation. Father was alcoholic and would stay away from home for days because of his work. I usually stayed with my neighbors, an Old Guy with lots of stories to make me fall asleep. The old guy used to convince me that he had some encounters with ghosts during his early age and made me curious in this subject.\n\nI am 22 years old now and just finished my college. I was reading a newspaper article about solo road trips which made me feel excited. So I packed my bag and headed down south direction of the desert. Its going to be midnight soon and I have completely drained down all my energy driving through this road. Luckily I found an hotel where I can take a small rest.\n\nUpon reaching the hotel, I glared at the place and saw that it was quite an old, dusted hotel and appears to fall the moment I enter in. There was a huge board with the name written over it as \"Old Liberty Hotel\". To give an impression about the place, there is a big gate behind which there is a fountain but without the water and behind that we have a 4-storey medieval styled building spanning good chunk of area. I entered the hotel and in reception I find a lady in her mid-thirties welcoming me. I booked a single-bed room. The receptionist handed me a key for room no. 401 with a very cheeky smile.\n\nUnbothered, I took my bag and stood in front of elevator door and pressed the button, to which the receptionist without even facing me spoke in a very slow and cold tone \"Unavailable\". Disappointed, I started scaling heights with a heavy luggage. Finally, reached to my floor, it was good, decent and peaceful passage. I entered the keys in the lock and turned around but I guess the lock was so rusted and was unwilling to turn. Finally it got unlocked and I proceeded in. I closed the door, and kept my luggage down, when I turned away from the door, I heard Elevator bell ring indicating that its working. I blamed my luck and jumped in my bed without even turning the lights on and started facing the ceiling.\n\nSuddenly, piano tune started to be heard from my adjacent room. The music was calm and relaxing so there was nothing to cripple about and was the sole reason I slept automatically. In the middle of the night, huge scream was responsible for waking me up. The same room which was melodious an hour ago is now tearing my ear drum now. The lady was screaming with immense pain and to just check whether everything is ok, I rushed to the door and turned the knob but the knob was determined to not rotate even an inch. Interestingly the scream stopped and there was pin drop silence in the entire room. Breathing a sigh of relief, I returned to my bed but now an infant was heard crying and then the women started crying, it was an utter chaos, that I decided to call the receptionist. I took up the dialer just to hear beeps indicating the telephone doesn't work. I slammed the dialer and again the noise got dampened. I took my pillow and covered my ears and returned to sleep. Next morning, I was completely exhausted because of no sleep, I took my luggage and headed to the reception for checkout. Fortunately the door knob unlocked and also the elevator worked. I reached the reception but found no one there, so I agreed to patiently wait for someone.\n\nThere was a news paper stand with only one newspaper hanging over the stand. I took it up to read and pass my time, there my eyes caught an interesting title reading \"*Husband strangled his wife and drowned his baby*\". Feeling disgusted, I started to read the article which proceeded as \"*A drug addict husband in a fit of rage over an argument with his wife drowned his 2 month old child. The husband later strangled his wife and also mutilated both her wife and child in order to make them unrecognizable by anyone. He was later arrested by the police authority where he revealed that the husband was angry over her wife for playing piano in a Hotel and keeping their child away from him. He was sensing that the wife was cheating on him.*\" Reading this I found some resemblance and my blood went cold when I read the last line \"*This whole incident occurred at Old Liberty Hotel where the women used to work and stay there with her child\"* The paper slipped from my hands and my eyes starred straight in front of the reception where keys are hanged. There was no key holder with number \"402\"","52":"[Block A](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qpr9aa\/event_apartments_block_a\/) | [Block B](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qqhazb\/event_apartments_block_b\/)  \n\u201cTonya hated apartment block C.\u201d Edi said softly into the silence that followed Badr\u2019s story. Bailey stumbled over to sit by his brother, looping an arm around his shoulder and sagging down onto the chairs.\n\nEdi wrung her hands slightly and looked toward one of the windows, as if she expected Tonya to come in at any minute.\n\n\u201cNot at first! I mean\u2026 I don\u2019t think. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d have gone back if she\u2019d hated it at first. It had to have been exciting and fun, didn\u2019t it? We had some good times, didn\u2019t we? Remember when we found that cat and her kittens? Or the time we made that rope swing off the stairs?\u201d To me it seemed more like she was trying to convince herself than trying to convince the rest of us.\n\nBut she was right. I did remember all those things. I remembered riding our bikes up and down the stairs, too, and mattresses and a thousand other ill-advised things we were probably too old for but had done anyway.\n\nI also remembered the time Kai and Tonya had piled a bunch of chairs and mattresses and junk in the swimming pool and tried to light it all on fire. Thank god they\u2019d never succeeded.\n\nWe\u2019d been in that lawless age between real children and actual human beings. The age range I like to think of as the sociopath years, when the brain is in that short stage of development where you\u2019re basically a small dinosaur fueled by spite and hormones.\n\nI looked at Erica and wondered what she was making of all this. Her husband-to-be\u2019s childhood friends and siblings. Maybe she thought we were all insane. I wouldn\u2019t have blamed her. It seemed pretty crazy to me.\n\n\u201cI think she told me why, afterwards, but I thought she was making it up to scare me- so I wouldn\u2019t want to go into the C\u2019s either anymore.\u201d Edi\u2019s gaze slid to the floor and I felt a pang of hard sympathy for her. Losing Tonya and Mischa had been hard, but it must have been worse for her and the brothers.\n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine losing a sibling like that.\n\n\u201cDo you remember when we found the basement?\u201d She wound her arms up and laced her fingers together before pushing them away from her face as far as she could reach, still tangled.\n\n\u201cKind of.\u201d Oliva spoke for the first time. She\u2019d been quiet throughout Badr\u2019s story. I looked at her, a little surprised, because for a second I\u2019d forgotten she was there. In the room with us. She was still sitting in the corner with her glass in hand, looking as remote and unreachable as a movie star.\n\n\u201cI remember the machines.\u201d She added.\n\nEdi nodded and hugged herself.\n\n\u201cThe washing machines, yeah. And the dryers. There were so many of them. I can\u2019t imagine why. That basement was almost as big as the whole building. They must have had a washer and dryer for every apartment in the complex.\u201d She gave a little nervous laugh that worried me.\n\nIt was easy enough to picture the basement. We\u2019d been in that apartment block so many times. It was the first we\u2019d infiltrated and essentially \u2018home base\u2019 for when we were exploring. With the gap in the fence that we used to get in and out right beside it, it only made sense.\n\nShe was right about the number of machines, though. A ludicrous amount of them. And rows and rows of pale fluorescent lights that made the tiled walls and floor look like a dry pool.\n\n\u201cAnd someone had left all those slipcovers down there.\u201d Piles and piles of them in big mounds that were heaped across some of the machines and at the ends of aisles. I could vividly recall the plasticy scent of them and the juxtaposition of the ugly brown florals against the off color whites.\n\n\u201cThere was this time we played hide and seek.\u201d An immediate warning bell went off in the back of my mind when those words left her lips, \u201cTonya thought it would be a great idea to hide in the slip covers. And, I mean, it probably was\u2026 until the breathing started.\u201d\n\nI had a visceral reaction, given my own history in apartment block A. All the hair on my body stood on end.\n\n\u201cShe said she could hear it somewhere behind her. At first she thought it was one of us, but when she tried to get out of the pile she couldn\u2019t. It was just slipcovers- as if she\u2019d turned around and gone the wrong way, except they never ran out. There wasn\u2019t a wall or a end anywhere, and everywhere she went it seemed like the breathing got louder until she felt the plastic start to wind around her, weigh her down, suffocate her-\u201d\n\nThis part I remembered with a suddenness that shocked me.\n\n*I opened one of the dryers*. I was looking for a place to hide myself and figured no one would ever find me. But Tonya was already there, tangled up with an old slipcover someone had left behind. She was hyperventilating and screaming- and I was confused by that, because I hadn\u2019t heard her screams before I opened the dryer.\n\nI helped her out, obviously, but we ended up having to cut the slip cover off of her. It had become knotted and tangled in such a way that there was no other way to get it off. Thank goodness most of us carried pocket knives.\n\nI got her upper half free and she frantically helped me do the rest, and then we both ran out of the basement because after a second I could hear it too. The breathing. It seemed like it was coming from everywhere at once. Not just the slipcovers but the washers and dryers too.\n\nHalfway up the stairs I remember her looking back and nearly tripping. I, being the slowest, didn\u2019t dare. A mistake like that had already nearly cost me my life once. But once we got to the top and I had a second to catch my breath, I asked her what she\u2019d seen.\n\nShe said she\u2019d seen a lady draped in one of the slipcovers climbing out of the dryer.\n\nSpooked me good, I will admit. I avoided the basement for the rest of our childhoods, even when the reason *why* had become a kind of ghost story that I only half believed. Things like that didn\u2019t actually happen, after all. It was just a confused girl who\u2019d given herself a serious scare.\n\nI tuned back in to what Edi was saying and listened with grim surprise while she finished.\n\n\u201cShe said the lady was always there every time we went back. Standing at the bottom of the basement stairs, with more and more of them every time. And she was scared that the lady could appear under any of the slipcovers in the block. That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t want to go in there anymore. Especially after Kia and block D.\u201d\n\nGod. That made my blood run cold- if the shroud lady had been anything like the one we\u2019d found in Block D. And the idea she\u2019d been watching us all that time and we\u2019d never known. Maybe just waiting for one of us to be alone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d forgotten half of this.\u201d I said, mostly to myself- but I wasn\u2019t surprised to see Olivia and Bailey nodding, either. Edi shifted her weight and smoothed her hair back with both palms, refusing to make eye contact with any of us.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us forgot what happened to Kai.\u201d She suggested in a soft voice.\n\nShe was right. I certainly never had.","53":"[I](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qil8lh\/i_participated_in_a_group_study_involving_a\/)\n[II](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qjf42b\/i_participated_in_a_group_study_involving_a\/)\n[III](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qks6t2\/i_participated_in_a_group_study_involving_a\/)\n[IV](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qnr0br\/i_participated_in_a_group_study_involving_a\/)\n[V](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qofr51\/i_participated_in_a_group_study_involving_a\/)\n[VI](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qrbjr0\/i_participated_in_a_group_study_involving_a\/)\n\nIn the center of some sort of indoor courtyard, around me were numerous house structures built into the walls like venues, small shops around the corner of a typical shopping center. But I wasn\u2019t standing in a mall, from what I could tell. More like the fa\u00e7ade of an outside neighborhood, except inside, and with a peculiar sense, underground even. Buildings within a building. It was so empty, so quiet\u2026\n\nEach front porch of the different \u2018houses\u2019 set themselves apart from one another in color all the way to size and material. Some wooden, some brick. As I walked down a long, seemingly endless corridor, I peeked into every other home through the front windows, seeing that they each held their own unique interior. But they were empty. The only objects that I could perceive were the occasional chandeliers, stair railings in the ones with more than one level, and carpeted or sometimes plywood flooring. Each house told its own story. Yet, there were so many. How many houses had I been in to truly remember them all? My subconscious couldn\u2019t be making it up.\n\n\u201c*Travis, are you okay?*\u201d Jennifer asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m still here,\u201d I responded. \u201cI\u2019m in some weird place. It\u2019s like a neighborhood inside of an underground mall or something. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n*\u201cDo they still look like set designs?\u201d*\n\n\u201cYeah, but more\u2026 I don\u2019t know, detailed. More precise.\u201d\n\nI continued down the endless avenue of empty homes, glancing over my shoulder every other moment.\n\n\u201cAre you still taking notes?\u201d I had to ask.\n\n\u201c*Only if it\u2019s okay with you? Off-the-book,\u201d* Jennifer said. \u201c*As of now, anyways.*\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have my utmost consent.\u201d\n\nI then stumbled across a particular home with a brick red exterior, with a house number \u20184747.\u2019\n\nThat was the one.\n\nThe door was left open. Taking another deep breath, preparing myself, I carefully approached the front porch, noticing a small table and two chairs in front of the window, and stepped inside the recreation of my childhood home. \n\nAs with my experience in Aunt Deborah\u2019s home, the Hub filled in every single detail to the brim. There was some furniture \u2013 a couch, armoire, artificial plants, the kitchen table directly ahead, parallel to the kitchen just to the side of it, and the sliding glass door to the backyard. \n\nAstoundingly, there was sunlight seeping through the windows of the sliding door into the house, indicating that there was an outside after all, just not from the other end. Then I remembered, the Hub was strange like that. It defied usual laws of physics.\n\nExploring the house gave an odd sense of familiarity, as though I knew my way around just fine despite having not stepped foot into the place since forever ago. The giant CRT TV in the living room entertainment center showed its age, reminding me just how old I was compared to when we were living in the house. \n\nWhen I entered the dining area, I noticed a small birthday cake that sat atop the table. I for sure didn\u2019t see it there before when I first stepped foot inside. As I got a closer look at it, I counted six candles sticking into the cake in a circular pattern, the words \u2018Happy Birthday Travis\u2019 transcribed into the surface with icing. This was the year before, I came to understand. This was exactly a year before the incident. Before my seventh birthday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in my childhood home,\u201d I said to Jennifer. \u201cIn perfect detail. I remember\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c*What do you see now?*\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cThe kitchen. The living room. Everything. I can remember just where everything was like it was yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201c*As you may already have noticed, Travis, every time you go into the Hub, old dormant neural pathways open back up, increasing each time.\u201d*\n\n\u201cI remember more and more every time I go in,\u201d I acknowledged.\n\n\u201c*Yes.*\u201d\n\nThe candles on the cake were lit, waiting to be blown out. As the birthday boy, I went ahead and did the honor. I watched as the smoke vanished into thin air. Was that a memory that I was seeing right now, I wondered? The strings of smoke floating? The smell of the candles being blown out? Or was it something my mind was consciously making up as we go? Could my mind really be capable of remembering every single thread of smoke dissolving into nothingness? I walked away to avoid being bothered more by the question.\n\nUpstairs was my room. There wasn\u2019t much to it from what I saw. A bare carpeted room with just a small Batman-themed bed in the corner, a tiny table and chairs on the opposite side, and scattered toys onto the floor, each with their own indiscernible shape. Like with the other objects I\u2019d seen through memories from the Hub, staring at the objects too hard might drive me crazy trying to pick out exactly what they were. Might\u2019ve been blocks, might\u2019ve been G.I. Joes, coloring books even. They were just toys, I had to tell myself. That\u2019s all. No need to pick out every detail. \n\nPerhaps my old room looked so bare now was due to it being such a distant memory. If my dad was truly a neurosurgeon, as my mother had told me, I have no doubt they could afford to put together my childhood dream bedroom.\n\nI stepped over to the window and stared down at the sidewalk just outside the house. There he was, standing there peering back at me. The dark figure\u2019s face remained concealed from me as before, either from the trick of light or given that he was too far away. Even from the first encounter with him, however, I remembered that up close I was still unable to get a good look at his face. I began to contemplate, in a frightening suggestion, that this was all a waste of time. That there was no way I can be sure that I remember his face at all, if I\u2019d even seen it. What if he wore a mask to protect his identity the whole time I was with him?\n\nFor two whole weeks?!\n\nI had to have laid eyes upon his own at some point. He couldn\u2019t hide it from me forever, I figured. At some point he\u2019d have to-\n\nSuddenly, a stark realization had come over me. This wasn\u2019t a dream. This wasn\u2019t a work of my imagination to fill in the blanks. None of those things were possible in the Hub\u2026\n\nThis was all real. An actual memory. Me standing here in my childhood home, staring down through the window, noticing the man watching me from afar\u2026 this was just a recap. Nothing was being influenced by a trick of the Caduceus controlling objects or people as though they were puppets. It could replicate things to the best of its ability by making a theme out of it \u2013 the \u2018imitation\u2019 of actual environments. But the events were all the same, just as real as they\u2019d been years ago. And as I stood here staring back at the kidnapper, it all hit me at once.\n\nRight here and right now, this was the moment I first met the man in black, not at the movie theater on the night of my birthday. He\u2019d been watching me the whole time. A whole year prior \u2013 a crime in the making. \n\nThe dark figure began to move, headed directly towards the house. I watched as he disappeared from the view of the window and made his way to the front door.\n\nI rushed outside of the room and into the hall. There was the bathroom directly ahead, the one I\u2019d used all the time. It was specifically for me since it was also the closest to my room. I went inside and shut the door, turning on the light. In the reflection of the mirror stood not myself, but my younger six-year-old self. I couldn\u2019t be entirely sure, but it had to be around that age. It looked just like me, matching my every movement with my head and hands as I tested it.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a memory. It couldn\u2019t be. It wasn\u2019t possible for things to act independently on their own, or so I thought.\n\n\u201cCan you talk to me?\u201d I asked my younger self. The past \u2018me\u2019 in the mirror shyly nodded. \n\nSo I was wrong. I could communicate with my other self. But how? The memory with Tyler \u2013 the game of hide-and-go-seek \u2013 that wasn\u2019t a trick of the imagination, was it? It was an actual memory. It had to be. But when I called his name in the Hub, he responded to me in real time, as though he were actually there. I didn\u2019t quite understand\u2026\n\n\u201cHow do we stop him?\u201d I asked.\n\nBut the kid in the reflection doubtfully shook his head.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he quietly spoke. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do what he says\u2026 he\u2019ll punish us.\u201d\n\n*He\u2019ll punish us*.\n\nJust like it was yesterday, the memories came flooding back all at once, in the fraction of a second, and to my detriment, I fully understood what he\u2019d meant by \u2018punish.\u2019 My worry and fear soon transformed into anger.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t do it again,\u201d I promised. \u201cNot to anyone. I need to catch him. Tell me, how do I catch him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to play hide-and-go-seek,\u201d my younger self answered. \u201cThat\u2019s his favorite game.\u201d\n\nI felt a sick twist in my stomach. God, is that what we did all those years ago? With Tyler? \n\n\u201cYou have to count down from ten,\u201d myself in the mirror clarified. \u201cOnce you\u2019re ready, you have to say, \u2018Ready or not- \u201c\n\n\u201cHere I come,\u201d I said with my reflection. \n\nI knew exactly what the deal was. It\u2019d be just like old times\u2026\n\nI stepped back from the mirror, rubbing my face and scratching my head as I braced myself. I took more steady deep breaths to stay calm, hoping that I hadn\u2019t gone into full shock by now on Jennifer\u2019s end. I hadn\u2019t heard from her in a bit, but I wasn\u2019t too worried this time.\n\nI closed my eyes and prepared to start the game.\n\n\u201c10,\u201d I sounded off. \u201c9\u2026 8\u2026 7\u2026 6\u2026 5\u2026 4\u2026 3\u2026 2\u2026\u201d I took in one last deep breath before completing the countdown. \u201cOne! Ready or not\u2026 here I come.\u201d\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI opened the bathroom door and stepped into a different setting entirely. A wide curvy corridor with white walls and a carpeted floor with a design congruent to that of vintage arcades and movie theaters, the same as the movie theater that I\u2019d been snatched from. Rainbow confetti-style art plastered randomly about in different parameters across the floor. \n\nBefore, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to even recognize this place. But I knew exactly where I was now. An old indoor children\u2019s amusement center my parents took me one time. I stepped cautiously through the windy path, closely monitoring every small blind spot I passed from each wide arc in the walls. \n\nRunning footsteps sounded from behind. I jerked my head back only to find no one there. \n\n\u201c*T\u2026 T-Travis,*\u201d Jennifer\u2019s voice came into my ear, making me jump.\n\n\u201cJennifer?\u201d I responded.\n\n\u201c*Travis, can you hear me?*\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, just fine.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Where are you? Are you safe?*\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about safe,\u201d I remarked as I continued down the wall, watching my back at the same time.\n\n\u201c*That\u2019s not funny.*\u201d\n\nIt was comforting, though, knowing that she was here with me, in a since. Her voice alone kept me afloat.\n\n\u201cIf I panic, if my heart starts running a hundred miles per hour, don\u2019t pull me out until I say so,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201c*I know this isn\u2019t what you want to hear, Travis, but I can\u2019t do that,*\u201d she firmly stated. \u201c*I can\u2019t risk your life like that.*\u201d\n\n\u201cJennifer, I have to see him. I have to.\u201d\n\n\u201c*I know but-* \u201c\n\nThe transmission between her and I got cut off again, and all around me followed heavy silence. \n\n\u201cShit,\u201d I muttered.\n\nI heard more footsteps running ahead from out of my view. Swallowing nervously, I stepped over to the echoing sound, not having anything but my hands to defend myself with. When I reached around the corner of the hall towards the source of the noise, I was met with the end of the hall and two wide purple double doors. They were cartoonishly structured in shape and size, almost like something out of a *Candy Land* set.\n\nEntering through the other side, a huge space of various playsets, ranging from miniature houses, castles, a small kitchen set, fun-sized animals such as tortoises and horses, trampolines, bounce houses, monkey bars, and an array of many more objects I couldn\u2019t process all at once. Some of them I remembered from when my parents brought me here years ago. \n\nI stepped along the giant rug laid out into a pathway decorated with rocks and a small creek, leading me through the giant playroom. Why was I here, though? What relevance did this place have to finding the-\n\nThen it hit me again. I had to keep reminding myself that this wasn\u2019t a simulation. Not all the time, anyways. This was my subconscious. This was my memory. He was here.\n\nI had to remember. I had to focus hard \u2013 closing my eyes \u2013 had to try my best to dig and remember the exact moment I spotted him those many years ago. Starting back from the theater, the house looking through the window, and then here\u2026\n\nGot it.\n\nI crept over to the playground area, about the same size as one you\u2019d see at any regular outdoor park. I climbed up the ladder leading to the three-foot platform, crossing over to the slide. I carefully stepped forward, squatting down slowly so I could peek my head into the opening, getting a good look through the tube.\n\nNo one there. Is that where I saw him? I thought so.\n\nI stood back up, and across the distance by the giant porcelain giraffe, I saw him standing there behind, only able to see his head and feet as the rest of his body was blocked from my view. The bastard was behind me the whole time. I walked right past him on my way in.\n\nThe son of a bitch started running away, heading for another closed off play area, \u201cOceanville.\u201d Having no other time to take the ladder or jump over, I headed down the slide, which was surprisingly enough space for me to even fit, and raced after him. He disappeared into the Oceanville section, and once I followed inside the closed-off square shortly after, he was gone. I was only met with porcelain aquatic animals this time. Could he be hiding behind the blue whale? The orca? Maybe even the yellow submarine?\n\nI wasn\u2019t going to bother falling into any of his traps. Jennifer mentioned before that I didn\u2019t have to see something I didn\u2019t want to. So I decided that I didn\u2019t want to keep playing this game.\n\nI closed my eyes tightly, focusing not on a single word, but every thought about the man that I could muster. His height, size, what he might smell like, how he sounded. Whatever it took to get him closer to me.\n\nWhen I opened them again, I was met with an entirely different place once more. An empty space that I could only describe as once being a library, ripped of most of its furniture and appliances. Only the check-out desk with a small Gateway 2000 model monitor propped on the end, screen entirely black, and a few bare, dusty bookcases stood present. The floor was partially carpeted with missing squares and badly damaged material. He was gone.\n\n\u201cDammit!\u201d I hissed.\n\nBut I quickly regained myself, as I realized where I was. The old public library back in Florida. He\u2019d been here to. Again, I just had to remember where it was\u2026\n\nIn the far corner stood multiple bookcases apart from the scarce amount on the side in which I stood, its own personal labyrinth. I\u2019d have to go in. He\u2019d be waiting.\n\nTurning into the first row of bookcases leading into the maze, I noticed that these shelves weren\u2019t vacant like the others. There were rows upon rows of books lined neatly against each other, filled to the end of the shelf. I tried looking closely to see the titles or even authors of the uniquely colored reading materials, but alas, I knew that wouldn\u2019t work. How could I possibly remember every single book I passed by almost 20 years ago? As with the furniture and d\u00e9cor in Aunt Deborah\u2019s house, and the toys scattered across the floor of my old room, the books were unfathomable in identification. Could be looking at Shakespeare, Dickens, Seuss, *Junie B. Jones*\u2026\n\nI slowly turned the next corner, leading with my head as I did so. No man in sight. I kept on pushing. More books filled the shelves along the way, as well as a small apple figurine with an innocent, friendly-looking worm protruding from a tiny hole. I remembered that thing. It always stood out to me. I even asked the librarian if I could keep it, to which my mother insisted that that wasn\u2019t allowed, and that she\u2019d get me one of my own. She never did.\n\nA thump sounded from one of the other bookcases just a few rows down. I froze with dread, but hastily calmed myself as to not alarm Jennifer, taking fixed conscious breaths. My legs shakily snuck around to the path from where the thud was heard, and reaching the edge of the parallel bookcase, I leaned my back against the wooden furniture, carefully inching my head over to check. On the floor was a fallen blue paperback from the shelf, but no man. My eyes narrowed.\n\nI picked the book up off the floor and turned to face its front cover. I grew wide-eyed from perplexity at the sight of the illustration and title, instantly recognizing it. *The Napping House* by Audrey Wood. Talk about a blast from the past. I was amazed at the detail on the illustration, mostly on how my mind could remember it so well. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t the most accurate depiction, but then again-\n\nAhead through the missing space on the shelf from which the book had fallen, the man stood on the opposite end of the case, eyes and mouth still unseen. This was it. This was the exact moment I saw him years ago. It all started right here\u2026\n\nHe ran towards the left to try and make a quick getaway yet again. With all the force in my body, I shoved up against the bookcase, toppling it down onto the bastard. Countless novels, encyclopedias, essays, articles, all went crashing down in a violent mess. A chain reaction followed with the bookcases behind it, as they correspondingly toppled into one another like a domino effect.\n\nI stepped down on top of the now fallen bookcase, peeking through the several empty sockets of hollow shelves. His body should\u2019ve been there. I should be able to see through and find him lying-\n\nFrom behind, the bookcase on the other side came crashing down, and I had no time to react. It was hard to say how fast it all happened, or if it was even still happening, but as the case impacted me, I was transported through the floor, making it shatter like glass, and all around me, the library followed suit, breaking into little pieces. As the current memory broke, I was transported back into the black stage void of my subconscious, watching as the fragmented pieces of the library around me, like tiny portals into a different dimension, began their descent into oblivion. Inevitably, I\u2019d be met with the same fate.\n\nI closed my eyes, ready to accept it. This is where I\u2019d get lost in here forever, a prisoner of my own inner world. I would become a vegetable, never to utter another word or conscious thought again.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u201c*Travis!\u201d* Jennifer\u2019s voice called out.\n\nMy eyes sprung open, as an arm tightly clutched onto my own. I was hanging from an impossible height by someone\u2019s grasp, and when I looked to see who it was that saved me, I was quickly met with a sickness to my stomach.\n\nIt was him. He saved me. Why the fuck would he care?\n\nI reached over with my other arm in a swift instinct to try and grab his face, that way I could possibly feel for a mask and snatch it right off his damn head. But the man was too fast, as he swooped me over the edge of the remaining carpeted platform from the library floor, with me barely missing his face. He pulled me right from his reach, just as he did years ago in the theater. \n\n\u201c*Travis, are you there?!\u201d* she called to me again.\n\nWhen I looked up, the man was gone again. I stood alone on the wandering platform in the black abyss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I answered. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Travis, where are you? What\u2019s going on?*\u201d\n\n\u201cI almost had him. I almost fucking had him!\u201d\n\n\u201c*I need to bring you back now! You\u2019ve been in for too long.*\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? It hasn\u2019t been that long.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Yes it has. It\u2019s been 45 minutes.*\u201d\n\nChrist, it felt like only fifteen so far. There was no way. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m so close, Jennifer,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cPlease, you have to give me more time.\u201d\n\n\u201c*I told you what was gonna happen. We had a deal.\u201d*\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026 just a little more time, please.\u201d\n\nA brief moment of silence. I was waiting for it to happen any second now. In a moment, I\u2019d be pulled back into the lab room where Jennifer would remove the Caduceus from off my head. \n\n\u201c*Five more minutes,*\u201d her voice finally replied. \u201c*After that, I\u2019m pulling you out. If I keep you past any longer, you may not come back.*\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Jennifer,\u201d I said. Then I added, \u201cIt\u2019s flawed, by the way.\u201d\n\n*\u201cWhat?*\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Caduceus. The Hub. There\u2019s a huge error I\u2019d like to point out as part of your feedback. Everything I\u2019m seeing is supposed to be remnants of the past, pieces of memories I\u2019d forgotten long ago or even more recently. You said the imagination is non-existent here, and that nothing can be replicated if it can\u2019t be remembered. That\u2019s false. \n\n\u201cThings happen out of my control. People from the past act independently on their own. I realized it with Tyler the second time I saw him in the Hub. I thought it was just a memory before, us playing hide-and-go-seek. But it was only half of a memory. I called his name once I realized it was him, and he responded. He looked at me. He hid behind me in terror as we were being chased.\n\n\u201cThe man who kidnapped us. He\u2019s aware. He knows I\u2019m onto him. That\u2019s why he\u2019s running. He can\u2019t do that if he\u2019s just a memory. No\u2026 it\u2019s more than that. In here, he\u2019s something more. He still lives here in my subconscious, freely. This version of him that I\u2019ve created in my mind is real. And me\u2026 I saw myself as a younger boy. In the reflection. I spoke to him, and he responded. He told me what to do \u2013 *I* told myself how to play the game.\n\n\u201cAnd the book that I saw lying on the floor? I read that book years ago as a kid. It stuck into my brain after all this time. I never forgot it. I never forgot that cover. I remembered not only the picture on the front of the book, but the author. You said I can\u2019t fill in blanks that the brain can\u2019t truly recall, so how did that happen? I don\u2019t have photographic memory, Jennifer. I wish I did, but I don\u2019t. There\u2019s no way that picture should\u2019ve been so clear as day to me! If I can\u2019t remember the faces of those people in the frames of Aunt Deborah\u2019s old house, then I shouldn\u2019t be able to remember that book. But how?!\u201d\n\nI aimlessly searched around, finding that the black void of space was no longer completely empty. Floating almost like giant hot air balloons, portal-like fragments of the various spaces I\u2019d occupied throughout my childhood and adulthood drifted through the space, lonely sets and memories of long-forgotten seasons that I\u2019d never get back. My eyes began to water.\n\nIt\u2019d almost be nice to get lost here forever, I began to thought. I wouldn\u2019t mind it \u2013 being able to wander as I please through whatever memory I choose, forgetting and leaving all my troubles, consequences, regrets, and heartbreaks in the real world behind\u2026\n\nI\u2019d be stuck down here with him, too, I reminded myself.\n\n\u201cBut you were right about one thing,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to see something I don\u2019t want. It\u2019s my subconscious. My mind.\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes again, focusing hard enough to where I felt I could strain myself and burst a blood vessel. I opened them again, and there he was, right in front of me, back turned to where he couldn\u2019t see me. Before he could turn around in time to face me, I lunged forward, grabbing him by the neck. He struggled to fight me off, but he couldn\u2019t overpower me here. In fact, he had no power here. Not anymore.\n\nIn a brightly lit, colorful frenzy, the fragments of hundreds upon thousands of places and memories throughout my life began flashing around the both of us, like a rapid switching of TV channels down the guide. All moments from my life, in the span of seconds. And just before it all came to a crashing blinding halt, right then and there, I saw his face. The blinding luminescence overtook the area, overtook my vision, and soon after, the white light transported me back to the lab room, as the blurred view of Jennifer\u2019s face looked down at me through the headset goggles.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFor Georgia in the middle of January, the weather sure as hell didn\u2019t match. Bright and sunny skies painted the backdrop, complimenting the scenery as I drove down the decrepit pavement between the rich green meadow. Still quite chilly, as far as temperature goes, but I wouldn\u2019t have known that just by looking. \n\nTyler stayed in a small farm-type of home away from the city and constant noise pollution. Here, it was peaceful. It almost reminded of Florida a bit, which, I supposed, they weren\u2019t that far off geographically. He let me inside, offering me a coffee, to which I politely declined, taking up the offer of tea instead. I\u2019d had enough coffee from Jennifer after waking up in a panic from the Hub. \n\nIn the middle of the kitchen, I sat at the table while he leaned against the counter across sipping his coffee.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019re you holdin\u2019 up?\u201d he asked frankly.\n\nI shrugged. \u201cAll right,\u201d I answered, a lie, of course. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cDo you remember now?\u201d\n\nI returned a somber nod. \u201cEverything,\u201d I said. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too.\u201d\n\n\u201cTyler, I had no idea. I had no idea when I saw you again for the first time, the things you went through. I had no idea\u2026\u201d\n\nHe nervously tapped his mug, tightening his grip. He then took a sip of his drink, then swallowed.\n\n\u201cTherapy has been a big help,\u201d he responded. \u201cBut also, family and friends. Support. That\u2019s the biggest thing. Take all the love and support you can get. Don\u2019t push any of it away or think for a second you don\u2019t need it or can make it on your own, because you don\u2019t have to. Take it all in.\u201d\n\nI fought the tears that tried so desperately to run down my face.\n\n\u201cI went back in the Hub,\u201d I told him. \u201cI saw him again.\u201d\n\nTyler\u2019s expression instantly changed. It was hard to tell if it was one of nurtured dread or pure rage.\n\nI continued, \u201cI had to in order to catch him. We had to put him away for good. He couldn\u2019t do this to anyone else\u2019s kid.\u201d\n\nHe then spoke in a quiet but deadly tone. \u201cDid it work?\u201d he asked.\n\nI nodded. \u201cWe have his face. The police have it. It\u2019s recorded. The Caduceus allows us to record whatever we see in the Hub. I could either choose to keep it confidential or share it. I had no choice. With the technology we have these days \u2013 the forensics we have, they\u2019ll find him in no time.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, his expression changed again to a darkly satisfied, content demeanor.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, I mentioned your name as well,\u201d I added.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to give my statement.\u201d\n\nWe sat on Tyler\u2019s back porch made out of a nicely-built wooden deck, the chill yet rather soothing afternoon breeze brushing against my face. He pulled out a pack of Marlboro Reds, drawing a cigarette, then extended the pack out to me.\n\n\u201cYou smoke?\u201d he offered.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I shook my head.\n\n\u201cWant to anyway?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cSure, why not?\u201d\n\nI\u2019d done it before several times from college dorm parties, hating it each time. But with Tyler, it wasn\u2019t so bad. For once, it was actually comforting. We\u2019d talked for hours, reminiscing about the past, catching up on our current lives. I had many friends, many acquaintances through the years. But I\u2019d forgotten how great it was to have a best friend.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\u201cDo you remember that girl I had a crush on back in first grade?\u201d he mentioned.\n\n\u201cWho didn\u2019t we have a crush on back then?\u201d I teased.\n\n\u201cYeah, but this girl, the one with the pigtails and big purple bows on the ends?\u201d\n\nI had to think for a moment. \u201cFrancine?\u201d I exclaimed.\n\n\u201cYes! You remember her?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m picturing what she looks like\u2026 yeah, I do. Whatever came of her life?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo clue, haven\u2019t talked to her since.\u201d I chuckled. \u201cBut remember that time I said I was gonna ask her out and I asked you to like be my wingman and set me up with her?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk her out? To what? We were like children.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, but you couldn\u2019t tell *us* that. We thought we could do no wrong, thought we were the shit.\u201d\n\nI laughed. It was sort of the truth, more so for him than me.\n\n\u201cAnyways, remember what I gave you?\u201d Tyler continued. \u201cTo give to her for me?\u201d \n\nI tilted my head, unsure. \u201cYou gave *me* something to give to her?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, a gift. Something sweet, you know, so she could have. And then maybe she\u2019d like me. I mean, I don\u2019t think it worked, but still. Remember the flower I gave her?\u201d\n\nThen I remembered. Suddenly, I remembered that exact moment clear as day.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cYou did give her a flower.\u201d\n\nTyler laughed. \u201cGosh, I was such a romantic,\u201d he teased himself. \u201cWhat was it, a sunflower, daisy or somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\nI took a hit out of my third cigarette, then blew out into the cold air.\n\n\u201cA dandelion,\u201d I answered.","54":"So this story begins a solid 6 weeks ago. It was a brisk September evening, and I was making up my rasodook about what to do with the evening. Then I remembered, and said to myself \u201cEUREKA!! LA papel higi\u00e9nico espionaje esp\u00eda atrocidad!\u201d So basically for those who don\u2019t understand spanish, I was gonna make a toilet paper fort at Walmart. Remember those old videos where those guys would go in, steal stuff from the store, and then camp out in the mountain of shit paper all night? That\u2019s what I was gonna do. I arrived around 7:30. This is the kind of time where you\u2019d see that one friend from school, think 6th grade, with their strung out parents, and you\u2019d be all spiffy all night watching MLP AMV\u2019s over call me maybe nightcore while maladaptive daydreaming about being together (just me? Alright)\n\nSo I start assembling stuff for my temporary abode. Got a doggy bed, some pop, a nice fuzzy blanket, a small lamp, and some dip tobacco. My kinda night. I go browse through the shit paper aisle, charmin, bounce, sparkle, that kinda stuff. Sparkle by far has the biggest collection, so I decided to go there. I put my cart to the side, and started rearranging the boxes of toilet paper making it look like I genuinely wanted to see what they had to offer. I put them all to the left and right side, leaving the center open for me. I got in there, threw my stuff in and threw the cart down the aisle softly so it looked like someone left it there in the middle of the floor. I quickly shuffled the boxes so I was completely encased, and moved a lot of them to the top shelf so no one could see me from atop. I was boxed the fuck in!!! I stayed here for some time, and throughout the night, i overhead the nightly employees gossiping and govreeting about. It was pretty amusing to say the least, they were talking smack on customers, and other stores like target or FlyKidFly super center. \n\nHowever, one of them said something\u2026.disturbing, to say the least. He said \u201chaha yeah, I saw this guy earlier, he hid out in the toilet paper aisle! If I see him again, he\u2019s dead..i got the knife right here..\u201d I stood aghast at the realization that this quackling, smackling bastard just threatened me of all fucking people. I knew at this moment, it was either kill or be killed. I took out the can of Copenhagen straight, packed an absolute warthog, and waited for him to get closer. The employee he was speaking to went to the medicine aisle, so I was ready to pounce on this guy who was all alone. I sprung out of my fort like a chicken, cawing and biting and fighting about with my big horny claws, ready to send this asswad to the next world. But, as soon as I got a hold of his blue Walmart fatigues, his body disappeared and the clothes  bundled up in my furious paws like last weeks laundry. Flabbergasted, I heard a creaking sound above me. There he was, naked as a jaybird, swinging from the ceiling by his neck. Well shit! I didn\u2019t mean to kill him! I started sobbing my eyes out, a son, a father, a brother, an uncle, a grandfather, a cousin, a friend, a well respected member of the community just got sent to the grissly reaper because of my hubris, nay, my cowardice. \n\nI grabbed my belongings and ran out of the Walmart. I haven\u2019t been able to think straight since. I still can\u2019t fucking believe it\u2026a missing person report was filed for the worker and I\u2019ve kept my pie hole shut. I just don\u2019t know what to fucking do anymore and I\u2019m so scared\u2026","55":"Thurston\u2019s feelings of unease when he saw the well were a recent development. For the better part of the last 10 years he\u2019d lived on this property, he\u2019d taken Stanley - his brussels-griffon - on nightly walks through the sizable forest that bordered his home.\n\nFor the better part of the last 10 years, he\u2019d passed the well, and never once had the rotund mustached man or his rotund mustached dog sensed any sort of negative aura or fear or any solitary ounce of ugliness from the abandoned thing.\n\nThe sight typically gave Thurston a sort of comfort, if anything. The crumbling, mossy stone and weather-beaten wooden roof, even the rotted and frayed but still somehow in-tact rope and rusted bucket that once heaved up pails of water from the earth - it had all stood the test of time. It was a sort of symbol of things, Thurston had always thought. The times and the things that pass us by and go away, but men like Thurston would always appreciate and never forget.\n\nNo, the well had never set off those alarm bells in his head before. Though he didn\u2019t technically own the land it occupied, the well was his.\n\nLately, though, things had changed.\n\nWhen walking Stanley on their typical loop, Thurston found the hairs on the back of his neck prickling when they\u2019d pass the well. He still found himself stopping to observe it, but not out of any sense of nostalgia or tranquility. It was like some innate part of his reptile brain was waiting for something to happen. There was nothing outwardly different about the well. It was the same physically and visually as it had been any other night. Thurston just felt something. Something that he could put into words, but hesitated to because the thought was just so terrifying. That first night, he\u2019d pushed it to the back of his mind and walked on after scooping up the number two Stanley had taken while Thurston wrestled with his odd sense of trepidation.\n\nIt went on like that for a few nights, stopping staring and waiting, until one walk. When passing the well, Thurston swore he saw the rotting old rope sway slightly. Swore he heard the faint clinking of a rusted metal bucket against ancient underground stones. It was almost microscopic it was so faint, that swaying rope, but Thurston had seen it.\n\nAnd there was no breeze on that hot summer night.\n\nThurston had been tempted to walk over to the well then, peer into the abyssal maw down into the deep and ancient dark. He dabbed sweat from his furrowed, crimson brow. Dark stains of perspiration began seeping through on the armpits and crotch of the sweat suit he wore for activities like walking Stanley, even faster than usual, accelerated by the adrenaline and fear.\n\nThurston *knew* something was in that well. Knew it was waiting, breathing its ragged and rotted breaths, clawing feverishly at the sides of the moldy rocks and tightly packed dirt, yanking for purchase on the thin rope, desperately dragging itself up to him.\n\n*Ridiculous*, he thought to himself. *You know nothing is going to come crawling out of that damn well*.\n\n*I\u2019ll just walk over and take a look then. A quick peek. That\u2019ll sort this all out*, he assured himself.\n\nThurston stood stalk still, Stanley beginning to grow restless and irritated. He whined softly and tugged on the leash. Thurston ignored the dog. He just couldn\u2019t shake the sense that he wouldn\u2019t like what he saw if he looked into that well.\n\nHe pictured a gnarled, corpse-like creature with membranous white eyes and marble skin. It\u2019s disjointed limbs snapping and popping as it groped at its surroundings, gargantuan mouth hanging slack jawed dripping saliva from exposed jagged teeth. He pictured it darting up the walls as soon as its milky eyes locked with his, chittering and giggling maniacally as it burst forth from the well and did whatever something evil like that does when it gets its hands on someone defenseless and terrified.\n\nThurston felt another tug, and instinctively yanked Stanley back as the dog made his way toward the well, sniffing the air. Thurston had yanked him a little too hard. Stanley\u2019s marble sized eyes had watered, he had whined softly in discomfort, pain, or annoyance as they\u2019d then briskly hurried past, Thurston worrying that his tormentor would burst forth at any moment. Thurston kept his eyes on the well until they rounded a turn on the forest path, just waiting for that rope to sway again.\n\nHe\u2019d barely slept that night. The image he\u2019d conjured in his head of whatever was in that well had completely taken over Thurston\u2019s mind. He\u2019d continuously tossed and turned in his massive bed, clearly agitating Stanley who would eventually depart the King entirely to sleep on his own dog bed in the master bedroom\u2019s corner.\n\nEvery time Thurston closed his eyes, he was met with the same scene. A pale, hideous hand with dirty and cracked fingernails slamming itself over the side of the well, eventually tugging forward the monstrous creature within. It gibbered like some kind of mad ape as it scurried toward him, seeming to revel in the feeling of living earth beneath it. How long had the thing been down there? Why hadn\u2019t Thurston ever felt this before? Why did his sanctuary need to be invaded by this overwhelming feeling of wrong? He knew he would have to do something about it.\n\nHe would have to look inside.\n\nThe following evening, Thurston walked his usual path through the woods, alone. Stanley had stared at him expectantly as he made for the back door, a head-tilting look of confusion on the dog\u2019s face as Thurston didn\u2019t grab for his leash and harness but instead departed for the woods without giving Stanley another look. Like the first night, that first time he\u2019d felt that sense of unease in his reptile brain, Thurston again had a feeling that something was going to happen. Having the dog with him would only complicate things.\n\nEventually, Thurston reached that familiar mossy stone cylinder, that same rustic and dilapidated wooden roof. The well. He braced himself.\n\nAlmost as if on cue, the rope began frantically swaying back and forth. Thurston heard the very distinct sound of movement coming from inside the well. The sound of hands and feet clawing up the sides of a dirt wall. The ragged and manic breaths of something desperately ready to feel warm earth beneath its feet. It was all happening too fast for him to process.\n\nSomething was coming.\n\nA perfect snapshot of his dream, a one to one scale replica, a still life painting.\n\nThe pale, ragged arm swung itself over the side of the well.\n\nThurston\u2019s eyes bulged, sweat dripped down his wide face as the large man lunged forward as quickly as someone his size possibly could.\n\nThurston struck the little girl square between the eyes with the blackjack just as her head emerged from the well, just as she had almost finished clawing her way to freedom.\n\nHer face was gaunt, emaciated. Her cheeks sunken and dark, her eyes rimmed black. Her once golden hair was greasy and stringy and caked with filth.\n\nThe manic look of desperation and tenacity in her eyes quickly replaced by that same fear Thurston was all too familiar with once she saw him coming.\n\nThurston was so sure she had been dead when he\u2019d thrown her down the well the previous weekend. After nearly a month with Thurston in his special room, there was really no way she couldn\u2019t be dead. Clearly, though, this girl had some innate primal urge to survive. In a sense he guessed maybe they really weren\u2019t so different as he watched her eyes roll into the back of her head and her body plummet with a thud back down from whence it had come.\n\nHe thanked whatever it was men like him believed in that his reptile brain had been more acute, more clever than hers. That disruption of his tranquil ground, that creeping unease, it had all been a warning. Thank goodness he had been paying attention.\n\nThurston wondered how the girl had even made her way up to the top of the well in the first place - had she used the pathetic rope to rappel herself all the way up, eventually gaining purchase on some loose dirt or a jagged rock? Thurston didn\u2019t think that was entirely possible. He had to know. Cautiously, he made his way to the well and peered into that black expanse. Thurston never really knew just how deep the well went. The first few times he\u2019d used it, it had taken a long enough time to hear the splash or the thud. Thinking back now, though, when he\u2019d tossed the little girl in after they\u2019d had their fun, it hadn\u2019t taken her nearly as long to land.\n\nIn fact, gazing into that darkness now, Thurston swore he could almost see the glint of her glassy, wide eyes out of the shadow.\n\nIn his older age, Thurston guessed he really hadn\u2019t stopped to think about it. He\u2019d lived on this property for the better part of the last 10 years, and the well had been good to him. Almost all of his little friends were down there. It had gotten crowded.\n\nThurston thought about how it had been his own carelessness that had allowed this little girl to almost be the one that got away. And how all of his little friends must have helped her. After all, she didn\u2019t have nearly as far to climb as he thought.\n\nHe\u2019d make sure the next little boy or little girl was well and truly dead before he tossed them into the well - Thurston did not want a repeat of this mistake. And, he reasoned, he would definitely have to do something about the smell. It hadn\u2019t hit him until that moment, staring intently into what he could make out of those hopeful eyes, just how much of that stench of death and torment reached the surface.\n\nThurston\u2019s lips curled into a slight smile. He hoped that in those last days, desperately clawing at the walls of the mass tomb with her last ounces of strength, using the bodies of the ones that had come before her for support, the girl had also learned to appreciate the things that have been passed by. The things that someday everyone but Thurston would forget.","56":"[\"Some Houses\" \\[Part 1\\]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qnpuvl\/some_houses_part_1\/)\n\n[\"Some Houses\" \\[Part 2\\]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qoeypl\/some_houses_part_2\/)\n\n[\"Some Houses\" \\[Part 3\\]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qp55ce\/some_houses_part_3\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWalking back through the front door of our steadily rotting house. We were immediately reminded of the overwhelming state of disgustingness it had fallen into. As horrifying as the hospital had been. At least it was a clean horror, but being in such a sanitary area. If only for a little bit. Had forced us to embrace the condition of our house in shameful discomfort. It was far worse than we thought, and until now we were just used to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe emotionally draining spirit of the house was also waiting for us at the door. Like some demented butler who lavished in our suffering. Made worse now more than ever by our heightened sense of its condition. I was torn between wanting to crawl into bed and wanting to sprint out the door, and down the street. We stood in the trash strewn foyer trying to take in, or rather understand how bad we had let things get, but as I wracked my memory, I realized I genuinely couldn't remember doing any of this. There was a months' worth of garbage on the floor, and none of it looked even vaguely familiar. \"*This wasn't us.\"* I thought to myself. \"*How could this be our mess*? *We never leave our rooms*.\" I looked over to Anna who wore a similar expression. I wondered if she was thinking the same thing. Had we truly deteriorated into this? Or was this the result of something else? Something actively trying to break us down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe way things had been going lately the latter felt more logical to accept. It was like nothing made any sense anymore. There was only darkness, and sadness, and terror. The last three certainties in our lives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We need to clean this.\" Anna finally broke the silence. her voice was monotonous and tired sounding. She swayed back and forth very subtly as if she was constantly trying to catch her balance. *\"She's going to pass out if she tries to clean this.\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Don't worry about it. You're crashing. I'll clean this while you sleep, okay? I'll get this room at least.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I don't want to sleep.\" I understood what she was trying to say. \"*If she sleeps that horrible red eyed woman will visit her, and if she visits her, she might. . .*\" My heart sank and I struggled to hold back tears once more. \"*She might end up like Alex.*\"  The familiar guilt and ashamedness of leaving him behind at the hospital sent blasts of pain through my core. Like spears through my stomach.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"How about you sleep on the couch?\" I reassured her as I began to pick up the wildly random assortment of trash strewn across the living room floor. \"When I'm done here, I'll wake you up and we'll find a new spot in the next room. Rinse, lather, repeat. Deal?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRather it was grateful acceptance. Or simply being too overwhelmed to fight me about it. Anna slowly stumbled her way to the couch and threw herself heavily onto the cushions.\n\n\"Deal\" she mumbled exhaustedly. Before I could respond she was snoring lightly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe more I cleaned, the messier the room seemed to get. It was as if the garbage was falling from the ceiling. Waiting until my back was turned to creep down from its hiding place and replace itself. After several hours of cleaning with painfully little result I found myself looking around the house in anxious desperation. Anna remained unmoved from the position she'd fallen asleep in, and as much as I wanted to wake her up. I was grateful that at least one of us was able to get some kind of rest. Exhaustedly I stumbled across the living room to the bathroom. \"*Fuck it. I'll just take a shower really quick and get some sleep too*.\" I turned the light on in the bathroom and shut the door behind me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I turned on the shower and waited for the water to heat up, I caught a glance of myself in the mirror and jumped in startled confusion at the foreigner in my reflection. To say I looked awful would've been an understatement. I truly didn't recognize the figure standing across from me. It looked as if I had aged thirty years in a mere span of weeks. Dark circles hung off my face in bags, my cheeks were narrow and gaunt. My eyes had changed from a dark green to a cold dead grey\n\n\"*We're being torn the fuck apart*\" Anna's voice echoed through my head as I stared at myself in disbelief.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I was observing my degraded state. My thoughts were interrupted as something caught the corner of my eye. Though the shower had caused a steam to begin to fill the room I could still make out the dark silhouette of a figure peering at me from the slightly cracked open bathroom door. Dark hair and red eyes gazing at me from the darkness of the house. I jumped and wheeled around. Knocking the scattered contents of the sink onto the floor with a loud discordant clash, but as my eyes met the doorframe, I was met with nothing but an empty house. The figure was gone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was then I heard the loud scream of a man erupting from the basement.\n\nMadly I rushed out of the bathroom into the living room. The house had fallen unnaturally dark as if several hours had passed in the five minutes I had gone to the bathroom. Anna sat on the couch straight up, eyes peering wildly towards the direction of the basement door. The scream had sounded anguished and full of pain. It was like someone was being murdered down there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What the fuck was that?!\" I screamed at my roommate, unaware of how loud my voice was in my state of growing panic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I . . . I don't kno-\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore she could finish her statement, another scream came loudly from behind the wooden door. Then another, and another. Three separate voices wailing loudly with tremendous volume. Dust fell off the walls, and the foundation shook with the amplitude of the noise. I covered my ears and screamed. Trying desperately to drown the painful noise from my head, but nothing would silence it. Steadily the screams continued, and new disembodied wails began to join the chorus. Men, women, and children. All screaming for their lives behind the heavy wooden door in the depths of the house below. I tried to reach for the front door, but the darkness of the house and the heaps of trash casted disorienting shadows all across the room. Nothing looked familiar to me. We were lost in a sea of hopeless garbage, unable to find our way out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt felt as though the screams would go on forever. Steadily getting louder, and louder. Sharp pains tore through my ears and into my skull. I thought my head was going to explode. Suddenly, as abruptly as the screams had started. The house fell deadly quiet. My ears were ringing from the wails. I stumbled around in the darkness on my knees with my arm stretched forwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Anna!?\" I shouted. My voice sounded muffled and distorted as I spoke out. \"We have to get out of here! We have to get out of here! please, where are you?!\" No response. Only a ringing in my ears, and the cold silence of the pitch-black house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was then I heard a deep, otherworldly growl emanating from the abyss of the house. I instantly stopped crawling and stared blindly into the dark. My head was pounding. My arms were trembling, and I could feel my heart beating violently in my chest as if trying to escape my ribs and flee the horrors that awaited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Boom . . . . Boom . . . . . Boom.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLoud, heavy footsteps striking the wooden floors of the basement steps. Working their way with no hurry to the house above. Working their way with no hurry . . To us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Boom . . . . Boom . . . Boom.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs badly as I wanted to scream. To run. To find Anna and get the fuck out of this godforsaken house. I couldn't move. Catatonic, like a rat trying in vain to hide in plain sight from the cat that has discovered all its hiding places. There was nowhere to go now. Nothing to be done. I could only brace myself and pray that whatever was coming up those stairs would spare my life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnly moments pause before I heard the sharp and deafening crack of the basement door being thrown open almost off its hinges. It crashed against the wall sharply. Crumbling the plaster and plywood frames behind it, and that is when I saw them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dark red and glowing eyes that had plagued every waking and dreaming aspect of our lives for the last several months were Once again gazing through the darkness and straight at my direction, but they were different this time. Brighter, and somehow darker. Bigger. Angrier. Like gigantic orbs of satanic fire in the night. They pierced into the fabric of my being from the top of the ruined door frame, and emitted a horrifying red glow across the house it gazed into.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThrough the dim and malicious luminescence, I could make out the rest of the wicked entity before me as it crawled awkwardly out of the basement's threshold. The same woman we had seen so many times before. Twisted and morphed into its worst possible manifestation. She stood so tall in the house that she was forced into a grotesque hunch just below the ceiling. Her hair was wild and hung past her animalistic knees, and her mouth grinned in a horrible, insatiable hunger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSlowly and methodically loud and pounding steps began to make their way towards me. Rhythmically and almost tauntingly. Clumps of kitchen tile ripped from the floor and scattered around the room around her. Still paralyzed with fear I could only bow before her in a disheveled and terrified mess, whimpering helplessly at the abomination making its way towards me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe approached where I was crouched and bent down low to meet my gaze. The horrible eyes peering through me and into my soul. As she opened her mouth like a giant misplaced serpent. Distorted screams roared from deep within the chasm of her throat. Voices that seemed to speak all at once, and uniquely individual at the same time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\"I'll Fuckin kill you bitch!***\"\n\n***\"GET IN THE CLOSET BOY!\"***\n\n***\"Look what you made me do!\"***\n\n***\"HELP ME! PLEASE HELP ME GOD!\"***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI closed my eyes and screamed as loudly as my voice would allow. Horrified beyond belief, and threw my arms above my head like a kid in a tornado drill at school. Trying my best to weather the storm of what I thought was certain to be a horrible and painful death. . .  .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI jolted awake, and was immediately met with the resistance of an immense pain in my head. Sunlight struck my eyes causing me to recoil in agony from its blinding rays. I ached all over. From the disorienting sharp and searing waves in my head. To the dull steady aches in my back and my knees. Timidly I began to will myself to pry my eyes open against the light. Though blurry and strangely distorted. I began to make sense of my surroundings. I was on the porch of the house. The unwelcoming ugly yellow siding could be seen almost above me from the position I was laying in. The low window in front of me had been broken almost completely. A few scraps of wood from the window frame, and large shards of jutting glass were all the was left in the rectangular cut-out. As I moved, I felt sharp and slicing pain rip into my arms, and I looked at the ground around me to see a mess of broken glass around the perimeter of where I was laying. Like a torturous chalk outline. As I struggled to get on my feet the pain throughout my body erupted again, and I struggled to keep my balance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith great effort I opened the front door to the house. It seemed to weigh a ton. With each movement my vision darkened, and struggled to refocus. I had no energy. It was like I'd ran a marathon, and been forced just after to run it again. I stepped into the house. Which seemed more like ruins in the ghostly light casting its rays through the broken window. Furniture was strewn in shattered chaos across the house. Large holes punched into the walls and the ceiling. Deep scrapes across the hardwood floors with splintered kindle like substance pouring out of the deep gashes. The banister to the stair case lay caved in across the wooden steps. It was like a bomb had gone off in the living room. I had never seen anything like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Anna?\" My voice croaked out. hoarse and weak. It felt as if someone else had asked it, and the question barely seemed to break through the air of the house at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Anna!\" I tried again to shout. Louder this time, but to no avail. Like a reanimated corpse I worked my way with extreme effort through the house. Climbing over the trash piles and ruined furniture clumsily. It felt like I was climbing mountains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEmpty room after empty room on the first floor. I made my way to the staircase and sat on the bottom step, and tried to regain some strength. After several minutes, and accepting it was useless I started to shamble my way up the ruined steps to Anna's room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter what felt like hours, I finally found myself in the explosive mess of her bedroom. Her things were strewn about everywhere. Scattered across the remnants of a violent rage. Haphazardly, like a makeshift barricade against the door was her mattress. With all my effort I tried to slide the queen-sized weight away from the door. My arms shook with fatigue as I struggled against the mattressing. Finally with all my weight and the last of my efforts I managed to topple the mattress away from the door, and throw it open.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere was Anna. Curled in the corner of the empty walk-in. At the slight breaking of light her eyes winced, but remained staring beyond into the void of her mind. She had bruises on her arms. Thick and purple in the shape of handprints. Deep shivers would cause her body to tremble in periodic reminders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Are . .  Are you .. Are you?\" I stammered in shell-shocked concern. Unable to finish my statement. *\"No, she's not okay*\" my conscious chimed like a waking dream. \"*We're not okay. Nothing here is okay*.\" She broke from her tranced state enough for an empty hearted nod at my attempt of a question. A gesture that seemed to say. \"I'm as alive as I can be.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExhausted. I slumped my back against the wall of the closet, and slid down. crashing like a heap of bruises and scrapes to the floor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We're going to die.\" Anna said finally after what felt like days of empty staring\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy heart sank and my eyes began to fill with fire hot tears. They rolled down my face and stung at my cuts like acid. In my heart I knew that she was right. How could we escape this? Where could we go? It followed us to the hospital why wouldn't it follow us everywhere else?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I think . . .\" I groaned through the tears and the pain and the tiredness. \"I think we should call our people . . . Say our goodbyes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnna lowered her head into her chest and began to cry. deep sobs. I wanted to comfort her, but my body wouldn't let me. My strength had seemed to abandon me completely. Not just the physical, but my spirit as well. If there was a rock bottom on this earth. Then truly we were there in those moments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt was then. With a sudden clarity. A thought hit me. A flash back to the night of our first ritual in the basement. Sitting in the car in terror waiting for the sun to rise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"*We Never said goodbye*.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike new life breathed into my spirit I jolted upright, and began to search through the contents of Anna's room.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Anna whimpered through her tears. Aware now that I was looking for something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We Never said goodbye!\" I almost exclaimed at her. An air of unhingedness in my voice. \"We Have to say goodbye!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"It's too late now\" Anna groaned defeatedly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"No! Think about it!\" I leaned down to her eye level. \"She's been tearing us apart. Why? Why not just kill us? Why did we hear those  . . .\" I shuddered at the recollection of last night's events. \" Why did we hear those other screams? Why was she so much bigger and crazier than she was the last time we saw her?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this Anna's eyes widened. I could see the gears turning as she slowly seemed to understand what I was trying to say. She pulled herself up and stumbled back, trying to maintain her balance. As my roommate collected herself, I began once more to search through the trashed remains of her room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" She can't kill us.\" I continued through my efforts. \" She can make us die, but she can't kill us.\" Underneath a smashed dresser I saw the black strap of Anna's bookbag. My bones ached in resistance as I pulled it loose from its hiding place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But once we die . . . She eats.. She eats.\"  I didn't know how to finish it. \"*Our ghost?\"* I tried to clarify through my pounding headache. *\"Our essence? our fucking chi?*\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She eats our souls\" Anna Finished my sentence. \"She eats our souls. We've been feeding her in the basement, and if we die miserable, we'll be easy food.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI nodded solemnly in agreement as I searched the contents of the backpack. It was all still there. The Ouija boards and the candles poked out between the zippers like Excalibur in its stone. I didn't know if souls were real, but none of this could possibly be real, and here we were anyways. I put the backpack over my shoulders. Wincing in pain as I did, and grabbed Anna.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We have to say goodbye\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSitting in front of the ruined basement door instilled in me a fear I thought was impossible to feel. I could feel my knees shaking. I could feel my heart beating fiercely through my temples. Behind us was the back door. We kept it open to try and escape the house if we had to. Early afternoon sunlight trickled into the dark room. Reminding us of a different time. Far away now. Almost like a dream. In front of us were the steps into the basement. Our self-made portal to hell. I could feel her down there. Waiting under the stairs for our company. The endless hunger crawling up through the darkness like invisible smoke. It took the breath from my lungs, and air struggled to find itself in my breathing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Are you ready?\" I asked Anna shakingly as I looked towards her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer small broken body shook heavily like a leaf in a storm. Her chapped and split lips quivered, and I could see tears rolling idly down her face. \"I'm . . . I don't know if I can.\" She responded weakly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI couldn't let her do it. I don't know what came over me. What I thought I'd accomplish, but in my heart of hearts I couldn't let her go into that basement. To die down there and be eaten like some farm animal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I'm sorry, Anna\" I said lowly, almost under my breath.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore she could respond I pushed her hard out the back door. Her slender frame stumbled and spiraled attempting to catch herself through the frame. Her balance failed her, and hit the sun covered gravel of the driveway with a dull thud. Before she could collect herself. I slammed the door and locked it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIgnoring the muffled screaming and cursing on the other side of the back door. I braced myself. Took a deep breath. Lit the candle in my hand, and made my way into the abyss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I made my way down the rickety stair case, I quickly noticed the immense buzzing all around me. Swarms of black flies whisked their way around my head. I struck at my face as they tried to crawl into my ears and through my nostrils. Through the chaotic humming I could almost make out the sound of voices in the darkness. No tangible words, but indecipherable whispers through the fluttering wings. I made my way to the light chain and pulled it down towards the floor. Nothing. I don't know why I expected there to be light. I tried with no result twice more before making my way through the swarms to the finished corner of the basement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI Laid the Ouija board out in front of me, and held the planchette center to myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Goodbye\" I shouted over the buzzing flies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nScreams filled the room and seemed to cripple me. My body winced in resistance, and my hands involuntarily tried to protect my ears. Through the army of insects, I could make them out. Human shadows crawling on the walls. On the ceiling, and on the floor. Moving towards me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrying my hardest to ignore the ear-piercing shrieks I threw the planchette once more over the board and slid it to its proper location!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Goodbye!\" I screamed. Though I could no longer hear my voice. At this command the entities seemed to shriek louder. They recoiled slightly before advancing again with quickened pace. It was through the mess of flies and shadows that I saw the familiar red eyes glowing again from her home under the stairs. Her mouth grew wide in an empty smile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Goodby-\" My legs erupted into an immense pain. Ice cold, and burning hot. My vision darkened heavily, and I struggled to stay conscious. I could feel myself being dragged, and I knew where they were taking me. I was to be sacrificed. A quick meal to try and stave her endless hunger. With all my might I crawled myself back to the Ouija board. Another immense ice cold and searing pain. This time through my shoulder and the right side of my face. My vision went completely dark on my right side, and again I felt myself being pulled away from the board, and towards the mouth of the soul eating monster.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all my strength. With everything left in me. I threw my arm up, and with planchette in hand threw it hard down onto the Ouija board.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"GOODBYE!\" I screamed before the world faded into complete darkness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeptember 13th, 2014 is when we were served our eviction notice. Failure to pay rent, and squalid upkeep of the rental unit. I remembered smiling my first real smile in months as I read the official sounding document taped to the front door. The initial notice gave us three days to leave. We were out of the house by the end of that next day. We took very little with us. There wasn't much left to preserve.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd woken up in the hospital three days after saying \"goodbye\" in the basement. Anna at my side. She had told the doctors I fell into the river while taking a camping trip in the woods behind our house. They didn't ask any questions. My right eye now held the ice blue and filmy discoloration of what the doctor's thought was damage caused by debris in the river. I didn't tell them I could still see through it. I simply nodded as they told me that they thought I'd be blind on that side for the rest of my life. Though the depressing air of the house had stayed. The activity no longer came back during our last few days there. Once more it was simply as it was. A raggedy old house in a small sleepy town.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlex . . . Never really recovered. The Hospital took his leg, and the house took his mind. He spent his remaining days in a \"Special care facility.\" At least that's what his family would call it. We all knew what it really was though. I still visit his mother sometimes. She still cries for him a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt took a long time, and a lot of work, but Anna was eventually able to find happiness again. Never quite like she was before the house though. Her eyes never really stopped darting, and her carefree nature could have never really returned after what she'd been through. She married an extremely lucky man in 2019, and every time I look at our son, I see the same Life loving freedom that she used to have, and it fills me with great joy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for me . . . I don't know. I still don't sleep some nights. I still find myself freezing cold a lot, even when it's warm out, and I catch glimpses of things sometimes. Things that are there, but aren't. Though the park across the house is beautiful. My son will never go there. Though there are shops on that side of town. My son will never go there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI visited the house one more time a few weeks after moving out to return my key to the landlord. I approached his car and threw the keys into his lap. Without a word he pulled out of the driveway, and I never saw him again. Before I returned to my car to head out, I looked up at the building one more time. There in the windows were the clear shapes of human silhouettes pressed against the windows. Looking down at me on the street below, and through the open front door. In the backs of the halls towards the basement. The red eyed frame of the woman peered at me. Her empty grin smiling wide as her arm waved goodbye.","57":"the trees were still the fields silent a lonely house laid on a plot of land no one paid attention to\n\na run down shack no one paid

on the back porch, spending our evenings as we often did when I asked him about a weird story my parents had used to scare me as a kid.\n\n\"It was some kind of monster cat that would eat me if I was bad.\" I said, swirling my beer around thoughtfully as I tried to remember what it was called, \"I used to live in fear of it since Mom said it would eat me if I didn't finish my chores. It was the...the whoopin cat? The Whomping Cat\u2026.\"\n\n\"The Wampus Cat,\" my Grandpa said, draining his beer and launching it into the tree line like he often did.\n\n\"That's the one. I hadn't thought about him in years until last night. I dreamed that I was small again, wandering around your house and looking for people. I never really saw him, but out of the corner of my eye, I could see this big shadowy creature stalking me. He kind of reminded me of one of those guys in a mascot costume. I never got a good look at it, it was always hiding, but I remember being pretty scared as he followed me around the house. He made this kinda sound, like a house cat but loud and long, like a cat that's been startled or is about to fight.\"\n\nSuddenly, Grandpa loosed a cry like a scalded cat, and I heard all the animal noise around us taper off.\n\nHe looked back at me and asked, \"Did it sound like that?\"\n\nI was speechless, \"Yeah, exactly like that, but how\u2026.\"\n\n\"I taught your mother how to recognize that call. I didn't want her to go through the same horrific experience I had.\"\n\n\"Experience what exactly,\" I asked, slightly confused.\n\n\"The Wampus cat.\"\n\nI stared at him for a moment, the night birds starting to tune up again as Grandpa leaned back and stared at the night sky.\n\nWe were silent for a few minutes, the crickets loud as they put on the last concert before Autumn put them to ground, before Grandpa said, \"I saw him once.\"\n\nMy head was a little foggy, and I mumbled out, \"Saw what?\"\n\n\"The Wampus Cat. I saw him once.\"\n\nMy skepticism starred to claw its way out, but ever since the Tree incident, I had been a little more open to Grandpa's stories.\n\n\"Ya? Mind telling me about it?\"\n\nGrandpa seemed to think about it for a second before he began.\n\n*I was about five or six when cousin Luke came to stay for a week. My mother's sister was going to stay with Luke's sister to help her deliver her first baby, and she asked if Luke could stay for a while. Momma said he'd be staying in my room with me, and even though I said I didn't mind, I wasn't very excited by the prospect of Luke staying with us.*\n\n*Luke was not a good kid, you see.* \n\n*Luke was the baby in his family, two older brothers and a sister who were all out of the house, and this had led him to be a bit of a brat. He was also a bully, and I knew I would have to keep an eye on my things if I didn't want them to go missing. I would also have to make sure to spend as much time in the woods as I could when I wasn't at school. Otherwise, Luke would likely make excuses to play rough with me. I wasn't a fragile child, but Luke was a few years older than me and had often left bruises after we \"played\".* \n\n*So, Luke came over, bag packed for a week or more, and Aunt Karra thanked us for letting him stay. Despite her difficult son, Aunt Karra was an absolute delight, and I didn't hold it against her that I would have to deal with Luke for the foreseeable future. She gave me a tight hug, thanking me for taking Luke into my room and promising me something special when she came back. I thanked her, but I was thinking that the only gift I was looking forward to was the return of my room and my quiet existence.*\n\n*I showed Luke to our room, showed him the cot he would be sleeping on, and turned to find him putting his bag at the foot of my bed.*\n\n*When I asked him what he was doing, he just grinned like a fox and waggled a finger at me.*\n\n*\"Not very Christian of you to make the guest sleep on a saggy old cot. A real guest would be offered the bed while you sleep on the cot, don't you think?\"*\n\n*I wanted to argue with him, but I realized it wouldn't do any good.*\n\n*As I tried to get comfortable on the couch that night, listening to Luke snore lustily in my bed, I knew it was going to be a long few weeks.*\n\n*However, after a week of having Luke there, I was good and ready to have him gone. In that time, he had managed to sprain my wrist after pushing me out of a tree, steal my favorite rock from my collection, though he claimed it hadn't been him, and break any number of the small number of toys I owned. To my parents, he was an angel, always minding his manners around my mother and, especially, around my strict father. He always appeared to help with chores, walked with me to school, and was polite while they were around. The second their backs were turned, he cut school, shirked chores, and mocked these \"bumpkins\" to their backs.* \n\n*It was Sunday when our neighbor knocked at the door. It was working towards mid-afternoon, the sun taking on that golden tint that you see when it's getting ready to set when the knock came, hard and frantic. Daddy went to get it, and it turned out to be Mrs. Douglas, our second closest neighbor. She had run nearly six miles to our house to help get Mr. Douglas to the hospital. He had fallen off a ladder while fixing something and broken his leg pretty badly. She had managed to get him onto the porch, but she couldn't drive him there herself since they didn't own a car. This was the nineteen-thirties, so that wasn't uncommon, and my parents agreed to go help her.*\n\n*Momma told us to stay here while she went and helped Daddy, telling us to tidy up while they were gone. I asked momma if I could go with them, saying I wanted to help, but really just not wanting to be left alone with Luke. Mamma smiled and ruffled my hair, thinking I was just trying to avoid cleaning, and told me that I had to stay here and watch the house while they were gone.*\n\n*\"Besides, you don't want the Wampus Cat to hear that you're shirking your responsibilities, right?\"*\n\n*That sent a chill up my spine.* \n\n*Much like you, I was pretty scared of the Wampus Cat. Not just because my momma talked about it, but because my Grandma talked about it. Grandma used to say that the Wampus Cat came to get little kids who disobeyed their parents, dragging them off into the woods and devouring them in their lair. He roamed the woods, listened for misbehaving children, and took care of them so their parents no longer had to be burdened with them.*\n\n*\"He has coal-black fur and coal red eyes. He's tall as a man and wide as a bear. He has razor-sharp teeth that seem too big for his mouth and claws like kitchen knives. You'll know him by his cry, a sound like a cat scalded by the stove, and by the smell of fresh blood. Nothing will stop him from getting his prey, nothing, and you don't want to be the focus of his ire.\"*\n\n*When Grandma told me to beware of something, I bewared it.*\n\n*So as the old truck rumbled out the front yard, I set about the chores. There were dishes to wash, there were floors to sweep, there were counters to clean, and there was washing to bring in as well. As I started wiping the counters, I heard Luke snort, continuing to throw the baseball he had been playing with up into the air before catching it. He hadn't gotten up off the couch and was sitting with his head near the ground and his feet on the back, something Mamma had asked him not to do.*\n\n*\"You still believe in that old cat?\"*\n\n*I looked up, confused by the question.*\n\n*\"Of course. Mamma wouldn't lie about something like that. Don't you?\"*\n\n*\"No, I figured out a while ago that the Wampus Cat was made up. Have you ever seen a cat that big? It's all nonsense.\"*\n\n*I tried to rationalize this, the cleaning cloth still held in my hand. That couldn't be right. My momma had never lied to me, and my Grandma had certainly never lied to me. My momma might tease me sometimes, but she always told me it was a joke afterward. My Grandma, though, did not joke about the strange things that might be found in the Appalachians. This would muddy the waters and might cause me to question something that would get me killed.*\n\n*As Luke played with his ball, I continued to clean and finish my chores.*\n\n*As I cleaned, I began to feel something watching me. It began as a tickle on the back of my neck, that feeling that I wasn't quite alone. As I washed dishes, I could almost feel a presence looming just out of sight, its hulking form seen out of the corner of my eye. It seemed to linger near the windows, its bulk sometimes blocking out the light. I felt my eyes creeping over to have a look, but I remembered what my Grandma had said and kept my eyes forward and away from the windows.*\n\n*\"If you ever feel something watching you, it's best to just ignore it. Some critters really don't like being seen, and seeing them could be the last thing you ever see.\"*\n\n*I finished the dishes as the sun began to sink towards the edge of the horizon. I could feel those eyes behind me, could feel them boring me, and I didn't want to look at whatever possessed those eyes. It seemed intent on me, showing no attention to my cousin in the living. I had to finish cleaning. Momma would be mad if I didn't. I turned around, my legs wooden pegs beneath me, and felt my breath stick in my throat as I saw him.*\n\n*I only saw him for a second, but that was a second too long.* \n\n*He loomed in the window near the mudroom, his bulk making the setting sun appear muted. His fur was cole black, looking matted and tangled as the burdocks stood out against the glass. His eyes were living coals, seeming to simmer in his head as he stared at me. His claws tapped lightly against the window, those long yellow talons that sprouted from his furry hands. His teeth were too big for his mouth, and they poked out haphazardly from a heaving mouth that fogged the glass with every breath.*\n\n*He moved away after a few seconds, pushing his bulk out of the window sill, but it had been long enough to etch his image into my memory.*   \n\n*I felt the hardwood of the cabinet as it ground into my back. I sat down hard on my backside, my eyes glued to the window as they bulged in fear. The window was empty now, but I could still see the remains of his final gasping breath. I could still see his face if I closed my eyes, and those claws would haunt my dreams for many nights to come. I was shaking as I watched the window, seeing his shadow as it slid across the porch, his weight making the boards groan and the slat\u2026.*\n\n*\"What are you doing?\"*\n\n*I looked over, seeing Luke standing there with a questioning look spread across his face.*\n\n*I pointed shakily towards the door, my voice refusing to come out.*\n\n*\"Oh, what? Is the great Wampus Cat waiting for me?\"*\n\n*I nodded furiously, pointing at the window. Luke moved to the window, looking out on the porch and snorting at me. He said he didn't see anything out there and moved to the door to open it. I cried out, not making any intelligible sound, not wanting him to let it in. I sounded like a dog, strangling on a bit of something, unable to draw in breath. He unlocked the door and turned the handle, pulling the door as if in slow motion.*\n\n*I screamed internally as the door swung open, my throat holding it all in till I felt like I might burst.*\n\n*He stepped out onto the porch, looking around the door, before turning back to grin at me.*\n\n*\"Well, either he's great at hiding, or he ain't here. Hmmm, almost seems like he's made up. I told you there was no Wampus Cat, nothing to punish naughty kids. Your momma lied, just like mine, and there is nothing that can do anything about\u2026.\"*\n\n*The shadow fell across him. My attention had been drawn away as he spoke, but it snapped back to the large black silhouette behind him as the doorway was engulfed. Luke still stood, grinning in victory, but his smile dribbled off his face as he took notice of the shadow that fell across the floor. He turned his head, ever so slightly, but I don't think he ever even saw the Wampus Cat. The creature wrapped its thick, furry arms around him, lifting him easily into that gaping maw of razor-sharp piano keys. Luke screamed as his head slid into that toothy mouth, and he went on screaming until the Wampus Cat crunched down and ended his life. He stared at me as he stood there, Luke's body hanging in his arms before he turned and took his grizzly supper back into the sea of green.*\n\n*He left me sitting there, shaking and shivering, as I waited for my body to work again.*\n\nI sat there, speechless, as my Grandpa finished his story. The night sounds were all around us again, the birds and bugs tuning up again, as Grandpa took a sip from his nearly forgotten beer. His throat had been getting rough towards the end, and the beer seemed to wet it like a dry valley in a rainstorm. He finished the beer in one long pull and launched the bottle into the woods, where it shattered against a tree.\n\n\"So what happened when they got home? Surely they didn't believe that a big cat came and ate your cousin.\"\n\nHe stared into the dark, his face that of a child whose been scared into silence. He was quiet for so long that I thought he had fallen asleep, and I snapped my fingers in front of his face a few times to see if he was dozing. He snapped awake after a few seconds of this, blinking and looking around as the fear slid away. Even so, it was several minutes before he finally spoke.\n\n\"Well, as it usually happened, my Grandma came to save me. Not from the Wampus Cat; he only took naughty children. She came to save me from my terror. She came and found me shaking like a leaf, the door still open, and the sun sinking low in the sky. She took me to her house and wrapped me in a quilt. I sat there for hours, my mind throbbing under the weight of all that fear. It isn't every day you see the focus of your fear made flesh, and I spent a few days at my grandmother's house as my mind tried to make sense of all of it. My mother came in a panic after finding Luke and me missing, and when Grandma told her what had happened, she tried to push her way to me immediately. Grandma held her back, though, telling her to be patient with me.\"\n\n\"He's been through a lot, Possum. Give him time and let him rest. He's seen the Wampus Cat and lived to tell the tale. Not many can say that.\"\n\nI sat in that shaking stupor for quite some time before I was able to gain control of myself again. Aunt Kara came to see Grandma too, and I heard her crying. She cried, she wailed as I shivered beneath my blankets, but she never told. I never saw her again. She seemed to have lost her taste for the Appalachians. I went back home, and I learned to live with the knowledge that there were things out there that could kill me, things that played by their own rules. That was my first taste of the strangeness of my home, and I never forgot it.\"\n\nSomewhere in the wood, a cat yowled, and I shuddered to my core. I knew it was nothing but a mountain bobcat, but it was still too close to the cry my mother had always made for my taste. I got up then, taking my own bottle to the garbage as I went back inside. Grandpa asked me where I was going before I walked inside, and it took me a few seconds before I could answer him.\n\n\"I forgot to take out the garbage earlier. Don't want some damn cat thinking I'm shirking my house chores.\"\n\nMy Grandpa's laughter followed me into the house.","59":"\\[Donny's Story\\] ([https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qp7ca6\/rules\\_from\\_the\\_production\\_head\\_at\\_limbo\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qp7ca6\/rules_from_the_production_head_at_limbo\/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLimbo Productions\n\nHorror Division \/ Prop section\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther than the normal rules and regulations there are many rules you need to adhere to during the filming of the three horror movies we will be filming over the next couple of years that you will be a part of, \"Songs in the Attic\", \"Figure of the Sands\", and \"Better Students\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first movie you are to be assigned to is \"Songs in the Attic\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRules for \"Songs in the Attack\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#1.

At anytime they wish to stop you are to allow it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\#4. Always offer anyone who leaves due to rule 8 or the doll counter a clove cigarette.

Any attempts to requisition a full auto gun of any kind will not be allowed. The Beretta will not be of any help on this shoot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRandall I want to have this picture ready for next year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nProduction Head Lukas Hunter\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReport of Randall Gardner\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSaturday 11\/31\/1995\n\nJust got on sight, 3:30 meeting with the madam of the house. First doll count and last doll count of the house was the same. Once person heard singing and left the house quickly. Did not take a clove, Recommend to move to the action team. Two people caught whistling, #1 was found by me and removed quickly, #2 was not recovered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonal notes.\n\nI let everyone else know not to accept anything from Toussaint. Explained it as if she was an older lady with not much to her name, should work on most of them. That should have been a rule for everyone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat lady is as creepy as the dolls. I think you and her would get along just fine. I was able to recover (Named) Jeff, Donna on the other hand was within the lady's presence. Just to let you know if there is a squeal to this I have knowledge to share, this entity has 20 females dolls, 21 dolls now to 7 male dolls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMonday 12\/2\/1995\n\nDoll count was 28 at start and end of day. We have night shoots possible on the following dates, as of now: 1\/4\/1996, 1\/5\/1996, 1\/15\/1996 and 1\/24\/1996.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonal notes.\n\nSet up was a bit out there with the extra hands. I split them into groups of four and assigned each group a room to smooth thing out a bit. I have two of the more experienced hands with me acting as a control tower. The doll counter found Donna it seams, so I offered the clove but he didn't accept. It seems I picked the right person as the dolls where on their best behavior for the rest of the day. I think the Entity likes him, not sure that is a good thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTuesday 12\/3\/1995\n\nDoll count was 28 at start and end. Madam Toussaint was on sight today. I let David and Jessie run the groups as I stayed closer to the Madam. She left the house around 5PM and as per orders we left when she did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonal note.\n\nWe didn't lose as much as it would seem, the four groups merged into 2 and cleaned and loaded each room as they finished a shoot. Only lost about 20 props in total and a couple of harder to reach lighting. I am switching over to monthly reports. \u2588\u2584 \u258c\u2590 \u2580\u2588 was angry should could film any more. I think the actress you picked could be had to work with. I know the rumors but so far she has not been as bad as I have been told about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12\/1995\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDolls have increased by about 5 by the end of the month. We lost the doll counter, but the good thing is that the entity does not mess with Donny much as the clove's he has been taking from me. I think the entity let him name that one doll as a gift. Also, after naming, James seems to be a far better worker that he was on the last film. The big jump was from a bunch of idiot hands playing a bit of a courage game. I could have saved them but your rule's says not to remove a doll on Monday. Now 33 dolls, 22 female and 11 male dolls. I know your wandering but I am not going to try to get the male doll count higher.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1\/6\/1996\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook you are not going to get your film. I do not know what happens to the person who accepts a doll but I know I cannot remember the Actresses name because of it. There is blank spot on all the papers here that should of had the name on it. Any film we had used to record the shots she was in is either ruined or just blank fresh and ready to use. There are films I know I have watched her on that I cannot remember. What is worse is that I could hear singing outside the house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis biggest thing is that both her and the Madam's eyes inverted in color. The whites turned black and the Madam's pupil turned yellow with a small white dot in the center. I could not tell you the color of the actress as she went poof on the spot. I could swear I heard screaming as everyone was leaving but it was being drowned out by a lot of singing. Most the other people don't even see this go down and it looks as if I was the only one who heard the singing and screaming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do you even find these places? If you see me later on don't answer that, I really don't want to know. I bet you set this up.\n\n&#x200B;","60":"I\u2019m sitting in a bar right now, somewhere in the more southern portions of Missouri; Howell County, I think. I haven\u2019t bothered to ask. The police are on their way, the owner of the bar called them the moment she saw me stumble through the door, covered in... She\u2019d been standing at the bar, and rushed to grab the phone at the sight of me, a purely instinctive reaction\u2014I must\u2019ve looked pretty awful. I feel awful.\u00a0 \n\nWhile I\u2019m waiting, I\u2019ll type out what happened to me. I\u2019m exhausted, physically, psychologically, spiritually\u2014I wasn\u2019t a spiritual person, earlier today.\u00a0 \n\nI\u2019ve been told that it\u2019ll take a while for the police to get here, that they usually delay themselves when they get calls from this place. I guess, considering the locale, and the present patrons, it\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s not a friendly looking place, contrary to the hospitality I\u2019ve received from its owner. I think the bar wants to give the impression that it\u2019s a sports bar; it might even have been one, years and years ago; but now it\u2019s just a drab, faded place, with crooked signs, loosely pinned flags, and dated sports memorabilia.\u00a0 \n\nI feel fucking awful.\u00a0 \n\nThe owner insisted that I give her my jacket. I complied, and I remember it feeling like I had instead removed some weighted thing, a heavy winter\u2019s coat, or body armor. I don\u2019t know what she did with it after putting it into a trash bag, but I think, just a moment ago, I caught a whiff of something burning; some kind of fabric. I was given a few napkins to wipe my face, and I wasn\u2019t surprised to find them lightly dampened with whiskey. My shoulder hurts, but the pain is tolerable for now.\u00a0 \n\nI\u2019ve had a few drinks\u2014it's been about fifteen minutes, ten since the shock wore off\u2014and I guess I\u2019ll get started, now. I\u2019ve decided to write it out in the hopes that it\u2019ll help me forget it, later on. I know if I keep it inside, if I allow it to develop in my mind, it\u2019ll eventually drive me insane. Please excuse any lapses, wanderings, tangents, etc. It\u2019s a hard thing to keep inside, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be even harder to let out, to put into a coherent sequence. I\u2019ll do my best.\u00a0 \n\nMaybe one more drink, first.\u00a0 \n\nI was visiting my friend, Stu, at his house in Wentzville, Missouri. He lives\u2014he lived\u2014alone, although there was a girl in the picture, Sophie, or maybe Sophia. Marriage was still far-off, but they seemed in love. I\u2019d come to visit him somewhat on a whim, having discussed the idea a few times but without ever setting anything in stone. I knew he\u2019d be free, and that he\u2019d welcome my arrival. \n\nThere was no plan, really. Just wanted to hangout with my friend for a day or two. I\u2019d considered bringing my PS4, since he\u2019d sold his months ago for a PS5\u2014which he never managed to get\u2014but ultimately decided to leave it behind, since I only have a single controller and didn\u2019t want to spend sixty bucks on a second one.\u00a0 \n\nSitting in his living room, we chatted for a bit, though there wasn\u2019t much to catch up on, since we\u2019d been sharing every notable event of our lives on social media for years. After about thirty minutes of this, he asked if I wanted to go somewhere, and I said sure, and we were in his car a few seconds later. I opted to let him pick the destination, being unfamiliar with the area.\u00a0 \n\nInitially, he drove without a destination in mind, exiting his subdivision and getting onto the highway with the vague notion of going somewhere beyond his immediate area. After a while, maybe five minutes on I-70, he asked if I\u2019d like to meet some of his friends, and I said sure. I knew enough about them to know that they were generally *alright* guys, since Stu had never associated with bad people.\u00a0 \n\nA few changes of direction later, we were on the way to the house of a guy named Derek. Surprisingly\u2014since Stu hadn\u2019t mentioned the distance\u2014I found myself noting the gradual reduction of neighborhoods and businesses as we drove along. After a while, things resolved to look a bit more rural, Missouri\u2019s flavor of the boonies, I imagine, and by this point it had gotten kind of dark; enough to where the oddly placed street lights were on; the sun on its last legs.\u00a0 \n\nAfter a staggering, cramping three hours\u2014which we\u2019d spent listening to stand-up comedy\u2014we pulled off the highway, and turned onto a street, which, after about half a mile, devolved into what I\u2019d more accurately describe as a road, and then that diminished into a \u201cpath\u201d, poorly paved and weed-eaten.\u00a0 \n\nStu pulled his car into a gravelly driveway, and announced that we\u2019d arrived at Derek\u2019s house. The house was what you\u2019d expect, being out in the parts of Missouri where people spoke with a drawl that I couldn't\u2014and still can\u2019t\u2014distinguish from a stereotypically Southern one; even though it\u2019s my understanding that Missouri is a Midwestern state.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThat is to say, the house appeared to have been built more so with function in mind, than aesthetic. It was a hulking thing, with a chest-high porch around it. The porch\u2019s banister held a few items: clothes, towels, tarps, what might\u2019ve been animal hides. It was dark, and I didn\u2019t think to take note of every object and aspect of the house. The front lawn was decently trimmed, I guess.\u00a0 \n\nWe walked up the short flight of sturdy porch steps, and Stu knocked on the front door, opting to use his knuckles instead of the knocker in the shape of\u2014or what might\u2019ve actually been\u2014a deer hoof. The door opened a moment or two later, with a tall man standing in the threshold, two-liter of soda in hand, beard dripping with orange. He smiled, wiped his face on his t-shirt, and exchanged warm greetings with Stu. My friend introduced me to his, and I threw out some random, unnecessary compliment about the man\u2019s home, which he accepted without acknowledging the awkwardness of it.\u00a0 \n\nHe welcomed us in, and minutes later we were all sitting in his basement, drinking soda\u2014in my case, coffee. I listened to them retell stories they\u2019d told to each other, about themselves, only now with a bit more enthusiasm since there was another person present. The guy seemed alright, and despite the unexpected change of scenery, I felt comfortable, relaxed.\u00a0 \n\nThat didn\u2019t last long.\u00a0 \n\nDerek told us\u2014quite somberly\u2014that he had work in the morning, so he couldn\u2019t drink, which I assumed had been Stu\u2019s general plan upon arriving, if not the reason for coming altogether. Instead, we went outside and sat on Derek\u2019s back porch, I in one of the pock-marked lawn chairs he\u2019d brought out of a shed. He and Stu sat on the porch itself, beside me. I accepted the guest-of-honor position happily, since the porch seemed freely infested with a weirdly varied assortment of bugs. Neither of them seemed to mind, though, and Stu even let one curious beetle crawl from his finger to his wrist before flicking it away. \n\nThe sun had gone completely down by this point, and we were starting to feel the chill of the night when Derek told us, suddenly and almost dramatically, to be quiet. Behind the house, there\u2019s a long, sprawling lawn\u2014maybe an acre, which is huge to me\u2014with knee-high, obviously unmaintained grass. Beyond this, there\u2019s a wall of woods, the vegetation dense to the point of having its own darkness separate from the night\u2019s. Derek\u2019s eyes were directed at this area, and Stu and I, upon looking at him and seeing his severe expression, directed ours out there as well.\u00a0 \n\nI saw nothing, just that wall of wood, which, in its density, seemed more like a low-lying mountain range than a collection of trees and bushes and whatever else constitutes \u201cthe woods.\u201d But my ears, when directed to listen for something above the general ambience of the night, honed in on something strange\u2014a whisper, frantic, but not irregular. The sound was rhythmic, as if spoken to a beat. And though it was obvious that the whisper-noises were coming from the woods, I heard them quite audibly; the words themselves were indistinct, just beneath a level of comprehension, but the volume was loud, as if the source was nearby. I don\u2019t know how else to explain it, really; to stick with the senses for an analogy, it was like how they say you can see a lit match from a mile or however far away at nighttime. You obviously can\u2019t feel the heat, but you can see the little flame. I couldn\u2019t make out the words, but I could clearly hear the sound.\u00a0 \n\nAm I making any sense?\u00a0 \n\nI didn\u2019t think for a second that Derek was playing with us. He hadn\u2019t known we were coming, and had been in the basement with us the whole time, and lived alone. There\u2019d been no time or opportunity for him to plan some weird prank. And he had work in the morning. Anyway, he couldn\u2019t have possibly accomplished what happened after I consciously acknowledged the sound.\u00a0 \n\nAs if feeling the need to do something, Derek stood, and Stu and I followed suit. I thought he was going to head back inside, that he was as creeped out as I was about the weird, incomprehensible sound, but he instead strode on toward the yard; obviously meaning to investigate the noise. Stu followed, due to some friendly duty of accompaniment, or his own interest in the sound. I of course followed, not wanting to be left alone in the dark, in the ass-end of Missouri.\u00a0 \n\nI tried not to think of how only a thin layer of polyester separated my legs from the bug-ridden grass. (I am not a fan of bugs.) I do remember thinking how the air felt fresher, cleaner, and how this made the circumstances all the weirder; because I had by this point begun to unconsciously suspect the presence of something very *strange*, something deeply unnatural about the sound.\u00a0 \n\nLeaving the lawn\u2014which ended a few paces short of the tree line\u2014we stopped, brushed ourselves off (no clinging bugs, somehow) and listened. The whispering was as audible as ever, and as unintelligible as ever. There was definitely a rhythm to it, now made obvious by how, incredibly, the darkness within the woods seemed to...shift? To throb with it. If you\u2019ll allow me to be a bit \u201cpoetic\u201d, imagine the entire stretch of woods submerged underwater, and a steady current ebbing and surging through it, almost hypnotically. That\u2019s what it was like, and looking at it made me feel more than a little uneasy. I didn\u2019t want to say anything, though; for fear of coming across as jumpy to Derek. I don\u2019t know why I gave a shit about what Derek thought.\u00a0 \n\nThankfully, Stu voiced my unease, saying, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t look right.\u201d\u00a0 \n\nDerek nodded, absentmindedly, and I noticed for the first the knife he\u2019d brought, which he held in his trembling hand. I can\u2019t tell you when he drew it. Must\u2019ve been upon coming face to face with that odd, pulsing darkness, and feeling some powerful sense of vulnerability. He was obviously scared shitless, and I found myself feeling much better about my own fright.\u00a0 \n\nI don\u2019t think he *intended* to take that horribly fateful step. His foot seemed to rise and move forward of its own volition; this autonomy accentuated by the expression of surprise\u2014of fearful bewilderment\u2014on Derek\u2019s face, as the foot landed *a foot* ahead of him. That\u2019s all it took. A single step, a single gesture of approach; the suggestion of encroachment. Or of invitation from the opposite side.\u00a0 \n\nIn a mentally reeling moment, the whispers were reversed, turned into a shout, and the three of us heard, with perfect clarity, the message that had been repeating itself for minutes:\u00a0 \n\nWE JUST NEED ONE OF YOU. COME CLOSER. WE JUST NEED ONE OF YOU. COME CLOSER. WE JUST NEED ONE OF YOU. COME CLOSER. WE JUST NEED ONE OF YOU. COME CLOSER, \n\nI burst into tears almost immediately. Uncontrollable, profuse crying. The sound\u2014how could I even begin to describe it? There was a vastness\u2014that's the most fitting word I can think of\u2014about it. Not just in volume, but in quantity of voices. There seemed to be dozens if not hundreds of voices, all speaking at once, perfectly at once. There is no human choir capable of performing so simultaneously. Aside from the vastness, there was an urgency about the voices; a *need* that terrified me. The vastness, the aching, it was all so horrible. I was scared for my life, and I hadn\u2019t yet even *seen* anything.\u00a0 \n\nStu fainted; his mind utterly incapable of handing the bizarre phenomenon. Derek, receiving the brunt of the vocal assault\u2014by only a few feet, mind you\u2014started to jitter in place. I heard his teeth rattle, and a moan, low and gurgling, escaped his lips, somehow still audible against the sonic backdrop of the dreadful chant. \n\n\u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\u00a0 \n\nThat\u2019s the last word Derek ever said. I don\u2019t know if it was a general acknowledgement of the circumstances, or if he\u2019d experienced something even more heinous in his final moments, but a second later, he was *pulled* into the trees, into the darkness.\u00a0 \n\nI froze, then. Mid-sob, mid-sputter, mid-breath. My body just stopped working upon seeing Derek get *yoinked* away. A series of sounds followed, the most notable of them was a loud, prolonged, tearing sound. A scream, only loosely human, accompanied it. In my petrified state, I could only listen. The scream died out before the tearing sound. *That* continued on for a few more seconds. What knocked me out of my terrified shock were the sounds that arose not long after. Horribly, bleakly familiar sounds. That same agonized scream, only now played through dozens, hundreds of voices. It echoed and resounded, seeming to come from multiple directions and elevations. I made a single, clarifying observation:\u00a0 \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re testing it out.\u201d\u00a0 \n\nStill, I wasn\u2019t yet prepared to run. I wanted to, my nerves screamed at me to, but my legs were still *defrosting*; the control of my limbs not yet returned to my brain. I was therefore forced to *see* the first manifestation, the first emissary of the voices in the darkness.\u00a0 \n\nIt walked out from between two tightly pressed trees, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m embellishing what happened when I say that the trees leaned away from its figure. The thing was humanoid, and that\u2019s the nicest thing I can say about it. Two arms, two legs, something that would\u2019ve, in a deeper darkness, passed for a head. But in that still early night, with the moon somewhere overhead, it was obvious that what or whomever had assembled this thing hadn\u2019t thought to make its outward appearance adhere to that of a human beyond the most basic form.\u00a0 \n\nThe \u201chead\u201d was just a ball of meat, with a set of eerily shiny antlers jutting partially out of the forehead, partially from the temples. A sort of tripodal crown of bone. The face was a mask of glistening, dripping *mush.* The body was similarly grotesque, although certain parts seemed roughly *stylized* to resemble the inner musculature of a human. A tightly woven thigh muscle here, half of a row of abs, there. The handle of a knife, Derek\u2019s knife, jutted out from the chest, and I got the grisly impression of a knife embedded in a slab of meat on some butcher\u2019s counter. There was a smell, an animal odor, tinged with an weird sweetness that wasn\u2019t altogether unappealing\u2026 \n\nThe raw nudeness of its body, its anatomical incompleteness, the obvious impossibility of natural function, really touched something within me. Really loosened a screw. More tears came.\u00a0 \n\nThere were no eyes; no mouth, no nose; no ears; nothing in the way of facial features or sensory organs. Yet the thing nonetheless spoke, and this time I heard all the voices, all the obscenely inhuman speakers, focused into one loathsome voice. \n\nAnd this, their first words through a roughly human vessel, drove me to move\u2014to run:\u00a0 \n\nYOU\u2019LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND JOY IN LIFE NOW THAT YOU\u2019VE SEEN US. \n\nYOU\u2019LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND JOY IN LIFE NOW THAT YOU\u2019VE SEEN US. \n\nYOU\u2019LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND JOY IN LIFE NOW THAT YOU\u2019VE SEEN\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nME. \n\nI left Stu behind. I left him there on the grass, unconscious, five feet away from that nightmare. I turned heel and pathetically fled through Derek\u2019s lawn, crying, probably pissing myself. But the thing, that consolidation of horrors, didn\u2019t just let me run away. Had it been some weaker thing, a smaller choir, it might\u2019ve. But there\u2019d been so many whisperers; so many had repeated Derek\u2019s dying scream. The thing was an amalgamation of many\u2014a legion of horrors.\u00a0 \n\nWhen I heard the steady, distinctly *four-footed* trot of some large animal approaching quickly from behind, I put my heart and soul into my sprinting. I dipped my head, pumped my legs, and let my animal brain take over. Meanwhile, the more \u201cintellectual\u201d aspect of my humanity was relegated to assume control of a momentarily non-essential function: sight. It wasn\u2019t necessary to see where I was going, the path was a straight line back to the house. Turning my head, I glanced behind me, feeling an equally desperate need to get a look at the thing whose footfalls sounded like those of a horse, or an enormous dog.\u00a0 \n\nIt was of course neither.\u00a0 \n\nThankfully, Derek hadn\u2019t offered us anything to eat. If I\u2019d had food in my belly, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve needed to vomit at the sight of that thing, or even would\u2019ve been too full to muster up that last, life-saving *oomph* needed for my escape.\u00a0 \n\nIt was that same abominable, ungodly creature, only now running on all fours; its arms had lengthened to allow for terrifyingly efficient quadrupedal movement. The glistening crimson flesh flapped sickeningly. The head, crowned with that unwholesome set of antlers, bobbed hungrily. Had the thing been silent, I would\u2019ve been instantly captivated by the sheer *evil* of it. It was an insult to human anatomy, absolutely appalling in every normal regard, but an incredible representation of some demon\u2019s infernal image.\u00a0 \n\nBut, as if to further demoralize me, the thing had thought of something new to scream at me. The moment my eyes locked onto its \u201cface\u201d, it started up again, this time calling out:\u00a0 \n\nYOU THINK DEATH IS THE END OF PAIN? \n\nYOU THINK DEATH IS THE END OF PAIN?\u00a0 \n\nTHERE WILL BE NO END AS LONG AS WE CAN PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER. \n\nI made it to the house. Tripped on the porch. Banged my knees and shins on the wood. Turned around. Saw a single, world-blotting image: a red form, unspeakably textured. Felt a sharp pain in my shoulder. A sudden wave of wetness over my face and chest. Got up sometime later, dazed beyond sense. Finally entered the house. Found Stu\u2019s wallet, but not his keys. Walked through the house, out the front door. Walked to the path, took that to the more defined road, eventually made it to the street. Walked along that for an hour or three. Pulled a chunk of bone out of my shoulder at some point; tossed it into the field beside the road. eventually came upon the bar, where I\u2019m sitting now. Dry on the outside, wet on the inside. I can hear sirens now. The police aren\u2019t far away.\u00a0 \n\nIn a last, desperate attempt to get me\u2014or some other, equally spiteful reason\u2014the thing had *headbutted* me, gored me in the shoulder with its twisted antlers. I don\u2019t know if the impact with a more \u201csolid\u201d form caused it to explode, or if it had lost some of its integrity, having gone so far away from its place of *birth*, but the thing just kind of splattered against my body. I suppose I realized it unconsciously at the time; can\u2019t imagine any other reason for my comparatively casual, half-conscious navigation through the home.\u00a0 \n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s the story\u2014as much of it as I\u2019m able and willing to tell, at least. I don\u2019t why it happened to us, tonight. I have to assume that our combined presence somehow attracted the thing, drew it out of some woodland slumber. \n\n\u00a0I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen from here, but I can already tell that writing this out hasn\u2019t done shit. I know it\u2019ll haunt me\u2014I can almost hear its voice, whispering from the wound in my shoulder.\u00a0 \n\n*You\u2019ll find nothing but despair in the darkness of your closed eyes.*\u00a0","61":"Like every other teenager on the planet, I have made some dirt poor choices.  Choices that will remain with me forever.  Choices I am reminded of, every time I look in the damn mirror.  Hormones and bad parental guidance are two things that go together, far too often.  A teen listening to their parent?  I would never.  I thought I knew everything.  My parents had a really bad substance abuse problem.  Even though they really did try to help me toll the line, their way of doing it always came across wrong.  Would you want to listen to your parents, screaming at you, with Natty Light breath?  I think not.\n\nSo, after the third night of getting screamed at, for no reason, I had decided I'd had enough.  I was going to sneak out of my room, while they were sleeping, and I would go find myself some fun.  My fun then consisted of: booze, narcotics, anything in the realm of forgetting and feeling good.  I was going to find some trouble, and if I could get back before my parents ever realized I was gone, even better.  I started walking.  I lived in a small town in the country.  Anywhere you walk takes thirty minutes to an hour, but I didn't care, because I was free from them.  Ever notice that it always feels like us vs. them, when you're a teenager?  I made my way to a gas station, and that is where I saw him.  He was getting out of one of those box trucks, and because I was young and naive, the alarm bells didn't go off.  You know the, \"he could have dead children in the back of this truck\" alarm bells.  I was young and dumb, okay?  He was still kind of cute; even though, you could obviously tell he liked to party too much.  He was one of those, \"I don't have to try and I don't have to comb my hair\" to be cute kind of dudes.  Back then, I was a magnet for trouble.  This was obviously going to end tragically.\n\nI walk towards the door, he trailing behind me, and I walk inside.  I was thirsty, but I didn't have any money.  I'm looking at the wine coolers, thinking about how hard pocketing one of them would be, when he comes over and says, \"you actually like those things?\"  It started a conversation that would lead to him telling me his name was Danny, he had a bottle of vodka in his truck, and that he was going back to his house.  He then asked me if I wanted to join, and promised to get me back home safely before my parents would ever know.  I was game, after the word \"vodka.\"\n\nWe climbed into Danny's truck and made our way to his \"crib.\"  His truck smelled of booze and weed.  He seemed like a normal person, for the most part.  His truck was blacked out, but there wasn't anything in it that gave me a weird vibe.  We got to his house and it was a mess...I am talking trash everywhere, hasn't been cleaned in a year, and not going to be any time soon kind of mess.  It was gross, I'm not going to lie, but I was a teenager and my room was always a mess too.  So, I just went with it.  Usually, I would have started cleaning it to prove I was a \"fantastic female worth having,\" but this wasn't one of those situations.  I cleared a spot off the couch, making sure there weren't any bugs crawling anywhere, and sat down beside him.  He was packing a bowl and unloading the contents of his pockets.  Among the contents, a baggie.\n\nWe spent the evening drinking the vodka.  I was up dancing, feeling like I was on cloud 9.  I needed that good feeling.  As I kept thinking about my parents, and how much their drinking was really affecting my sanity.  I just wanted an escape.  He took the baggy and laid it on the table.  I didn't think anything of it, at all.  It was just another drug, in my mind.  How many times have you seen those baggies, as a teenager at parties?  I mean, it's kind of common.  Especially, if you hang out with a rough crowd or like to party.  He then leans over and says, \"Wanna do a line?\"  I refused his offer, because that shit could have been anything.  \"I'm good,\" I told him.  He then puts it into his pocket and doesn't bring it back out in front of me again.  I then noticed a really nice crystal laying on the table near the door.  \"Wow,\" I said.  \"This is beautiful.\"  \"That thing?\" Randy said.  \"Yeah, I have had it forever.  The first girl that broke my heart gave me that crystal.\"  Someone had broke his heart. \"Hmmm,\" I thought.  \"Maybe, that's why he's such a mess?\"\n\nFinally finishing the bottle, we were both pretty messed up.  I was really feeling the effects of the alcohol, to the point that I no longer cared about my parents, where I was, or what time it was.  We were laying on the couch, listening to music videos from YouTube on his T.V. and he started getting more handsy.  He kissed me and started to rub his fingertips down my arms.  We then started making out and I could tell he was getting aroused.  \"I'll be right back,\" he says.  He leaves the couch and makes his way to the bathroom.  \"He's getting a condom,\" I thought to myself, as I waited for him to return.\n\nI waited, for what seemed like forever.  I waited, and waited.  Waited so long that I drifted off to sleep for a while.  I awoke, after some time and wondered,\"What the hell happened to this guy?\"  He'd been in there too long.  Something was wrong.  Alarm bells started going off, in my head.  I yelled out to him, \"you okay?\"  Nothing.  \"What in the actual fuck?\"\n\nSuddenly, someone was unlocking the front door.  It freaked me out!  Who the hell was this?  The dude comes in, looks at the disheveled chick on his couch, and says, \"Hi? Who are you?\"  I told him the situation and that his roommate had disappeared into the bathroom, for what felt like hours at this point.  \"Ah... fuck,\" he says, \"not again.\"  He then makes his way to the bathroom and tries to pry open the door.  It doesn't budge, he then looks at me and says, \"Why did you let him take that shit?\"\n\n\"What shit?\" I thought to myself.  What was it anyway?  His roommate was a slightly overweight skater dude, but he seemed normal at least.  He goes to his room to find something to jimmy the lock with, and he comes back with a fearful look on his face.  \"When I open this door, I really don't know what I am going to find.  The shit he has been doing is really dangerous.  The last time he used it, it was really bad, and...I just don't know.\"  \"What the fuck does that mean?!\" I asked him.  \"Is he going to be ok?\"  He just looked at me, scared out of his mind, and shrugged.  \"Stay back, \" he said, as he opened the door.\n\nWhat we found inside that bathroom will stay with me forever.  He was lying on the bathroom floor with his shirt sleeve rolled up above his elbow.  There were massive sores all over his arms, where he had been injecting himself with whatever drug he had been using.  I moved closer to the door and noticed those sores were big balls under his skin. They were oozing.  \"Oh my fucking God,\" I thought to myself.  The floor was covered in whitish tan residue, where he must have spilled it when he collapsed.  He looked lifeless, dead even.  His roommate checked to see if he had a pulse.  \"He's still breathing,\" he said.  \"Let's put him in the shower.\"  He grabbed him under his arms.  I went and was about to grab him by the legs, when suddenly, he started flailing.  \"Leave me the fuck alone,\" he exclaimed!  He then jerked and started fighting back.  His roommate ended up getting smacked in the face, really hard.\n\n\"Dude...Danny...stop fighting...we are trying to help you,\" his roommate told him.  Danny stopped fighting at this point, but he was going in and out.  His roommate got him into the shower and he told me to just stay back.  He put Danny under the water, clothes and all. What happened next is something I will never forget as long as I live.  Danny jumped up, like he had just became Hercules in a matter of seconds, and pushed his roommate so hard, he ended up bouncing off the shower wall.  Danny then walked over to him, mouth wide, and started chewing off his roommate's face.  I swear to God, it was like a zombie film.  I stood there in shock, afraid to move, afraid to breathe, afraid to speak.  He was eating his face off!  Something had taken over his body.  He was in a state of delirium, hallucinating, or something.  Danny wasn't Danny, anymore.\n\nHis roommate was screaming pure agony.  \"Stop, Dannyyyy....please,\" he shrieked.  Then Danny started beating his head in with his fist over and over again, until there was blood streaking up the walls and all over the shower.  There was so much blood.  \"What can I do against this adrenaline induced human eating machine?\" I thought.  There's just no way I could fight him.  Then Danny started chewing his face off again, this time peeling flesh with his teeth.  \"Why am I still here?!\" I thought, shaking all over.  I started to back away.  I was going to run.\n\nDanny stopped, when he noticed me out of the corner of his eye. \"Something new to eat, maybe?\"  I'm not sure, but I knew I had to get the fuck out of there.  \"I have to get to the door,\" I thought.  I started running, and Danny was coming after me.  I got out into the living room and Danny knocked my feet out from under me.  He was going to kill me, but I was going to fight.  I kicked him as hard as I could in the face.  It didn't phase him much, but it was enough for me to start moving towards the door.  I was down on my elbows at this point, just trying my hardest to make it to that door.  That's all I kept thinking, \"Just get to the door.\"  Then Danny comes back and is on top of me, gnarling at my face.  \"Holy fuck...he is going to eat my face.\"  I knew it was coming.  He was just too strong, and too jacked up.  I knew that leaving unscathed was probably not going to happen.\n\nDanny starts hissing at me and talking to me in a deep voice, unlike anything I have ever heard before.  It was like he was possessed by a demon or something.  I'm jerking and fighting with all my strength to get away from him, but he was just too much.  He then opens his mouth wide and bites down on my cheek.  I can feel all of his teeth crunching, grinding into my flesh.  He kept tearing chunks from face, and I could feel that he was digging into my jaw tissue.  My own skin was smacking me in the chin.  The pure agony and hell that I'm in, leaves me feeling absolutely hopeless.  I am just so tired, at this point. I want to give in.  I just want it to be done.  \"Please just kill me,\" I screamed.  \"Let it be done!\"\n\nFor a second, Danny was stuck. He had gotten his teeth stuck in my skin. I was still in agony, but I was running on pure adrenaline too.  This was probably the only moment that I was going to have.  I remembered the big crystal that I had seen, when I was dancing.  The one that reminded Danny of his girlfriend.  I was close enough to that table, but I needed to knock it down. So, I started attacking Danny with one hand.  He was still trying to free himself from my flesh, so I used one hand to attack him and one hand to knock the crystal onto the floor.  It fell, with a loud thud.\n\nDanny then jerked himself, hard, and freed himself from my face.  Getting to that rock gave me the strength I needed to fight, to live.  I put my thumb and pointer finger into his throat and squeezed as hard as I could, hoping to choke the life out of him.  It must have worked, because Danny started to choke.  I then kneed him in the balls as hard as I could, until he fell.  This was the first chance I had to get the upper hand, and I wasn't going to waste it.  I grabbed the rock from the floor and got up onto my feet.\n\nDanny was now up too and we were both facing each other.  This was the first time I had got to see Danny, in a full perspective glance.  His pupils were so dilated and he was covered in so much blood.  Blood from me and from his roommate.  Danny no longer looked like a man, he looked like an animal.  No, he looked like a monster.  The thing standing in front of me wasn't the cute man that I had met in the gas station.  I don't know if that Danny was gone forever, but I wouldn't ever get the chance to find out.\n\nI was standing, ready, with the rock in hand.  Waiting for Danny to make a move, and hoping that he would make a mistake.  Danny charged toward me, and when he did I moved out of the way as quickly as I possibly could.  Danny fell beside the table.  I charged him, as fast as I could, winding my arm back as far as I could then cracking the rock into his skull.  When it met his head, I felt as if it started to cave it in.  It wasn't easy.  I had to smash the rock into his head, so many times.  After the third time, I stopped counting.  Over and over and over again I hit him, until I could no longer feel my arms.  The fear of him ever hurting me again, took over.  Before I knew it, his head was pure mush.  Remnants of Danny were all over the room.\n\nI finally came to my senses, went over to his cordless phone and dialed \"9-1-1\".  I sat on the couch, with the rock in one hand and the phone in the other.  The police came, after what felt like forever, and I told them everything that had happened.  They took me to the police station and called my parents to come get me.\n\nIt's been some time, since the night all of this happened to me.  This situation did fix a few things in my life, however.  My parents stopped drinking.  They've been sober now for several years.  I guess, getting a call like that and then seeing their daughter mutilated would cause anyone to get sober.  I am still haunted, with nightmares.  I even ask myself, sometimes, if there would have been a Danny left at the end of this, if he could have gotten the help he needed.  Mostly though, I live with so much regret. Regret that I ever left the house that night.  Regret that I ever got into a car with a stranger.  Regret that I hadn't thrown that baggy in the trash.  Regret that I didn't do more to help Danny's roommate, who I later found out had a full ride to Columbia College to become a lawyer.  And regret, because I can no longer look into the mirror at myself, without feeling like a monster.","62":"Everyone thought it was a childish phase.\n\nA harmless game, they shrugged. She\u2019s at the age where creativity kicks into overdrive, endless dreams and possibilities stretching out beyond those chubby fingers. My parents agreed with the other grownups, towering above me as I played in the sand. Everyone smiled as I chirped, gritty hands searching for seashells and answering questions to the empty air beside me. Just a little girl building castles with her imaginary friend.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after that they discovered this new acquaintance had a taste for mischief.\n\nA few months later, a panicked neighbor called my mother. She ran outside to witness me in the middle of a tea party, upon the porch roof. Seated on a little pink blanket and raising a plastic teapot, I took no mind of the screaming adults and calmly poured a cup for my stuffed animals. It wasn\u2019t until a ladder was fetched from the garage that I took notice of the hysterics.\n\nBeaming as my mother came to my rescue, I held out an empty cup once her desperation came into reach. \u201cThirsty, mama?\u201d\n\nWhat followed was beyond my comprehension. At the time, at least. I couldn\u2019t understand the fuss over something I\u2019d done on countless occasions, especially after Vern promised he\u2019d catch clumsy me should I lose my footing. That was when I received my first ultimatum. No more playing with Vern.\n\nWhat was I to do? He knew all the best tricks, how to sneak cookies from unreachable hiding spots, what to say when I was in trouble, where to hide when it was bedtime, taking me to secret places no human could ever travel.\n\nSo, I told my first lie. I looked at my father in his stern face and smiled sweetly. \u201cOkay, Papa I won\u2019t.\u201d Vern snickered, floating upside down over my father\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAtta girl,\u201d He grinned toothily, maroon eyes shining brightly.\n\nLavernael or Vern as he called himself, was no angel. I learned this when my frustrated parents enrolled me in a primary school for problem kids. Frankly, I never gave them much choice. At nine years old, I was a holy terror in the eyes of anyone that knew me. Kids daring to mock my strange habits or outlandish appearance found themselves at the mercy of an invisible assailant. Milk soured the moment they drank it, books would fly off desks, insects infested backpacks, foul stenches followed  them, and much more until the victim finally burst into tears and  apologized to me.\n\nNone of the teachers could pin anything on the quiet girl with dark hair. After all, I was always peacefully sitting at my desk, pencil busy with coursework. It wasn\u2019t hard to be a model student. Especially with Vern whispering all the answers in my ear.\n\nThough I acted sweet as can be, many of my classmates spread rumors that I was a witch. Bullies who received an especially nasty comeuppance dropped out of sight and those that remained murmured stories of being turned into newts, spiders, or worse. Hardly within Vern\u2019s power, but nobody needed to know that. Eventually, the school board had a meeting with a group of furious parents. From what he told me; many students were too scared to attend class with a freak like me.\n\n\u201cLooks like they\u2019re giving ya the boot,\u201d Vern shrugged, picking fangs with a slender claw. I frowned and looked down at the crayon drawing I was making. It was a three-headed dog, saliva dripping from a trio of hungry maws as it loomed over a crowd of prostrated figures. Vern eyed  the artwork and shook his horns. \u201cDon\u2019t show 'em that one, your old man  might bring round an exorcist or send you off to Catholic school.\u201d\n\nI tilted my head. \u201cWould that be bad?\u201d\n\nHe flapped his leathery wings and drifted closer. \u201cOh aye, you\u2019d have to wear a starchy uniform, go to church and ask forgiveness every day, or risk going to Hell.\u201d\n\nSquealing with laughter, I rolled around holding my sides. \u201cWe\u2019ve been there lots of times!\u201d He rasped a chuckle at my antics. \u201cThat we have. But there\u2019s a big difference between visiting family and moving in next door.\u201d Laying on my tummy, I propped up my head and thought for a moment as my bare feet kicked the carpet. \u201cAunt Lilith is awfully nice. What\u2019s  so bad about seeing her every day?\u201d\n\nVern was always surprised by my nonchalant attitude. \u201cOf all the people that could have gotten me,\u201d He would often say. \u201cI\u2019m eternally grateful it was you.\u201d\n\nEventually, I understood why. Trouble followed wherever I went, it seemed. We attended and were kicked out of many institutions together as my tastes grew and matured with alarming rapidity. At the tender age of twelve, I was thrashing to death metal and pronouncing myself an atheist. At thirteen I was caught under the bleachers with a half-smoked joint. At fourteen I blackmailed a teacher after she accused me of cheating on a test I definitely did not study for. Vern slipped up and forgot to change the wording of the essay he\u2019d stolen from last year\u2019s records, forcing me to take Ms. Yakovic aside and hold her secret affair  hostage.\n\n\u201cH-how?\u201d Her lips quivered, skin fading to an ashen pallor. \u201cHow did you-\u201d\n\nI pointed to my test. \u201cGive me a passing grade or you\u2019ll find out.\u201d Vern leered gruesomely at the shaken teacher, forcing me to bite my lip. The jerk almost ruined it by making me laugh.\n\nWhen I hit sixteen, I discovered that everyone was assigned a guardian angel at birth. \u201cThey don\u2019t normally appear unless it\u2019s life or death. Sometimes to help make a moral decision but usually, it\u2019s a last resort type relationship.\u201d\n\nFrom the broken dock, we watched dark waves lap over the cracked wooden remnants, splashing over lichen and barnacles. This deserted island was one of our favorite places to talk. No sirens, no angry shouts, no choking exhaust, nothing to disturb us but the mournful cries of seagulls and the hissing ocean crashing over sand.\n\nThe cold wind sent freezing hands burrowing into warm hoodie pockets. I shivered as the gust whipped past, salt stinging my eyes. Vern shifted to block the current, forked tail waving gently in the fishy breeze as he lay on an unseen couch.\n\n\u201cSo why did you reveal yourself?\u201d I asked, tucking away the long obsidian hair tumbling from my green hood. It fell out again, whipping around until I pulled out a hair tie and secured the errant locks.\n\nVern closed his eyes and yawned. \u201cWas bored, I suppose.\u201d\n\nI grabbed a piece of driftwood and chucked it at him. Moving languidly, he dodged it without looking. Huffing, I crossed my chilly arms. \u201cSeriously? You were just bored and felt like messing with a baby?\u201d\n\nHe cracked open a scaly eyelid. \u201cWhat, you wanted to hear that you were special or something?\u201d\n\nI scowled at the floating demon. \u201cNo. Well, yes but I figured there was more to it than that.\u201d\n\nVern pulled a glass of amber liquid from thin air, ice cubes tinkling against the glass. He slurped it, sighing contentedly. \u201cI tell you, the best drink you humans ever made was the Long Island.\u201d I rolled my eyes  and pulled my knees closer for warmth. \u201cEveryone gets an angel and I get a drunk imp.\u201d\n\nIt was his turn to shoot me a dirty look. \u201cLesser fiend, thank you very much. I don\u2019t go around calling you a bitch.\u201d He cocked a bristly eyebrow and took another healthy swig.\n\n\u201cWhy am I the only one with a demon, then? Was it some clerical error? Did Heaven call a temp agency?\u201d It seemed like my questions were falling on deaf ears.\n\nVern belched a blue fireball. \u201cAlways tastes like sulfur,\u201d He grimaced, wiping his lips. Seeing my irritated expression, the dark guardian sighed wearily and sat up. \u201cI got no clue what went on during the creation of your soul. All I know is that ol\u2019 Bubs himself sent the order down the chain and I drew the short straw. Not that I\u2019m complaining. You make far better company than all the other mortals  combined.\u201d\n\nI knew there was more to it than he let on, but there were probably reasons for keeping cards close to his chest. Perhaps there were rules against letting people see past the curtain and glimpse the strange machinations of Heaven and Hell. Or maybe he just got lucky and didn\u2019t want to cause any undue attention.\n\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d I sniffed. \u201cLet\u2019s go back before my butt freezes to the ground.\u201d\n\nOur camaraderie wasn\u2019t always rock-solid. Like all relationships, we weathered many storms, but our friendly vessel was never dashed against the shore, suffering irreparable damage. Fights never lasted more than a day or two. Once tempers cooled, we sought each other out and resolved to overcome the obstacle together.\n\nAfter a particularly heated argument, I went to the mall for a much-needed breather, hoping to find some welcome distraction in the form of soft pretzels, iced coffee, and chic accessories. It was time for a new handbag, anyway.\n\nI should have known Vern was up to his tricks when mall security blocked the exit. But I\u2019d done nothing wrong. Not *that* day at least. Presenting the receipt and my new clutch, I felt a sinking sensation as they unzipped the grab bag to find it stuffed with jewelry from the store next door. \u201cCheck the cameras,\u201d I remember repeating to the police. \u201cI never set foot in Zales, the footage will  back me up.\u201d\n\nAfter hours of questioning, they were forced to let me free. Insufficient evidence and reasonable doubt. But I was no longer welcomed at the shopping center, banned from one of my few safe-havens. The loss hurt me more than the embarrassment. Some girls might have cried over this whole ordeal, others might even have called up their friends to vent. I had a different result in mind.\n\nBefore I stopped home, I went to chat with a lovely old Pastor who baptized me back when I was too young to give people gray hairs. After that productive discussion, I left with a bundle of blessed incense. Then I proceeded to fumigate the ever-loving shit out of my room.\n\nVern appeared to me, crimson eyes watering, choking, and wheezing as he begged me to stop. \u201cPlease, I\u2019ve got the most infernal migraine. I won\u2019t incriminate you ever again, I swear on the seven seals of Abbadon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou better not,\u201d I growled. \u201cNext time, I\u2019m filling a super-soaker with holy water.\u201d\n\nThese misadventures resulted in a permanent truce, vowing never to harm hide nor hair. Well, at least in action. We constantly threw around barbs and insults but never mean-spiritedly. At the end of the day, all  we had was each other.\n\nBut nothing good ever lasts.\n\nNormally, I loathed the first day of school. Not only did it mark the end of carefree summer days, but it was stuffed with awkward get-to-know-you activities. Who cares about these brainless mouth-breathers? Half of them were drop-out material, the others were insufferably smug with the grandiose career plans their parents mapped out.\n\nSo when my homeroom teacher paired me with a quiet partner, I gave him the standard greeting. \u201cHi, I'm Bell. My hobbies are not giving a fuck and looking forward to leaving this dump. The less I know about you, the more I can tolerate you. Let\u2019s work together and have a great year, okay?\u201d\n\nI studied his hazel eyes defiantly, daring him to challenge my prickly introduction. Guys either rose to the occasion or shied away from me. This one was oddly indifferent.\n\nHe solemnly nodded as the ghost of a smile hovered around his lips. \u201cIn that case, you can just call me \u2018new kid\u2019. In fact\u2026\u201d Snatching an activity sheet, my partner slid it over. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fill this in for  me? I\u2019ll write in yours and that\u2019ll throw everyone way off.\u201d\n\nI frowned slightly, questioning his motives. This guy was far too easygoing, probably just playing it cool so I\u2019d warm up. *Let\u2019s see how he reacts to this.*\n\nTaking his sheet, I scanned the header with mild interest. His parents called him August? Good gods, definitely a pretentious one. The dude probably even jokes he was named after the hottest month for a reason.\n\nAs he began to write in answers for my hobbies and interests, I covertly glanced over at Mr. August. Handsome wasn\u2019t the adjective I\u2019d use. Messy brown hair, some freckles, and a lazy smile were the only things that set him apart from being plain-looking. Poor thing. A person doomed to become an insurance adjuster or some other equally boring  profession.\n\nI looked back at the paper and grinned evilly. He was going to regret being all buddy-buddy after I was done.\n\nOnce the sheets were turned in, Mr. Clemens began to read them out. I concealed my eager expression behind a curtain of obsidian hair, knowing  he would recognize me as the culprit.\n\n\u201c\u2026 and here we have a fresh face, August. I\u2019m sure this will help all of you learn more about your new classmate.\u201d\n\n\u201cAugust enjoys\u2026 wearing a furry suit and covering himself in thousand island dressing?\u201d Laughter erupted as kids slapped their desks and jeered. Mr. Clemens loosened his collar and swallowed nervously. \u201c\u2026 ah I don\u2019t get it but I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t serious. He also wants to be a male stripper or gigolo\u2026\u201d\n\nI dropped the veil and turned to see his reaction. Was it horrified? Embarrassed? Furious?\n\nAugust was sputtering with mirth, looking as if he was about to pee himself. Crumpling up the paper, the homeroom teacher eyed the boy sternly. \u201cSeems we have an applicant for class clown.\u201d I fumed in silence as Mr. Clemens tossed my hard work into the waste bin. He didn\u2019t even get to the best part\n\nClearing his throat, the teacher continued wearily. \u201cBell likes to read Scripture each night and give thanks for the gift of each new day. She hopes to one day enter into a convent and live out the years in blissful  solitude.\u201d He shot me a disappointed glare. \u201cPlease take this activity seriously. It\u2019s not going to be fun and games when grades appear.\u201d\n\nI opened my mouth like a shocked fish, unable to think of a response. August was staring at me with a shit-eating grin that'd make Vern blush.\n\nAfter that day, the new kid was permanently on my radar.\n\nHis humor wasn\u2019t as crass or abrasive as mine, but August was fluent in sarcasm. I could always count on a cynical one-liner to brighten up my dreary mornings before we went our separate ways. Often, I found myself wishing for his presence in my other classes, yearning to suffer the  tedium with a kindred spirit. Vern rarely hung around unless I had some wicked schemes in mind. I never held it against him. I wouldn\u2019t want to  be stuck in Trigonometry either.\n\nIt was irritating how frequently my thoughts turned to that scruffy-haired kid. He didn\u2019t have sculpted features, bulging muscles, or suave charisma, nothing that made the ladies\u2019 knees go weak. I didn\u2019t fully understand it myself.\n\nHe possessed a quiet confidence, rejecting many of the popular cliques that teenagers form. I asked why he didn\u2019t try to fit in anywhere. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be what anybody wants you to be.\u201d August shrugged. \u201cWhat\u2019s  the point of trying to impress others with something you\u2019re not?\u201d\n\nI scratched my head. \u201cWere you held back a few years or something?\u201d\n\nHe peered over his shoulders to make sure nobody could hear. Then August leaned forward like a shifty conspirator. \u201cYou can tell? I\u2019ll be thirty next week. The doctors said the operation was a success.\u201d Rolling my  eyes, I swatted him with an eraser. \u201cHar har. You just seem, I dunno. Kinda mature for these primates.\u201d\n\nAugust put a hand to his chest with a terrible flourish. \u201cAh yes, too mature and sophisticated to associate with a lowly peon like you.\u201d\n\nHe winced as I punched him in the shoulder. \u201cPeon or not, I\u2019ll still kick your ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare threaten me with a good time,\u201d August quipped as the dismissal bell drowned out my laughter.\n\nWhat I liked most about him is\u2026 hard to say. It didn\u2019t matter if I was telling a story, complaining about homework, or making small talk. August had this way of looking at me like I was the most important  person in the world. I mean, he wasn\u2019t just listening or hanging on to  each word. His hazel eyes cut through the smokescreen and saw me for who  I was. Often, I had to look away before my face betrayed me and turned  scarlet.\n\nAugust was a strange word to me now. Every time I saw it, I was reminded of the sardonic boy with eyes like a shimmering pond, swirls of greenish-brown flecked with gold. My chest ached. I knew the symptoms and dreaded the prognosis. Time to consult a close fiend.\n\nWhen he caught wind of my new crush, Vern cackled until he could scarcely fly straight. The joke was lost on me. Pressing my lips together, I glared at the horned idiot until the moment faded and he began wiping away brimstone tears. But one look at my face set him off into a fresh bout of giggles.\n\n\u201c*Him?* You\u2026 you can\u2019t be serious,\u201d Vern grasped his aching sides, laying spread eagle on the ceiling tiles. He looked like a drunken bat. Wings flapped helplessly as he struggled to sit upright.\n\nI turned on my heel and left him to sober up, blood rushing to my indignant cheeks. Damn imp had some nerve. It was the first time he\u2019d straight up laughed in my face. My mind roiled, seething with things I wanted to call him, conjuring up petty acts of revenge for being the  butt of a joke. I never considered that Vern might have had his reasons.\n\nMaybe he had some part in it, or it was just dumb luck. August and I signed up for the track team, ready to try out for the various events. Unfortunately, they split us up to do laps. I was running with the girls and slyly sneaking looks at him whenever I could. His body was lean but fit. Clearly, he was in his element running - even the coaches seemed to think so. A budding star of track and field.\n\nI was certainly very appreciative of the shorts he was wearing. Never thought I\u2019d be into calves, but this year was full of surprises.\n\nWhen the coach whistled for a water break, I sidled up to August as nonchalantly as I could. Several flirty questions were on the verge of spilling out, ready to test the limits of our platonic relationship. But a brown square caught my eye, distracting me. It stuck out from behind his shirt collar, seemingly a clothing tag. A weird design was sewn on it.\n\nAugust saw me looking and cocked an eyebrow. \u201cEverything cool? There isn\u2019t a wasp on my back is there?\u201d\n\nI started guiltily as if caught spying on something forbidden. \u201cEr, your shirt. I think the tag is caught.\u201d\n\nHe reached behind and tugged on the tag. To my astonishment, it was some bizarre fabric necklace, with a square hanging on both sides. \u201cAlways does that when I run,\u201d August sighed and tucked it back down.\n\n\u201cWhat is that? Didn\u2019t think you were the type to wear accessories.\u201d I took a swig of icy water, feeling sweat trickling down my back.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d August sighed. \u201cAnd not very interesting.\u201d\n\nI tilted my head. \u201cAu contraire, I think you are very interesting.\u201d\n\nVern would probably be puking his guts out if he saw me. He hated anything cutesy or sappy. I did too\u2026 usually.\n\nThe whistle shrieked, signaling the next event. August smiled apologetically. \u201cAnother time. Good luck with the hurdles.\u201d I gave him a mock salute as he jogged off over to the relay team. But something in me felt nervous. He was hiding something. The look of relief when he heard the whistle was the forefront of his first lie. This wouldn't come up again unless I prompted it. And sure enough\u2026\n\nThat time never came.\n\nAfter a few weeks, the questions burned in my mind, rattling around a weary skull as I tried to muffle them with my pillow. I wanted to respect his privacy. August had a right to secrets, especially since I was practically bursting with them. But I couldn\u2019t shake a memory from  my mind. The little girl, forced into a lie. Except now I knew what it felt like to wear my father\u2019s shoes.\n\n*Okay Papa, I won\u2019t.*\n\nThe fragile egg of my willpower cracked.\n\n*Another time.*\n\nCracked until the shell shattered and betrayal oozed out, staining my hands with guilt. Vern knew what I was going to ask.\n\nHe could see the defeat in my eyes, answering it with a knowing leer. The air wavered and twisted as demonic energy crackled. Sparks snapped, dirty smoke billowed out from beneath his talons, smothering his hunched form. Flames burned below the curved horns, Vern\u2019s eyes scorching through the haze as his voice fell to an unholy octave. \u201cBy my arcane powers, who dares ask for the blessings of Astaroth, lord of hidden knowledge?\u201d\n\nMy voice was low and reluctant.\n\n\u201cJezebel Lorelie.\u201d\n\nVern bowed his head, fiery eyes licking at his horned brow. Then he melted into the soot. I waved a hand at all the smoke and scrunched up my nose. Blasted imp didn\u2019t have to be so formal. He just loved the theatrics.\n\nSeveral long minutes passed until he imploded back into existence. Wisps of brimstone snaked into the air and dissipated. His winged form lurked in the gloom beside my window. I was about to scold him for skulking moodily until he emerged wearing a grim expression. \u201cKid, you really  don\u2019t want any part of this.\u201d\n\nI was ready to tell him EXACTLY what parts I wanted until he continued. \u201cAugust ain\u2019t his full name. It\u2019s Augustine, after the saint. And his necklace is a scapular, which Catholics wear in case of sudden death so their souls get the fast pass to heaven.\u201d I opened my mouth, but he held  up a claw.\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t done yet. You wanna be friends, yeah okay. But if your goal is to get cozy, you\u2019re bettin\u2019 on the wrong horse. The infernal house was like a monastery. Statues and candles out the ass.\u201d\n\nI refused to accept this. It was unimaginable to think the dry and cynical boy I knew was a Bible thumper. August acted so\u2026 so normal. But the signs were there. He never swore, never wore a shirt without a collar, didn\u2019t watch a lot of TV... I ignored those nagging thoughts. Vern was just trying to scare me off, that was it.\n\nBiting my lip, I voiced what little defense I could muster. \u201cHe\u2019s not like that at all though. It might just be his parents! You don\u2019t know if he believes.\u201d\n\nThe dark guardian spread his arms and shrugged. \u201cWho knows? Maybe you could corrupt the poor thing, talk sense into him, sneak him some drugs, make him see the darkness, I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just letting you down easy before you risk going all in.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I- \u201c\n\nVern interrupted me with a flap of his wings. \u201cIf you are serious about this kid, you\u2019d best be careful. Half of the stuff we get up to would even spook a hardened agnostic. Hells bells, if he catches wind of your full name\u2026\u201d\n\nThere was a strange glint in his wicked eyes. It seemed almost\u2026 regretful. Then ragged wings flapped again and he soared through the open window, out into the night. I watched the demon fade into the starry sky as my fragile hope dwindled into despair.\n\nSometimes I hated how damn reasonable that fiend was.\n\nI\u2019m sure he was equally displeased. Vern knew full well he\u2019d raised me to rebel against the world and that I wasn\u2019t going to stop anytime soon. He was right.\n\nAlthough I\u2019d never been afraid of confrontation, my tongue swelled up and my heart raced when I thought about approaching August. I\u2019d never been a coward in my life. So why was I creeping around the hallways in fear? He knew something was going on when I avoided him, ducking his questioning gaze and scurrying to the safety of the ladies\u2019 room.\n\nI faced myself in the mirror, dark circles shadowing my panicked eyes. \u201cVern,\u201d I whispered, eyes shut.  \u201cPlease take me home\u2026 I \u2013 I can\u2019t do this today.\u201d\n\n*Coward.* I took the easy way out yet again and had Vern put a note in August\u2019s locker. *Double coward.*\n\nAfter I spent a few days at home, August texted to make sure I was doing okay. My hands shook, not wanting to press send. *Now or never.*\n\n**Meet me in the park tomorrow?**\n\nMy phone buzzed. I peeked at the screen through my fingers.\n\n**Sure :)**\n\nThen a dreaded realization crept over me. What was I going to say? That I spied and found out he was an altar boy? That I had a personal demon attached to me? That I kinda sorta maybe might like him slash want to be with him?\n\nVern said it was probably better to go with the last one and leave it at that. I think he was trying to cheer me up, stoke some hope that this wild swing would connect, and give me a home run. My confession was the slimmest of chances. And yet, I grasped for that slender thread as my world crumbled away.\n\nAugust was early. I spotted him half a block away, sitting on the park bench as I rounded the corner. A beaming smile spread across my relieved face, cares spilling away as feet quickened. Everything was going to be fine. He\u2019d understand.\n\nMy shoes stopped. Eyes widened. Lips clamped shut, quivering with anger. August wasn\u2019t alone.\n\nSome blonde *skank* was laying against him, golden hair spilling over his shoulder. She looked adoringly up at him and said something I couldn\u2019t hear. Whatever it was, he found it funny. My ears were ringing. A faceless shadow bumped into me, mumbling an apology in passing. I didn\u2019t hear it. Didn\u2019t feel it. Only the daggers of betrayal, relentlessly stabbing at my heart.\n\nTears rose.\n\nA raging ocean, crashing and pouring endlessly out from my invisible wounds. I didn\u2019t fight it. All I wanted was my feet to carry me anywhere but here. As I turned to leave, the bimbo\u2019s sight flicked over to me. She flashed a friendly smile, but the cold emptiness in her eyes revealed true intentions. *Take him if you dare*. It was the humorless grin of a wolf, baring teeth meant only for one purpose.\n\nShe whispered something and spat. *\u1e2aar\u012bmtu.* It echoed in my mind. I had no clue what language it was, but you know an insult when you hear it.\n\nBlood bubbled and boiled over. Narrowing my eyes, I tensed my shoulders and clenched my fists. Time to put this uppity bitch in her place. I took a step forward. Her sneer widened. Then a clawed hand shot out and yanked me back into the alleyway.\n\n\u201cAre you insane? That\u2019s an angel you\u2019re picking a fight with.\u201d Vern shook his head in disappointment. \u201cThought you\u2019d have a little more brain than that.\u201d He pushed me out of sight and flew over to sneak a peek down the street.\n\nI stormed back towards the park, forcing him to move me further down. \u201cCalm down, kid. We need to-\u201c\n\nTwisting out of his grasp, I raced back. He caught me a few feet later, squirming and kicking in his grasp. \u201cShe\u2019s rubbing herself ALL over him and gloating! LET. ME. GO.\u201d\n\nHis wings flapped, wind howled, and energy crackled. We were back at the docks. But the sea-breeze was colder now than ever. I shouted over the frozen wails, furiously demanding this cursed demon to bring me back to August.\n\nBut no matter how nasty I got; his infernal side refused to emerge. Instead, he grew more dejected and gloomier. \u201cI can\u2019t take you back. I just can\u2019t.\u201d I switched tactics, bombarding him with questions about the winged floozy laying claim to August.\n\nVern deflated with a sigh. \u201cAngels are always attracted to the pure of heart.\u201d *Pure of heart. Angels.*  The idea twisted and grew, an observation fed by years of suspicion and unanswered riddles. An unspoken dread reared up, the ugly truth dwarfing me in its seven-headed shadow. Why didn't I see it before? There was an explanation for why an angel stood between me and August, a reason for her attempting to get me angry enough to do something...  stupid. A justification why I was the *only one* with a demon.\n\n\u201cVern?\u201d I said slowly.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t meet my gaze. I stood right in front of him, forcing the demon to acknowledge my presence. \u201cI just have one last question.\u201d Smoke poured from his ears, a nervous tic. His wings shivered. Fear didn\u2019t look good on him.\n\nPulling on his curved horns, I made the shifty creature look me in eye. \u201cWhat does *\u1e2bar\u012bmtu* mean?\u201d\n\nLicking his lips, Vern took a shaky breath. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s ancient Babylonian.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd\u2026 it means whore.\u201d\n\nI staggered back and slumped against the cracked concrete. All it took was a word. A brief sound, a simple expression. And with that collection of hurtful syllables, my entire existence suddenly fell into place.\n\nJezebel the whore.\n\nMother of harlots and abominations of the earth.\n\n[Part Two: Lamentations](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qrsncr\/growing_up_i_always_had_an_imaginary_friend_part\/)","63":"*This is the story of an American who wrote these lines shortly before his death. He gave them to his daughter and she posted them on some occult websites. That is where I found them. The happenings of this report probably took place in the year 1976.*\n\nI drove my truck for more than forty years through the Rocky Mountains, delivering goods, making my money. Never had there been any troubles on my journeys \u2013 other than one or two breakdowns. But the story that I want to get off my chest at this moment, at the eve of my life, happened exactly as I am about to write it down, about thirty years ago \u2013 I swear. When my mind will soon find its final peace, I will at least not be able to hear the laughter of the people who read this.\n\nIt is probably best to start from the very beginning. My life as a trucker might have been a lonely one from time to time, but I could always count on my colleagues. In silent moments their voices gave me company in my isolated driver cab over the radio.\n\nNever would I have even remotely been able to dream up the unsettling situation I would experience. It was the summer of 1976, the month, however, I am not sure about anymore. Maybe June?\n\nThe journey had lead me and my loyal truck over Olive Ridge, at the rims of the National Park, and I gazed upon a crystal clear lake that sparkled down below the road, at the foot of a grassy hill.\n\nI still remember the cloudless sapphire sky, filling me with a feeling of comfort and carefreeness. The rhythmic sound of my truck's engine that had been my sole constant companion for the past years felt soothing, almost hypnotic. The leather seat that had over time adapted itself to the shape of my back gave me comfort and peace.\n\nPerhaps it gave too much peace, for I noticed the man jumping onto the road in front of me almost too late. My reflexes allowed me to hit the brakes just in time, stopping the truck so that the old vehicle came to a screeching halt only a few steps away from the madman.\n\nI must have gotten out of the driver cab and started marching towards him, because nowadays I only remember standing right in front of the man, ready to rip him a new one.\n\nWhen I stood there, I suddenly noticed something metallic.\n\nThat lunatic had a gun!\n\nAngrily I stopped all movements and took a closer look at the man.\n\nThe guy had to be in his late thirties, had blond, disheveled hair, a crazy look in his eyes and torn clothes.\n\n\"You, over there! Stay still, exactly where you are!\" he demanded with a croaky voice.\n\nI made my piece with God, assuming the lunatic would shoot me, just to get a hold of my truck. Silently, I cursed myself for my stupidity. Why hadn't I stayed inside the cab, where it would have been a little safer? After all, everybody knew that people at the roadside never meant good news.\n\n\"Calm down, dude!\" I must have tried to talk to the madman.\n\n\"You... you are not... him... I thought...\" the guy stuttered, perplexed.\n\n\u201eWhat is your name? What do you want from me? If you wanna kill me, just do it already!\" I tried to distract him.\n\n\"My name? I... My name is Stanley. Or Stan. I had a breakdown, must have gone too fast. Too hectic...\" he introduced himself, pointing behind his back with his free hand.\n\nOnly now, I noticed the old jeep, having been run against one of the many trees at the hillside, apparently by a confused Stan. That calmed me down a bit. Perhaps he was content with hitching a ride.\n\n\"Where to?\" I therefore asked.\n\n\"Just onward. Just... onward...\" Stanley whispered and looked up and down the road, apparently searching for someone.\n\nSuddenly, he took down his weapon and started crying, shaking.\n\n\"I am sorry, I am so sorry! I am just not myself anymore! Please, take me with you, please, I beg of you! I will give you all my money, everything I have, everything you want! Please! I beg of you! If I were to stay...\"\n\nConfused, I took a closer look at the poor sod and started thinking about knocking him out cold. However, the strange, deep fear in Stanley's eyes made me hesitate. Additionally, some extra money was always a nice thing, especially in my line of work.\n\n\"Are you on the run from the cops?\" I wanted to know skeptically. Helping a wanted man was not my cup of tea, after all.\n\nStanley only let out a sad snort.\n\n\"The police? No, I would have been happy to meet a sheriff or a deputy around here! Perhaps they could have helped me! No, don't worry\u2026 But I need to leave, now!\" he shouted agitatedly whilst flailing around the gun.\n\n\"Alright, alright! Get in, get in!\" I hastily said.\n\nIt would be easier to knock him out as an emergency measure when he was sitting right next to me.\n\nThat is why I let him climb onto the passenger seat. With a grumpy mumble, I took my place behind the wheel again.\n\n\"P-p-please, I am sorry, b-but my life is at stake here...\" Stanley stuttered apologetically after some minutes of unpleasant silence.\n\n\"Hm,\" I said.\n\n\"What is your name?\", he wanted to know, probably to calm the situation down a bit.\n\n\"Bert,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, Bert, I am so sorry for my behavior. But I am just terrified. He might... get me\", Stanley explained and looked down at the ground, terrified.\n\n\"He, he, he! He? Don't be so vague!\" I barked at him.\n\n\"You... would never believe me,\" Stanly said.\n\n\"I have heard my share of crazy stuff. One of my colleagues tells me of his bigfoot-sightings at least once a week. Your story can't be more unbearable,\" I informed him, nodding my head towards the radio.\n\n\"My tale is so crazy, even I wouldn't believe it. Had I not just lived through it...\" Stanly admitted with a gulp.\n\n\"Then hurry up! Tell me!\" I said, silently getting a bit excited.\n\nI had always liked a good story and that way this poor guy wouldn't accidentally shoot me in the head.\n\n\"So be it...\n\nIt all started three days ago. Everything. Three days ago, when my life was still normal and boring. I never would have guessed saying this one day, but... I miss my bleak job as a desk worker, my little box...\n\nWell, it was around midday and I took a walk during my break time as I did every day. You know, I have met many people that think of Salt Lake City's skyline as something that closes you in, but for me it has always been home, a place of safety. I have lived my whole live there, never having known anything else.\"\n\n\"Poor guy,\" I remarked.\n\nHow could one ignore the call of this huge world? The call to adventure?\n\n\"I know myself, that I am just a simple man from the city, one amongst a million others, but my life was great... until that moment. I walked unhurriedly through downtown, enjoying my break. It had been a hard day, many things to calculate, many things to organize. I strolled through the streets, seeing all the other people minding their own business, passing by each other.\n\nThen it happened. A car crash, right next to me on the main street.\n\nAn old van hit a school bus\u2026 Did the driver perhaps have a stroke? Anyway, you might understand the shock I was in! The bang, the smoke. And I don't know why, but moments later the bus was ablaze. Horrible, all those people, all those children, just...\"\n\nStanley stopped and looked into the void, trembling.\n\n\"Everyone would be shocked. That still does not explain your behavior,\" I remarked, but I couldn't wait for him to go on.\n\n\"No, no, of course not! If it had only been that! A shock would have been easier to cope with! Everything burning, ablaze! The children, the people around, confused, horrified. Madness and misery, horror and anguish\u2026\n\nAnd then...\n\nI spotted him.\n\nHe was standing on the other side of the street and observed the gruesome happenings, completely unmoved by the screams and the smell of burning flesh and melting metal.\n\nThis... man...\n\nHe stood there, just stood there, expressionless, letting his gaze trail over the parts of the bus that were disappearing in flames.\n\nHis dark grey pinstripe suit did not have a single mote of ash on it and his shoes shimmered dark in the light of the midday sun, sinister and alien. His skin was pale and strangely coarse, his white hand gripping an old suitcase. That thing looked hideously out of place and out of time... a bit like him.\n\nWhy was he just standing there? Was he admiring the chaos? Was he in shock as well? It felt more and more strange, him just standing there\u2026\n\nI firstly could not get a look at his face due to the smoke and\u2026 today I wished it had stayed that way.\n\nI... I can't describe this grimace! I just can't, my throat won't let the words out\u2026\n\nAnd when I looked at that man, I suddenly felt his icy gaze resting on me, from those... eyes. I don't know why I fled, but I only came to my senses back at my office, back in my box.\"\n\n\"That's all? A face? A man? Perhaps he fought in a war and got disfigured, surely you can't just...\" I tried to argue.\n\nStanley, however, was quick to silence me.\n\n\"His face was not damaged, no, it was something different... it was...\n\nI just can't.\n\nAfter I had calmed down a bit and had some tea, my thoughts kept wandering back to that accident. Why had the bus exploded? It had just gotten hit. Had anyone survived? Had...\n\nSuddenly I felt a chill run down my spine. Images of the unspeakable grimace appeared before my inner eye. Images of that disturbing man who had stood there so coldly, who had icily gazed at the disaster, and then his gaze shifting to me....\n\nHis look... had found me.\n\nI still felt his stare, despite having left the place of the accident behind. I could still feel him looking at me. Despite the peace that I had found there in my box, despite the peace that the tea had given, ...\n\nThe gaze was still there. It still rested on me, as if the man was still looking at me, watching me, dissecting me with his eyes....\n\nWhy did I still feel it, that look?\"\n\n\"You were traumatized! An accident like that can really throw you off! But that's still...\", I began again, but Stanley cut me off.\n\n\u201cNo! The bad thing is... I stood up, wanting to look out the window, look at the mountains in the distance. My eyes fell on the street, almost accidentally...\n\nAnd there he stood! There on the sidewalk! And he looked up at me! What did he want there? What did he want from ME?\"\n\nStanley ran his hands through his hair, completely distraught.\n\n\"How was I supposed to get out of the building? Surely, I couldn't go through the main entrance, not past\u2026 him! My mind was racing. It was late, so the side entrance was probably already locked! But I had to try. I had to escape from him, from that despicable man! So, I hurried down the stairs, down all those concrete steps. I couldn't take the elevator after all, what if he was waiting right in front of it! I would have been trapped!\n\nI ran down the stairs, down and down. I was lucky, the side door was unlocked and so I squeezed through, into the alley behind the building. I must have been drenched in sweat, but I didn't care. After a quick breather, I made my way home. It was five blocks to my little apartment. Carefully, I approached the end of the alley, fearing that he might be lurking there. I was lucky, he wasn't, and I started to head home...\"\n\n\"Man, this is insane. Why were you so scared? Maybe he was traumatized too and just wanted to...\", I grumbled, but was cut off again.\n\n\"No! No! He was... not normal. He was...\n\nWhen I was on the street, a few feet away from the entrance of the alley, already feeling safe, that's when I saw him. He was leaning out of the alley, behind me, looking at me and giving me that abysmal grin! But how had he gotten there? I don't know... I ran home...\"\n\n\"Wow, that sounds a little freaky! But why didn't you call the police?\"\n\n\"I... I don't know, I was so confused! Maybe I should have. But maybe... he would have noticed the cops too. Would have chased them too if they had confronted him. I don't know. But I don't think they could have done anything against him. He seemed so different, so otherworldly.\"\n\n\"Hmm, I would have tried anyway.\"\n\n\"That might have been better. But somehow I was afraid of harming others...\"\n\n\"Says the guy who pulled a gun on me,\" I laughed bitterly.\n\nStanley blushed.\n\n\"You have to believe me, I just had to make sure to keep going. I don't want him to catch up to me! I would never have hurt you!\" he then stammered.\n\n\"Catch up? Do you think he's still stalking you?\"\n\n\"I know he is! It was the next day, the day after the accident and the dead people... I already hadn't slept well that night, had had terrible dreams, kept seeing that man's eyes in my mind! Thus, I woke up drenched in sweat. Nonetheless, the feeling that he was looking at me loomed over me. I got dressed and headed for the bathroom. As I approached the door, I felt queasy. I was afraid that he was standing there, waiting there for me to...\"\n\n\"Whew, you really got a smack on the head! Why would he...?\"\n\n\"He was there.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nI looked at him in disbelief. His sunken eyes were full of panic and his dirty hair made him look very sick. But his voice seemed to speak the truth.\n\n\"I approached the door, felt his presence, his eyes, his gaze... Slowly, I advanced, towards it. Finally, I tore open the door.\n\nHe was standing there, in front of the mirror, in the middle of the bathroom. Motionless. But I knew he would not remain frozen. I rushed out of the room, driven by terror and instinct. Ran into the underground garage, to my car. And guess what? There he was!\"\n\nHe wiped his forehead, ready to burst into tears again.\n\n\"And then?\" I asked, not believing what I heard.\n\nI did not feel well, Stanley apparently had lost his mind due to the accident, probably had gotten a concussion. Who knew what he was capable of doing at the moment?\n\n\"What do you think? I ran away! Out of the building, onto the street! And... He was standing there as well! How did he get there? How?\n\nI had to flee, flee from this... thing. Away and to safety. I stole a car and drove, drove away, just away! I have been going the whole night long... and again and again I saw him in the rearview mirror, driving a dark car, following me, chasing me. Every time I managed to shake him off. I must have momentary nodded off due to the exhaustion. Hit the tree. Then, you found me and I had to take that chance! I had to! I had to go on, what if he had caught up to me?\"\n\nI looked at the shaking Stanley in disbelief.\n\n\"Seriously?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course! Do you think I am kidding around? Fortunately, I had the gun inside my car...\" he whispered.\n\nI said nothing and looked at the tank meter. We would not get far with the diesel we had left. On the next occasion, I steered my truck down a side road, towards one of the many service stations located in the mountains.\n\n\"What the hell are you doing?\" Stanley stuttered, having turned even more pale.\n\n\"We cannot stop! He will catch up to us!\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, if the tank has completely run dry in a few miles, we will be even more fucked. And stop with this 'man'. You are under shock and stress!\" I shouted at him. We had reached the station and I got out of the truck to refill the tank.\n\nJust as I was about to take the fueling hose, a horrid scream pierced the air, shaking me to the core. It was Stanley's voice.\n\nThe poor lad had finally gone crazy and with terror I heard the roaring of my old truck's engine. Seconds afterwards, the vehicle was speeding past me, leaving me behind in a cloud of dust.\n\nThat guy had fucked me over, telling tall tales! Or he had been madder than I had thought in the beginning! It didn't matter, for I had neither the promised money nor my truck! I cursed again. How could I have been so stupid? Why had I let him into my truck in the first place? With this laughable story? Why did I...\n\nMoments later, I heard the sound of another car, zooming past me, and I my heart almost stopped.\n\nBehind the wheel of the black hearse sat a being, so horrendous that I could not even have dreamt it up in my worst nightmares: A man, pale as a corpse, wearing a dark grey pinstripe suit and a big black top hat. His inhuman face burned itself into my brain, despite me having seen it only for a few moments.\n\nThe eyes seemed big, lidless, and slit-shaped; his wide grinning mouth opening ran from one ear to the other. That smile looked like a part of hell itself.\n\nStaring, the creature sped past my in its car, not having noticed me. And I will forever thank the Lord that it didn't.\n\nIt sped past me, after my truck, and disappeared into the distance.\n\nI am not sure, whether I hallucinated all of said encounter, whether the story of poor mad Stanley had shaken me more than I admit. However, I cannot believe that such a hellish smile has been produced by just my own imagination.\n\nMy old truck was found on the same day. Someone had run it against a rock wall. Yet, the driver was never found, only the bullet holes, deeply piercing the passenger seat...\n\n\\---------------\n\n[Other reports I have found...](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/EbrughReports\/)","64":"I was never really a fan of the saying\u00a0 \"don't judge a book by it's cover.\" Now I'm not saying that you should judge a person entirely based on their appearance, I just feel like you can tell certain things about someone if they're wearing a certain style. But then again, that's just me, you can believe what you want to believe.\n\n\nI live in a rather busy part of town, so I decided to volunteer at the Pumpkin Patch that the community holds each year during the month of October. I been there many times with my family and made lots of good memories so I figured it would be nice to help out. The first few days of volunteering were pretty normal, nothing too exciting. That was until after the first week had passed. My supervisor, Todd, announced that a new person was going to volunteer and wear a scary costume to help \"liven up\" the Pumpkin Patch. Basically serve as a mascot. Todd explained how the person was going to be stationed at different spots where they could take pictures with families. Everyone, including myself, was pretty excited to meet this new person.\u00a0\n\n\nThe next day, we were all waiting outside the Pumpkin Patch to meet the new volunteer. After a while, a gray minivan pulled up, and I instantly got weird vibes but decided to ignore them. The door slid open, and a tall man stepped out. His costume was... interesting... to say the least. He wore a dark red tuxedo with a bright red bowtie around his neck. However, there was a jack-o'-lantern where his head should've been. He walked in front of the crowd and turned to face us. Todd went up next to them with a microphone. \"Everyone, this man has kindly agreed to come stay at the park and take pictures with guests!\" he said in a booming voice \"One by one, you will all introduce yourselves to him, please come talk to me in my office if you need anything\"\n\n\nWith that, he stepped away from the man and walked off to his office. We did as we were told and lined up to meet this new person. As I was waiting, I couldn't help but notice that as Todd was talking, the man did not move an inch, almost as if he was a soldier waiting for an order. I shook it off and continued waiting. When it was my turn, I stepped up to the man.\n\n\nOnce I made eye contact with him, several chills went up my spine. He didn't make any movements yet, and instead looked at me with an unreadable expression thanks to the jack-o'-lantern. I told him my name after a few uncomfortable seconds. He tilted his head as he looked at me, I felt judged. The face that was carved into the jack-o'-lantern was pretty unsettling, it consisted of two gleamy eyes and a sinister crooked smile. Finally, he slowly held out a hand that was covered with a white leather glove. I shook it, and quickly went off to another part of the Pumpkin Patch once I was done. I pretended not to notice the man staring after me before he greeted the next person.\n\n\nAs I was walking, I met up with two of my coworkers who were good friends of mine, Aaron and Katrina. \"Did you two already meet the new guy?\" I asked.\n\nThey both nodded before speaking. \"Yep, that costume's pretty damn terrifying, '' Aaron said as he crossed his arms and leaned against the wall of a snack bar. Katrina looked down at her phone before saying \" Y'know, I could've sworn I've seen those people on TV before, I just don't remember what it was about ''. We all exchanged looks. \" Huh\" I muttered, \"Maybe he's a performer or something\". \"Yeah, maybe\" Aaron said before standing straight and looking at his watch \"I gotta go take care of something, I'll see you two soon\" he said with a wave as he turned around and walked off. Katrina and I waved before turning back to each other and continued to make small talk. After a bit, I decided to tell her how I felt about the masked person. \"I don't want to say this in front of others but, I'm kinda getting bad vibes from that guy, he didn't even tell us his name\" I whispered while checking my surroundings. Katrina raised an eyebrow before saying \"Well he seems like a\u00a0 nice guy to me and maybe he just doesn't like sharing his name, after all it's what's on the inside that counts''. \"Right...\" I muttered. Katrina patted me on the shoulder before saying she had to go. I watched as she left.\n\n\nThe rest of the day went by pretty quickly. When I got home, I decided to try and do some research on the jack-o'-lantern man. Not knowing what to type, I simply put jack-o'-lantern man. A lot of articles about other Halloween events came, but none of them were specifically about him. I clicked on the top one and read through it. As I read, my heart began to pound. The article stated that at another event, several guests had gone missing. The article showed pictures of the last time they were seen. As I looked at the photos, I noticed something in all of the backgrounds. Standing nearly out of frame, was the jack-o'-lantern man. No matter which photo I looked at, he was always standing there, staring at the camera. I read some of the other similar articles and found the same result, guests going missing, and the jack-o'-lantern man standing in all of the photos. I didn't get very much sleep after that.\n\n\nThe next day, I headed to the Pumpkin Patch early before any of my other coworkers. I didn't want to involve the police or anybody else until I was a hundred percent sure that the jack-o'-lantern had at least something to do with the disappearances, and the last thing I needed was for him to know that I was onto him. The Pumpkin Patch felt eerily empty and quiet when there were no guests yelling and talking over each other. I made sure no one was there and made my way to Todd's office to make sure he wasn't there. Sure enough, he wasn't but there was something strange. The door was unlocked, he has never left the door unlocked when he wasn't here. Cautiously, I opened the door and stepped in, it seemed relatively normal, nothing was out of place. I then saw a stack of files on Todd's desk.\n\n\nI closed the door behind me and carefully approached the files. They all held info about everyone at the pumpkin patch, including mine. I looked through the files and saw one that looked out of place. It was smaller and had only one paper in it. I grabbed and opened it, sure enough it was a photo of the jack-o'-lantern man. However, he still had his jack-o'-lantern head on. I read through the paper and barely even found any info about him, not even a name for him. The paper just explained how he worked as a \"Halloween mascot\". Dissatisfied, I put the paper and file back and headed out towards the door. I locked it from the inside and went outside only to bump into someone.\u00a0\n\n\nIt was him, the Jack-o'-lantern man. I bit back a yelp and took a step back as I stared up at him. As he looked down at me, I immediately noticed something different about him. The carving on his \"head\" was different. It was no longer a smile but instead what looked like a mixture between a smirk and a frown. We both stared at each other, not moving or saying anything. I finally found my voice and managed to stammer out \"S-sorry, I just forgot something in Todd's office and needed to grab it.\" He continued staring for what seemed like hours. Folding his hands behind his back, he finally turned around and stalked off towards the middle of the pumpkin patch. I breathed a sigh of relief, he seemed to believe me. I thought about following him but since I was alone, it would be harder to do so without being seen, it would also be even harder considering the fact that he already knew I was here. Deciding to wait until everyone had actually arrived, I went back to my car and grabbed something to eat.\u00a0\n\n\nEventually, most of my coworkers and the guests had arrived. However, Todd never showed, I felt uneasy but brushed it off as him being sick or something. My job was managing the ring toss game and handing out prizes. As the day went on, I could see the Jack-o'-lantern man in the distance taking photos with guests. I kept an eye on him as best as I could. After about 5 hours, my shift was over and Katrina came over to take my place. \"Thanks.\" I called out to her before leaving. As I walked through the Pumpkin Patch I figured I would use my break to find the Jack-o'-lantern man. While I was walking, I was stopped by several people, all of which were asking whether I had seen their family members or friends. I said I hadn't and they all looked really worried. I got more and more nervous as I continued searching. Then, as I reached the corn maze we had, I saw him. The jack-o'-lantern man had walked behind the corn maze, I could see the glow from his head from where I was standing.\n\n\nI silently walked towards the back of the maze, trying not to look too suspicious. Thankfully, this was a rather empty part of the pumpkin patch, which, now looking back at it, just made things even creepier. I turned the corner to see a door close, this door was an old rotting wooden door that nobody was allowed in. I waited a couple of seconds before approaching the door, grabbing the handle and wondering if I should risk opening it. After a while, I took a breath and slowly cracked open the door. I peeked in and only saw darkness. I stepped in, looking around only to see dark walls and a narrow path ahead. I took slow steps heading down the path. As I continued, I noticed that on the dirt ground, there were stange tracks, almost as if something was dragged across it. It sounded like someone was struggling, they were gasping and grunting. I quickened my pace and took shaky breaths. I was beginning to see a bright orange light at the end of the pathway. Knowing that it was the Jack-o'-lantern man, I got as close as I could while still being concealed by the darkness so he wouldn't see me. His back was turned to me and he was staring down. I slowly walked to the side to see what he was staring at, and my blood turned to ice quickly. A man, who looked no older than 25, was on the floor backed against the wall. He was as pale as a ghost and a look of absolute fear was plastered on his face. He had smears of dirt all over his body, the source of those tracks on the dirt floor.\n\n\nHe was shaking and whimpering, pressing himself against the rock wall while the Jack-o'-lantern man just stood there. I took a small step back, then something cracked underneath my shoe. I looked down and saw that it was a bone, a human bone. Sure enough, that caught the attention of the Jack-o'-lantern man and turned to face me. I couldn't move, couldn't even scream as the carving on his jack-o'-lantern head began to morph, change into a completely different facial expression, a taunting one. This wasn't a costume, this \"person\" wasn't even human. I stood rooted there, fully expecting him to come charging at me to attack me. But he didn't, he just stood there with his taunting look. He then turned around once again to face the scared man. Slowly, he raised his gloved hand, for a moment there was nothing. Then I saw the dirt begin to shake. Out of nowhere, multiple green plant-like tendrils ripped themselves out of the ground. They each wrapped around the man's limbs and torso. He began to thrash as the tendrils pulled him down. He was starting to sink into the ground, the plants continued to pull and pull until only his head remained. I didn't wait to see what happened, I whirled around and took off, praying that he wasn't behind me. Thankfully, I didn't hear anything. I burst out the door and leaped over the fence we had, not caring about being seen, I just needed to get the hell out of there.\u00a0\n\n\nI kept driving until I reached my house, I ran inside and locked my door. I made sure all my windows were locked and closed every curtain. I am now sitting on my bed, doing my best pretending not to notice the out of place jack-o'-lantern outside my window. I know it's a jack-o'-lantern, the bright fiery orange light shining through my blinds is unmistakable.","65":"[1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/q7efcm\/one_day_a_bizarre_abandoned_city_spontaneously\/) [2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/q8ntp4\/one_day_a_bizarre_abandoned_city_spontaneously\/) [3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qaxa7o\/one_day_a_bizarre_abandoned_city_spontaneously\/) [4](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qejmk9\/one_day_a_bizarre_abandoned_city_spontaneously\/) [5](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qima6a\/one_day_a_bizarre_abandoned_city_spontaneously\/)\n\n (Apologies for the lapse in posting. We're approaching the end of the story and it's getting harder to tell of what happened. Rest assured, the final part should be out soon.)\n\nI stood there, frozen in place for what seemed like an eternity. None of the others moved, and their expressions didn\u2019t change. I don\u2019t believe they even blinked. Even though every nerve in my body screamed at me not to, I turned around. Behind me I saw a large, humanoid figure standing about ten yards away from me. In the dark, I couldn\u2019t see its features but it must have been ten feet tall, and its entire body shook as it breathed. Nobody spoke a word.\n\nThe creature, still silent, nodded upwards, as if to tell me there was something I needed to see. I looked up and saw that the clouds had been lit up by a dim, violet glow. The glowing was not uniform and seemed to occur in bands, and I realized that it may have been caused by the violet aurora I saw in my earlier dream. I looked back down, and saw that the creature had vanished. Turning around, I also saw that the sergeant and anthropologist had disappeared too. Suddenly, like an extinguished candle, the silver tree went dark.\n\nI closed my eyes, and when I opened them I saw the medic\u2019s face. \u201cWake up.\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to look for the others.\u201d I sat up and asked if the physicist made it through the night. He nodded reassuringly. \u201cHe should be fine. He\u2019s sleeping right now and his body temperature\u2019s returned to normal.\u201d \u201cDid you notice anything...*off* about him?\u201d I asked. The medic tilted his head and gave me a strange look before shrugging. \u201cHe was talking in his sleep. Kept going on about some light being shut off.\u201d\n\nHe walked out of my tent, leaving me to dress myself, ponder my dream and consider his answer. Was the creature I saw the same crow-like being I kept seeing in statues around the city? What, if anything, was the significance of the tree losing its light? Had the physicist experienced the same dream as I had? And why were the sergeant and anthropologist there? I tried to brush the thoughts from my mind, but I just couldn\u2019t. With all the bizarre things that had happened over the last few days, there had to be some sort of explanation.\n\nI exited the tent, and saw the medic cooking something over a gas stove. The linguist seemed to have calmed down somewhat, and was leafing through the book the anthropologist and I had found. I looked towards the dogs, and saw that the physicist was still there, sleeping peacefully under a pile of blankets that the medic must have arranged. The medic turned towards me, and offered a faint smile. \u201cI figured I\u2019d make us something to eat before heading out. The weather\u2019s cleared up, but we\u2019ll need to dig our way out of this place.\u201d\n\nIt was then that I noticed that the doors to the building were open, and what looked to be three feet of snow were blocking the entrance. I sighed resignedly and went to grab a shovel, but the medic rebuked me. \u201cEat first, you don\u2019t want to waste all your energy first thing in the morning.\u201d After a quick pre-packaged breakfast, we set upon shoveling the snow. It was hard work, but with the medic and linguist\u2019s help, we were able to clear a path. \n\nAs I set down my shovel to catch my breath, I noticed that the physicist was awake and watching us. I walked over to him. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d I asked. He smiled weakly. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be better. But we\u2019ll have to leave soon.\u201d \u201cI know, but you\u2019re going to have to stay here. You\u2019re too weak to look for them.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhy would I look for them? I already know where they are.\u201d \u201cIf you know where they, are, then please tell us! We need to find them!\u201d\n\nHis expression turned solemn. \u201cI know you do. All you have to do is find the gathering place, and all shall be made clear.\u201d \u201cWhat gathering place are you talking about and what shall be \u201cmade clear\u201d?\u201d I responded. He sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t put it into words, but you\u2019ll know when you get there. The gathering place is a five-hour walk from here, assuming the snow doesn\u2019t slow you down or you don\u2019t make any stops. It is a large, circular plaza with a frozen pond and a beautiful silver tree in the center.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t respond; instead I merely walked over to the medic, who was unloading supplies from the dogsleds. \u201cHe knows about the tree. What\u2019s more, he says it\u2019s in a \u201cgathering place\u201d five hours away, and that we\u2019ll find the others there.\u201d The medic tilted his head concernedly. \u201cDid he say where it was?\u201d \u201cNo, I think he\u2019s intentionally being vague so that we have to bring him along for directions.\u201d The medic raised his palm to his face resignedly. \u201cI guess we have no choice then. Go check on him and see if he\u2019s fit to make the journey.\u201d\n\nI went back over to check on the physicist. Despite the state he had been in the previous morning, he seemed remarkably healthy. His body temperature, heartbeat, breathing and reflexes were all normal and I noticed nothing wrong about him. The only thing that perturbed me was how he constantly stared into my face throughout the entire procedure, not once looking away even as I pretended to ignore him. I confirmed his health to the medic and he nodded tersely, before heading over to the linguist, who had picked up her book again. \n\nThey exchanged a few words, and she rose, tucking the book into her coat. She walked over to the physicist and I. \u201cYou guys ready to go? she asked. We nodded in unison, and all of us got to packing up camp. By the time we were ready, it was about 9:30 AM. Assuming it took us five hours, that meant we would get there about an hour before sunset, so we would have to make camp at the gathering place the physicist told of, assuming it even existed. With no time to waste, we set out.","66":"previous parts are on my profile \n\nHello, all.\u00a0\n\nSo much has happened since my last post. I am going to try and tell it all in a way that makes sense. Don\u2019t worry as you read it, I am safe now, in a hospital far, far, away from those woods.\u00a0\n\nThe nights where I was stuck injured in my tower were terrible. That thing with it\u2019s light, it would pace in circles on my balcony holding that oh so bright light, taunting me in hoarse whispers. I became practically nocturnal, I couldn\u2019t sleep when it was around. I never caught a glimpse of what was holding the flashlight, the beam was too bright. I didn\u2019t tell anyone either, as I thought I was going crazy from loneliness. I just sat on that twin bed, night after night, watching that thing circle my tower. It was 8 nights that we spent together before it broke the first window.\u00a0\n\nIt was the normal routine, and I was beginning to grow used to it. I think the thing out there knew that I was getting too comfortable, because as I grew slightly drowsy, it shoved the flashlight it carried through the window. The glass shattered, and I screamed. Shards of glass flew at me as I tried my best to cover my head. None of them hit me, thank god.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d That was the first thing I said to the creature the whole time we had interacted. It felt like a loss on my end, don\u2019t know why. The creature didn\u2019t respond, just kept circling as the rush of cool, humid air hit me.\u00a0\n\nThe next morning, I called the forest service, but told them I had been away when the break happened. Two days after the call, a man arrived to fix up the window. His name was Jonathan, and he seemed gruff. We barely talked, though he did fork over some things which seemed wonderful at the time - security cameras, and more ibuprofen, since I had run out prior to that. I had gotten three cameras and set two up overlooking my tower\u2019s balcony, and the other at the base of the staircase.\u00a0\n\nI set the cameras up quickly, the same day I got them. I knew the thing carrying the flashlight would be back that night, and I would have video footage of it, finally something to prove what had happened. By that night, my leg injury was getting much better, and I could venture out into the woods on short excursions, though if I went more than about half a mile down the trails I would regret it on the way back.\u00a0\n\nWaiting for the sun to set, I took another one of my hikes. Curiosity always kills the cat, and I was hoping for another run-in with the creature that I had encountered the day I broke my leg. Perhaps it was just an adrenaline rush from the anticipation of it all, but though I didn\u2019t see anything out in those woods, I had this terribly anxious gut feeling. I turned back before reaching the half mile mark, maybe only 7 minutes into the hike, because the anxiety had started to overwhelm me. By the time I got back to my tower, my breath was shallow and I was beginning to sweat a bit. Not from the exercise of the walk, I should clarify, but from the ball of fear making its home in my lower abdomen.\u00a0\n\nI spent my entire afternoon pacing about the tower and waiting for the sun to go down, continuously checking to make sure that the cameras were still functional. I moved from the side of my bed, to my desk chair to sitting on the edge of my balcony, looking out for anything that could be approaching my tower, waiting for the sun to set. It seemed to take painfully long now that I actually wanted a visit from the creature.\u00a0\n\nSomehow, while sitting on my bed, waiting for that thing, I had fallen asleep. I had been exhausted for weeks, but I was used to that feeling, so I have no idea how it happened. I don\u2019t remember feeling more drowsy than usual, the anxiety caused by my situation had left me feeling much more awake than I should have. But when I woke up it was pitch black outside, with no sign of that creature. I got up and rubbed my eyes, making my way over to the shitty tablet which showed a live feed of the cameras.\u00a0\n\nAll three were mostly grainy black screens. I sighed in relief, then went back to check the clips they had saved because of detected movement. There was a bird which had flown by the east side of my tower, and several animals which went by the camera at the base of the tower but otherwise, nothing. I began to think that maybe something about Jonathan\u2019s arrival, or perhaps the cameras, had scared the creature off. I only had a few moments to believe this, however, before I looked out my window.\u00a0\n\nOut there in the forest, just a pinprick in the distance at that point, was a light. My good mood faded and my heart sank into my stomach. I watched in dread as the light bumbled along the path towards my tower, approaching from the south. I prayed that it\u2019s path would change, but it never wavered on its way towards me. Fear built up as the light got closer and closer, and I had nothing to distract myself from the impending arrival of the creature.\u00a0\n\nWhen it finally arrived, even the cameras could not pick up whatever held that flashlight. It was just a blob of light, making its way up the staircase of my tower. The creature circled me once or twice, before noticing the eastern facing camera. It made a terrible sound, something that definitely wasn\u2019t human and a sound I doubted even animals would make, before I heard the sound of the camera being torn apart, and subsequently tossed off the tower. Shit.\u00a0\n\nAfter tearing the camera down, the light quickly descended the tower and ran into the woods. I was left in a state of pure panic, and went about sending the footage that remained from what the east camera had managed to transfer before being destroyed, as well as from the other two cameras. It took such a long time because of how slow the satellite internet is here, which was incredibly frustrating.\u00a0\n\nIt took two days for the forest service to agree to get me out of that tower the day after the creature arrived, and another three for the helicopter to come and pick me up. Now, and still as I am writing this, there are rangers combing the area looking for whatever was in my tower. I tried to warn them not to, but they never listened to me. I don\u2019t have the nerve to tell them that I don\u2019t think the thing out there is human, and I can only hope that the rangers, and whoever ends up in tower Sierra Romeo stays safe.\u00a0","67":" \n\nThe day I realized my life wasn\u2019t quite normal was the day my first kiss tried to kill me.\n\nGuess it's just one of those things.\n\nTo be fair, this was a whole year ago, so my genius teenage brain was still \u2018under construction\u2019 as Mom puts it, and she seemed human the first ten minutes that I knew her (okay *five*), and right when she grew fangs and tried to murder me, I totally decided she wasn\u2019t worth it. Just because I was born on the road doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m *that* socially inept. \n\nNot *literally* born on the road*,* of course\u2015 Mom bullied Dad into taking her to a hospital for my day of birthage like a normal boring adult\u2015 but I grew up having diapers changed at junky gas stations instead of a junky bedroom and watching bugs suicide themselves against the windsheild instead of a T.V. It\u2019s a pretty sweet life even if it is a bit unconventional. Most kids have a first time they ride a bike. I have a first time I changed the oil. Most kids learn to draw in kindergarten. I learned it bumping along highway 66, chased by a pack of winged psycho monsters bent on flipping over our car and devouring the tasty morsels of flesh inside it.\n\nLike I said, pretty cool.\n\nBut again, this was a year back, I was almost fifteen, and it was late on a Wednesday night, in the middle of June. My parents decided to stop at a crappy Motel 6 just outside Phoenix arizona, and the second we slid open our van doors my arms were sticky with perspiration. \n\nPeter (he\u2019s my younger brother. Level 7 coolness) sprinted straight for the pool, but before he was ten steps from the car, mom spotted him. \u201cSchool night!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe live in a car mom,\u201d Peter called back, \u201cOur schedule is flexible!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Wednesday. That\u2019s a school night.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Mom,\u201d* Peter moaned, which was sorta a dumb argument as it had never worked before.\n\n\u201c*Peter,\u201d* she said back, which was a pretty good argument, because it somehow *always* worked. \n\nUp until this point, I\u2019d just been planning to go help Dad plan our trip the next day, but I decided to step in like a good older brother and help the poor guy. \u201cLet\u2019s all just calm down and look at this rationally,\" I said.\n\n\u201cNo fighting, Reed,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cReasoning out a problem isn't fighting, mother dearest.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s already ten thirty, and it\u2019s time for bed.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in a burning car all day; we\u2019ll drown our motel room in sweat. And I\u2019m pretty sure my knees have forgotten how to bend.\u201d\n\n\u201cReed\u2015\u201d \n\n\u201cPlus we love you so, so, *so* much, and you are the *best-est* mommy ever.\u201d\n\nShe tried to purse her lips, but they twitched up in a smile*. Bingo*. \n\n\u201cMarriane, by the time you finish deciding it\u2019ll be morning,\u201d Dad said. He winked at us as he walked past carrying my sleeping sister. Mom hesitated but finally gave a slow nod.\n\n\u201cRoom five,\u201d she repeated. \u201cAnd I want you up there before I\u2019m done shower\u2015\u201d\n\nBut Peter and I had already ripped our shirts off and cannonballed in.\n\nThat\u2019s just mom for you. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love her and everything, but I figured out long ago that most of her rules are just ways to force us into pretending we\u2019re a regular family in a regular suburban neighborhood with a regular white picket fence like *she* had growing up. Like if we play normal for long enough, we somehow will be.\n\nEven after a full day in a car with A.C abolitionists (both my sisters hate the cold), the sudden shock of chill water hardly hit me. *Sure*, the pool was suspiciously green with algae, but it ran across my skin cool, and comfortable, and perfect.\n\nPeter and I raced each other a couple laps and spent a few minutes seeing who could hold their breath longer (Don\u2019t *worry,* I let him win once as is my brotherly duty.). When our teeth started chattering, we hopped into the hot tub.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t stay long in here,\u201d Peter said, *very* obviously trying not to sound nervous.\n\n\u201cTrue, those jacuzzi bull sharks really sneak up on you,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIf you stay in a hot tub too long, I think you go sterile.\u201d\n\nTo the side of the pool, the light to room five switched off, the last light in the entire building. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this whole motel is sterile,\u201d I said. \u201cI think we\u2019re the only ones here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how you use the word *sterile*.\u201d\n\n\"Language rules are determined by language usage, not the other way around.\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s literally the stupidest thing I\u2019ve\u2015\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t turn around!\u201d I hissed and sucked in my breath.\n\nThe blood drained from Peter\u2019s face. He clenched his hands into anxious fists. \u201cThere\u2019s a gate on the other side of the pool. If we go now, we can get out before it realizes we\u2019re\u2015\u201d\n\n\u201c*What*?\u201d I said, \"No, Petey relax, nothing\u2019s trying to kill us. A girl just came in the gate, like level nine hot I think, but she walked by too fast. Here, let's switch sides so I can see her in the pool.\"\n\n\"But you said not to move!\"\n\n\"Not when I was staring at her. That would make it obvious. Ok ready? Pretend to punch at me and jump this way. Brother\u2019s do that. I think.\"\n\nIt was a real mark of Peter's priorities that his eyes opened wider at the prospect of facing a girl than they had at facing a supernatural monster. \"I'm not looking like an idiot just because you're too scared to talk with her.\"\n\n\"I'm not\u2015 That isn't\u2015\" I flustered around for words, then\u2015\"fine. *Fine.* FINE*.\" Because I'm not scared*. I slid out of the hot tub and back into the pool. *Because it's just a girl and why should I be scared?*\n\nI made a show of swimming a few laps, before I finally drifted over to where she was dangling her feet in the water. If she wore a swimsuit, I couldn't tell, because an enormous shirt covered her down to her mid thigh\u2015Probably one she\u2019d gotten from a possessive boyfriend, but it\u2019s collar was frayed with age, so no need to worry about him.\n\n\u201cUh, hey,\" I said from the water. *Just a girl. Just a girl.* \u201cYou're a late sleeper too?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Lydia,\u201d she said.\n\n*Names. That's good isn't it? This isn't hard.*\n\n\u201cReed,\u201d I said, and pulled myself up onto the cement next to her. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty brave being out here at this hour.\"\n\n\u201cMy brother and I are on our way to Pennsylvania,\u201d she said. I waited for her to elaborate. She didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cSo Miss Lydia,\u201d I said, and scooted a bit closer, more confident. Behind her the large illuminated Motel 6 sign flickered in the dark. \u201cWhere is it that you and your brother are coming from? *Wait,* Lemme guess. You\u2019re driving home from a modeling gig in NYC?\u201d\n\nShe giggled.\n\n\u201cKnew it,\u201d I said. \"I didn\u2019t even need psychic powers to figure that one out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Lydia,\u201d she said.\n\n*Okay then..*. \n\n\u201cCool. That\u2019s\u2015well, it's a nice name, huh.\u201d\n\nShe inched nearer towards me, and my heart sped up. \u201cMy brother and I are on our way to Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\n*Huh...*\n\nI glanced back up at the flat wall of hotel rooms. Still no lights were on. When was the last time an entire motel was asleep before midnight?\n\nLydia giggled and leaned her face towards mine.\n\nStill smiling, I scanned the parking lot. It wasn\u2019t empty like I\u2019d expected, which was a good sign but... *but crap,* I realized, *crap, crap, crap.* There was a pattern to it. Why hadn't I realized it before? White car, black car, red car. White car, black car, red car. The three same cars, same color, same model, same everything, repeated over and over around the entire lot. \n\nLydia was close to me now. *Very* close. I glanced over her shoulder again at the streetlamp-tall **Motel 6** sign, and sure enough, I\u2019d breezed over it the first time too much to notice. As bright as the \u20186\u2019 was, that was all that was lit up, no 'Motel' anywhere, not to the side, not at the bottom, nowhere. Which meant this wasn\u2019t a **MOTEL 6.** This was just a\u2026 **6.**\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Lydia,\u201d she said again.\n\nNo *wonder* she was a level nine hotness.\n\n\u201cWell good to meet you Lydia,\u201d I said and started easing away. \u201cOur shared relationship has been a pleasure for it\u2019s cursory duration, but it's a school night so I\u2019ve really got to\u2015\u201d\n\nAnd then, she pounced at me.\n\nLet\u2019s pause for a moment shall we? Now, I know I said this was my first kiss, and I know some of you are seriously doubting my reliability at the moment, but I assure you, in the midst of her attacking me, and biting at me, and altogether attempting to rip me apart as sometimes happens as a result of small talk, there were definite moments where her face was right on mine. So it totally, definitely counts as a kiss. I've even got the cheek scar to prove it.\n\nIt was hard to get a great look as she pummeled me, but I knew she\u2019d changed like other mimics changed. Her face expanded to the length of a spare tire, her teeth sharpened into butcher knives. Every time she clawed me, a line of metal nails raked across my skin, and as hard as I struggled, she thrashed me into the water with unnatural strength. This time the pool wasn\u2019t exactly *refreshing*. My skin burned where it\u2019d been raked apart. I didn't have time to take a breath before she was forcing me down, down, down\u2015\n\nWhen we reached the bottom of the pool, I pressed my back against the floor and kicked up with my legs. She grabbed them and threw them down with impossible force. My lungs were on fire. I couldn't see. Every time I scrambled upwards, she yanked me back.\n\nWhy hadn't I listened to Mom?  Every instinct screamed at me to take a breath, to get air to my lungs. Why hadn't I gone to bed? Which direction was up? My will was slipping. I was going to inhale whether I let myself or not. The mimic was going to kill me. I was going to drown. I was going to\u2015 \n\nAnd then she was off me. \n\nI scrambled over the edge of the pool and gasped for air. Lydia snatched at my ankle, but I kicked hard at her hand, and it jerked back. My vision blurred at the sides, but each raspy inhale brought me more and more alert\u2015 alert enough to make out Peter screaming and thrashing in the water.\n\n*Bad to worse.*\n\nAt least I knew why she\u2019d let go.\n\nHe was doing better than I had. He gripped the side of the pool and kicked at Lydia's face, but he was slipping fast. It was amazing Peter wasn\u2019t frozen in shock by now, but I had to get help. I had to get Dad\u2015 \n\n\u201c*REED*!\u201d Peter screamed.\n\n*No time.* I had to do something or he\u2019d drown. I needed\u2015\n\nMy eyes latch onto something. A pool skimmer with leaves caked into the net. Perfect.\n\nI sprinted forward and seized it from the fence. \u201cPetey, watch out!\u201d I raised the pole like a spear, and without time to think, without time to consider the idiocy of my plan, I leapt at Lydia in the water. \n\nPeter dove sideways just as the girl and I collided. My knees buckled atop her back, but I jammed the blunt end of the pole against her head. It dented inwards like plastic, enough to kill any regular person\u2015 but not a mimic.\n\nI reached the edge of the pool as she oriented herself for another attack, but this time I was prepared. I rammed my javelin against her forehead. Then again. And again. And again, and\u2026 \n\nFinally, she was just floating there, her entire head concaved inwards. A dollar-store baby doll when you clench its face too hard. Misshapen. Waxy. Undoubtedly a mimic. Black ichor oozed into the water around her. I panted and clutched my leaf skimming pole, waiting for her to come at me, to twitch, to move, to do anything. When she didn\u2019t, I dragged myself out of the pool onto the cement next to Peter.\n\n*Just a two now,* I decided and swallowed back my vomit*, just a two hotness.* \n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I gasped. Peter was curled rigid and white-faced against the fence, a ball of nerves\u2015 *but alive,* I reminded myself. *Alive.*\n\n\u201cReed, I think this place is a forgery,\u201d he said.\n\nI half laughed, half sputtered up water. \u201cWhat tipped you off?\" *How* had I not realized before? We were probably the only human occupants here. \"Stay and catch your breath. I\u2019ll go get the rest of them before another mimic tries to offer them room service or something.\u201d\n\nSo I calmly informed my family we were in a death trap, they *calmly* packed our things, and pretty soon, we *calmly* drove across the street to the actual **Motel 6** we\u2019d looked up on Google Maps. \n\nA little odd, I know, the fact we weren't screaming for the cops or burning **Motel 6** to a crisp (*sorry*, I mean burning the ***6*** to a crisp), but mimics are pretty basic hazards of the road. Easy ones. You *don\u2019t* freak out. You *don\u2019t* attack first. And you *definitely* do not act like anything is wrong. As long as you seem oblivious, they\u2019re hard-wired to treat you relatively normal for a bit, and if you get away from them quick enough, they're completely harmless. \n\nYou know, harmless like Lydia.\n\nSo *yes*. There're a few, little, tiny things that are different about my life on the road, but it\u2019s basically the same. \n\nJust a little better. \n\nAnd at least, I never have to deal with school nights. \n\n[MORE](https:\/\/www.wattpad.com\/1152788175-the-highwayman-chapter-1)","68":"As a kid, you're much vulnerable. Young and small. Naive. I was 8 when it happened. My brother was 13. We live in a very religious christian household. My parents were against all those spirit boards and tarots, anything to do with witchcraft and spirit communication. Although my brother and I weren't as religious as our parents. So we didn't care. Or atleast my brother didn't. \n\nI don't know when it happened but probably sometime around winter. My parents went to the hospital to watch over our grandma, leaving me and my brother home alone. My brother, being the social butterfly he was, brought over a couple of his friends to play games and whatnot. I was the total opposite of that. I didn't like people and preferred staying in my room. So I did. And they spent the whole night laughing and yelling at each other. I didn't sleep at all. \n\nIt was until 3am, I saw the lights go off outside the bedroom me and my brother shared. We lived in a 2 bedroom apartment. So we had to share by using bunk beds. \n\nIt was unusually quiet. Too quiet, I didn't go to sleep like I intended. I stepped out of the room and saw my brother and his friends, gathered around a spirit board with candles lit around them. One of his friends asked \"Do you want to join us?\" \n\nAs a kid, I was fascinated by things like spirit boards. I liked learning about the dead. But I was scared. Instead of accepting the offer, I said, \"No, I'll just watch\" \n\nI sat by my brother, desperately trying to stay close to him, afraid of the unknown. It was a bit boring. Not much activity happened. Even if it moved, I was convinced that one of the boys were doing it. \n\nUntil the candles blew away. \n\nWe sat there in the darkness silent. I started crying, I hated the dark so much. In my bed? sure, there was a blanket protecting me from whatever I thought was there. But in the middle of the living room? I was trembling. \n\nOne of the guys tried to find their phone in their pocket. But they couldn't find it at all. \n\nWe all remained silent, only the sound of heavy breathing and me crying in the dark. I felt a tug on the back of my shirt. I don't know what happened but, I just stood up and started walking to my parents room. Like something was leading me in there. And once I was inside the room, the door behind me slammed shut, clicking in lock. \nI snapped to my senses I started banging on the door, begging for someone to let me out. I thought they were pulling a prank on me but once the light turned on in the living room, and they started trying to open the door, I knew there was something wrong. \n\nI felt a presence with me. And I mistakenly looked back. \n\nIt was dark. But there was enough moonlight to see what it was. In the corner of the room, there was a man\u2014no, a creature. His skin was sickly pale, no life in them. His fingers were long and sharp, skinny and bony. He wore a tophat and a black suit, the red tie around his neck vibrating off the whole attire. And his eyes. I wish I never saw them. \n\nThey were black sockets. Black tar oozing out of them, slowly dripping down his face. They were so lifeless, and yet, it stared deep into me. He stared back. I only started screaming louder when his lips formed to a grin, revealing yellow sharp teeth, tainted with what it seemed like blood. \n\nIt doesn't sound scary but imagine an 8 year old locked inside a dark room, trapped with a creepy man who looked like a demon. \n\nMaybe he was just an imagination? \n\nNo, it couldn't be. I never had an imaginary friend. \n\nTo me it was all real. And it only got realer when he started walking. Slowly. Step by step, to me. I fell to the floor and hid under my parents coat stand, rocking back and forth and sobbing. I heard his footsteps only get closer and closer until the door slammed open and the lights went off. \n\nMy brother took me from under the coat stand, comforting me. I looked around. The man wasn't there anymore. But I kept it to myself. Who would believe an 8 year old child who was scared of the dark? They'd think their imagination was just running wild. \n\nBut nonetheless, my brother's friends were so shook, they stayed for the rest of the night, afraid that the same thing will happen to them. I slept beside my brother until the sun lit the living room through the curtains. \n\nI stuck with my brother all day, scared and traumatised of what happened. I assure myself it wasn't real. \n\nBut I remembered, we didn't get to say goodbye. \n\nMy parents came home in the afternoon. As my mom finished changing, she left their room and said, \"what did you two do in our room? There's some black liquid on the floor.\" \n\nThen I remembered his eyes. \n\nAfter that, I slept beside my brother every night until we moved and I got myself praying every night and got help from my aunt who was a clairvoyant. \n\nI never saw him again.","69":"I am writing this out of fear that I am no longer coherent of my actions. I swear I'm not a bad person. I'm not perfect, but I am still human. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't the best growing up. It was all out of curiosity, and I can promise that. Sticking things in outlets, drawing on the walls, pushing kids off playgrounds, and the list goes on. I would never do anything out of malicious intent. It was always sheer curiosity and I genuinely mean that.\n\n  Never had trouble making friends, granted I was that kid that stuck a stick in the tire spokes just to see what happens. This was in a figurative and literal sense. When I started noticing my actions were putting the spotlight on me at school I started keeping those thoughts strictly to personal time. The intensity died down for a little bit. By that time I was just getting in trouble whenever my dad found his watches not working. I wasn't too good at putting things back together and making them work again.\n\n  Towards the end of elementary I was fascinated with the microwave. An instrument that vibrates water to the point where it warms things up? I was most definitely intrigued. Metal was always fun to watch with all the sparks just as long as you took it out before it melted a hole in the microwave. The dry stuff always went up in flames so stayed away from those. Can't wipe away melted plastic with a rag.\n\n  One day I had the bright idea of throwing one of my GI Joes in the microwave when I was walking home from school until I saw a kitten. I know what it sounds like, but I'm not a bad person. Not saying I wasn't right for doing so, but I wasn't necessarily wrong. I was just a curious kid. I just wanted to see what would happen and that's when I knew I needed to keep my thoughts to myself.\n\n  My parents didn't know what to do with me. They were broken at the thought I was a little psychopath. They figured sending me to my room for the night was best as they talked about counseling and military school. At the end of the day they knew I was just a little different. Woke up the next morning with the microwave replaced and my parents trying to pass it off as a phase. Don't recall them ever bringing it up again.\n\n  From there forward I vowed to keep my thoughts as only thoughts, and it made my life that much easier for the time being. Especially during presentations when the teacher would say, \"just imagine everyone in their underwear.\" Imagine if I went around stripping everyone down just to be comfortable enough to present in front of the class. That would be absurd. I'd walk past students on campus playing out slapping kids' lunch trays out of their hands and kicking their food, but I just smiled as I passed by and wished them a good day.\n\n  My thoughts got really invasive after getting my license. I couldn't help but picture veering into the oncoming vehicle. Leaving myself and the family of five twisted and mangled in the wreckage after colliding like two insignificant atoms. Only to be forgotten within a few cycles of life as if it had never happened to begin with. Hell of a thing to think about while on the road, but it's no different than taking my car on the sidewalk and seeing how physics would work out in a live action Grand Theft Auto game. They're all just thoughts though.\n\n  College had to be the hardest. Always trying to fit in regardless if your morals agreed with the way they conducted themselves. Hazing was easy. I just thought about different ways I'd get out of certain rituals like I was being captive or something. It got interesting when I was the one that did the hazing since I got to explore my thoughts without feeling like I was different. I can see why people participate in these rituals. They all have thoughts and need an outlet like myself.\n\n  We never did anything too eccentric, and I did my best to stay away from the booze if we did. I was already the Willy Wonka of hazing, so I needed to make sure every avenue I explored was processed accordingly so I knew what I was doing was just that. One of our, \"brothers,\" ended up ruining it for everyone in the frat. He wanted to get an easy lay with the girl from economics class and asked for some help. I thought about throwing something real strong in her drink, but told him it would probably be best to just have a good time and let it unfold itself. She was into him anyway.\n\n  She overdosed that night and they pinned it all on him. He was drunk and passed out no later than nine then woke up with her cold dead body next to him. I know I kept that thought to myself, so for him to do what he did was uncalled for. Should have just thought about it like I did. After that, I needed my space again. Finished up college and put it all in the past.\n\n  I ended up getting an apartment in the city with a little desk job that doesn't even utilize my degree. I thought it'd be best to get rid of the car to minimize those intrusive thoughts and just stick to public transportation. I think it made things a little easier. The city made my mind fold on itself while it tried to process every outcome that could bloom from interacting with every passing person. It helped keep things manageable as I walked past that man in a suit and slid a box cutter across his inner thigh. Everyone crowded around him as he took a few steps before noticing the blood trailing behind him and I just continued on with my day. Just as a thought as it should be.\n\n  Today I've come to the conclusion that the term, \"going postal,\" didn't sit well with me. Not that I didn't like the term, but it rarely had to do with a post office. I don't work at one, so if I did decide to follow through with smacking my coworker in the back of her head with my keyboard, then proceed to repeatedly slam her face into the monitor. I wouldn't consider that, \"going postal,\" by any means. Maybe a cubicle rage? Regardless, I didn't like working there anyway. Especially when your cold hearted boss lives next door to you.\n\n  I decided to take the train home and it was just one other person beside me waiting for it to arrive. I saw the light in the tunnel and I couldn't help but wonder what would happen if that stranger just happened to fall in front of the train. My imagination got the best of me as I gave them a little shove right before the train passed and just got on board. I didn't catch what cart they got on, but who wants to share a cart with a stranger if you don't need to? I wouldn't want to sit next to me so I couldn't blame them.\n\n  Following the normal routine, I got home, kicked off my shoes, popped a TV dinner into the microwave, and turned on some evening news to end the night. While I was grabbing my food out of the microwave I heard the reporter speaking on someone being pushed in front of a train being caught on video. I immediately turned off the TV because that couldn't have been me. I've been doing so well at keeping my thoughts to myself. I thought about cutting that guy with the box cutter, so why was there blood on the blade? I must have cut myself at some point.\n\n  I can't shake the feeling I was fired after beating my coworker senseless, but I know I quit because my boss was a micromanaging powerhouse and got on me about daydreaming all day. I just know the thought of me kicking in her door, grabbing the degree off the wall that she so often talked about, and beat her with it until the glass shards and wood splinters were embedded in her face was just a thought. The blood smearing across this paper would say otherwise. Along with the banging on the door. Does this mean I really did all those things I just thought about? They keep saying they're cops and my door sounds like it's about to get kicked in, so I hope whoever comes in finds this letter. I can honestly say, I didn't mean to do it. They were simply just thoughts.\n\nSincerely,","70":"[Part 9](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qp54p0\/the_siren_game_part_9\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\"Everything you saw was inside you\".***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoctor Lektor was sitting in Amir's desk, his legs crossed, coffee held in his right hand. Just a couple hours after my odyssey into the woods, I was back at civilization. Despite barely getting some sleep, I was fueled by a corrupted and dangerous energy, feeling the strange compulsion to tell my twisted tale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNodding and making notes, the doctor listened to me for hours. He was completed immersed in the description of each and every detail. When my narration came to an end, it was now time for him to dissect my bad trip. Of course, first he reminded me: those horrors I had faced were just a product of the darkness inside my mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"That wasn't LSD, right?\", I asked, still shocked.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"No\"**, simply answered the doctor. After finishing his coffee, he continued his analysis, just as if the pictures displayed by my mind were a work of art. Twisted and bleak art. Just like I used to do during my classes, so did he now, my *subconscious* the research object.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"What's evident is that you feel the need to be** ***punished*** **. You need that before even considering the chance to** ***forgive*** **yourself\", he continued. \"And each and every time, you create a** ***fantasy*** **, some sort of imaginary landscape, where you somehow suffer a similar** ***fate*** **that of Camille. And your libido... I wonder, what was the last time you had sex?\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wasn't really comfortable around women, nor was I when sex was the topic of the day. Funny though: I was now starting to understand why. To be honest, I would have been extremely angry at the idea of speaking about my sexuality with some stranger. But the doctor was, after all, a doctor. My therapist. There was an obligation, a bond of some sort, even if there was a demon hiding beneath that dark blue suit of his.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I... About six months, I think...\", I answered nervously. Dr. Lektor could taste my discomfort. He smiled while nodding, me being devoid of humanity before his eyes. I was being examined through some sort of detective work were science was the main actor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Tell me more\", he demanded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Uh... Oh... Shit\u2026\", I mumbled nervously. He smiled with his trademark grin, which I had trouble defining. He was truly difficult to figure out: was he enjoying this? Or was he just excited due to how interesting as a patient I was? Somehow I thought he was thinking both things. But I couldn't talk about this without feeling shame. Now more than ever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"J... Julie...\", I stammered in a dry whisper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Julie? The student? Your student? The one that was giving you a fellatio during the trip, after the twins told you th...?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"YES, JULIE\"**, I interrupted him nervously. My breathing was heavy, accompanied by a tachycardia that surprised me with abrupt coughing. The doctor let out a small chuckle, always smiling. \"Sorry...\", I excused myself. He nodded, recovering his inexpressive yet serious demeanor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"It's ok. I'm not here to *judge* you. You can tell me. If you want, of course. It would be wise to do it, don't you think?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat didn't leave me with much of a choice, right? There was a subliminal threat in his speech. But to be fair, he was right. Again. We had to carefully analyze what was going on inside my mind. I needed to heal. To be better. This helped, even if I was completely embarrassed by the idea of talking about my sex life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I... We... She was my student during a semester. She was very bright. We hooked up during... Shit... We dated. Briefly. We had sex a couple times...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"And how was your performance?\", he asked with complete professionalism. I couldn't. No. It was too much. Too personal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I had trouble... Getting an erection... Somehow... There was something wrong. But I finally did it. And we had a great time. Kinda... I couldn\u2019t always ejaculate\u2026\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere. I did it. I finally opened up. I was terrified of being made fun of. That was one of the many reasons I avoided shrinks. Furthermore, looking back at my brief affair with Julie I was scared of how I was going to be judged. Was it right or wrong? Did I abuse my position? My authority? The whole situation had made me reflect upon things I hadn't questioned before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But it... I mean... She was 21... We liked each other... You... It's not like I corrupted...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Relax. Ok?\" he said calmly. \"Again: I'm not here to judge you. You were two consenting adults. Personally, I wouldn't have done it, but it isn't my place to give that kind of advice\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat did he really think of me? Yes, he was some weird individual with a God complex and, if he was telling the truth, a serial killer gone vigilante. But I wanted to do right. His opinion mattered to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"And you haven't had sex since then? Interesting. I know you must have doubts about that erotic scene, seeing your mother, those two bullies...\", he continued. With every word, my patience started to shiver in rage. **I didn't want this. I wanted to wake up.** Soon his monologue turned into muffled voices, my mind drifting into an anxiety attack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"It is remarkable how your repressed sexual energy sublimates into...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"PLEASE. STOP. Please, doctor. Just stop!\"**, I interrupted him again. I didn't need to hear that. I was just looking for answers, for a way to be cleansed from the influence of the **game**. And from the **guilt**, which was heavy yet slowly rationalized by my tired mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Fine. Fine\", he nodded with his dead eyes set on me. \"We are getting straight to the point then, little mouse. Just tell me about the one thing that has mostly shaken you about this experience of yours\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe didn't seem angry. No. There was something odd about him. Did I offend him? I had more trust in the doctor, even if I had just met him. But I was still scared of how would he react. Was he a volatile predator? Or was he just toying with me, waiting for the right moment to strike?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"You spoke about** ***forgiveness*** **... Do you think... I can be forgiven? Or is that just a desire that will never be... Fulfilled?\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith a swift movement, he stood up and walked towards one of the windows. After gazing at the sunny yet gloomy day, he looked back at me and smiled. I started to think the doctor had only two facial expressions: that fake smile, a mix of joy and demonic irony, and his blank countenance, the one where no apparent emotion was projected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"There are different paths to forgiveness. But not all lead to** ***mercy*** **\u201d**, he explained. I looked at him with complete attention, and after a brief silence, he started to elaborate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou have **the legal one**: laws, advocates, juries, judges and such, they will determinate the severity of your offence. Then they will give you a sentence and, after it is over, you'll be forgiven. You'll have settled the balance right.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I don't believe in that\", I said with a calm melancholy. \"Me neither\", he answered. \"The main reason is there\u2019s another path. **The social path**, which goes hand in hand with the legal one. For example, let's say you are a child molester. You are convicted, you do your time, you are catalogued in a sex offender registry and then you get out. The system has forgiven you, but how about society? How about the victims? The public eye has a hard time forgiving, a harder time forgetting.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Society can't forgive me...\", I lamented. The doctor started walking to his desktop slowly and finally sat in his chair. \"Perhaps. But there are other paths that, in your case, are far more important\", he suggested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Which other paths?\", I demanded to know, dead *hope* burning inside my heart. If there was a slight chance at redemption, I needed to know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Well, the one that really would make the difference is completely out of bounds for you, my dear friend. That's **the victim path**, but there's no way you can talk to Camille. Not in real life: only in dreams and hallucinations.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat hurt more than you think. My gut clenched like a furious fist and I let out a sad and shaky breath.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Camille... I would never be forgiven. There wasn't a way.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Then you have **the God path**\", he continued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I don't believe in God\", I said, sounding like an edgy teenager. \"That's ok\", the doctor quickly followed. \"But you must know it is very important. Being forgiven by a superior being, real or not, can make the difference. That's why it is important when, for example, treating addictions. The AA steps...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLektor made an abrupt pause and looked at me in silence, a small grin drawn on his face. He knew this was upsetting me. After reclining his chair, he started tapping his fingers on the desk, making a slow yet annoying rhythm. It was as if he wanted to make me realize that my lack of patience wasn't good. But after a necessary silence, he finally talked:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"You have only one choice left:** ***the personal path*** **. Only** ***you*** **can forgive yourself and learn how to live with it. Only you can heal.\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere. He said it. Somehow, I knew this was coming. **\"You must seek, not hide\"**, had said the Watcher during my dark trip. What if part of facing this was forgiving myself? What if I acknowledged the good in me? I wanted to do good. But somehow, it didn't felt right. What the doctor said before was true: I needed to suffer in order to start forgiving myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"I need to testify\"**, I said while gazing at campus through the window, like lost within a dream. \"I understand everything you say, doctor. And the quickest and fairest way to a cleansing punishment is facing the consequences. Going to the authorities\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"So you aren't you suffering enough?\", asked the doctor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"No... I need *real* punishment. Like Detective Loki said... Rules, regulations, laws...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe doctor scoffed with ironic laugh. I was truly pathetic, praying for a redemption that was way beyond my grasp. Somehow, I knew I wasn't fully aware of the situation, but the doctor would make sure I could see the whole picture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Why don't you just sign the papers? Why don't you just say I'm not insane? That way, I can go on record. All this burden...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Ok. I'll sign them\", answered the doctor with complete calm and seriousness. **\"But tell me, what do you think is going to happen?\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was petrified by his simple answer. What would happen after my confession? It couldn't be that easy. While my idiot stare kept looking at Dr. Lektor waiting for a cue, he stood up and walked right in front of me, his face with a hint of scorn. Was he furious? I couldn't read him. Then, with his always present superiority, he started lecturing me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"**EXHIBIT A:** you are deemed sane, you testify and Jason pays. But you would still be experiencing visions, outbursts of depression, suicidal rage. Then I would have misdiagnosed and you, little mouse, you would be actually insane. Jason's out, his dad clean. My career ruined. And you? Straight to the madhouse. For life.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTremors, racing through my body. God, I was so stupid. Always sorry. Always feeling bad about myself. The doctor was now speaking with genius level speed, examining every possible scenario with the compulsive madness of a man that was far beyond the rules of society.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"**EXHIBIT B:** you are deemed sane, you testify but Jason's father pulls the strings. No one believes you. They ask for a \"second opinion\". The get you another professional who either diagnoses you with mental illness due to the things you feel and see, or just says you are insane because he's on Jason's payroll. You end up in an asylum, again. And I, tainted, again.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis speech was starting to get dressed by a suit of well-kept rage and disgust. He pitied me, as he did with those who were sheep. I was scared. Of his intelligence, of his unpredictability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"**EXHIBIT C:** my favorite one. You don't even make it to court. Jason's father silences you. And that means ending your life. Plus, everyone you love. Then, every loose end is tied up. That includes me. And I am a man who appreciates a quiet life...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wanted to make him stop. To let him know he was right. But I couldn't, afraid of his reaction. So I listened, his scenarios a knife to the remnants of my pride.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But if you decide to testify, little mouse, then better start thinking about what you are going to say. Plan carefully, and also have in mind **you are going to hurt a lot of people**. You've made your best friend accessory to the crime. Are you aware of that? Detective Loki is involved too...\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was a fool. An idiot. A selfish and pathetic asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"Do you understand now?\"**, the doctor asked, his face now close to mine, his hands resting in my armchairs. His hair was messy and his hazel eyes completely possessed by dilated pupils that made him look like a true hunter. Yet his face was still blank, bare of all sign of humanity. I was cornered, like one of his murderous preys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"I'm sorry...\"**, I whispered. I was unable to move, on the brink of tears caused by the unspeakable horror of death. This was real, making me realize how much I wanted to live. The doctor kept his serious demeanor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"Don't be. You have to stop being sorry\", he said to me, while slowly backing up. I could feel his breathing, jaded, tense. \"You keep saying that. You keep feeling sorry. You said that to Camille ten years ago, and you keep saying that to her in dreams. She even whispered that to you in your psychoactive-fueled fantasy. But that was only you, reversing the roles. \"I'm sorry for this\", \"I'm sorry for that\". You repeat it like a prayer, each and every time you are cornered. You need to own it, little mouse. You need to fail. You need to upset people\".**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter recovering his usual calmness, the doctor approached his desk and sipped from a glass of water. I had been really close to seeing his true self, and that was something he didn't want to let out. His urges repressed, he rested his back on the wall beside the window and looked at me with his ominous grin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"Session is over. But before I let you go, there are two important things I have to let you know. First, I've contacted the lead programmer of The Siren Game. He's here\".**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHAT? What was that?! What? How? Dr. Lektor realized how stupid I looked after this reveal, his ironic grin bigger than ever. I tried to find my voice, but just a nervous wheeze came from the back of my throat. \"Here\u2026?\", I asked with difficulty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"*Here* in the country I mean. He's from Poland, but the game was developed by an international small team. Anyway, I'm arranging a meeting with him. He's upstate. Oh, and as soon as your friend isolates the audio, have him forward the files to me, ok?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Siren. Blood. Limbs. Knives. Sadness. Death.** ***Camille*** **.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt all flashed before me very quickly, like an epileptic display of neurological fireworks. I closed my eyes and gasped for air, the doctor slowly approaching me. I was ok. I needed to be ok. I needed to be strong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"And the other thing?\", I asked, feeling a faint oppression in my neck that activated a slight drowsiness in me, followed by a sudden heartburn. A moment of silence, a break in the tension, a deep breath and now I was back in focus. I looked at my therapist, who kept grinning in strange delight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"The other thing, well...\", he said and then raised his right hand at me, snapping his finger afterwards. No... Was that...? What was he trying to do? Suddenly I felt cold: was the hypnotic control of my orgasmic capacity still tied to that stupid cue?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What... Are you...?\", I couldn't finish asking my question due to my surprise. Nothing happened, the doctor grinning like never before. The change in his humor made me feel uneasy. He was really beyond my comprehension.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I just needed to check if you had done the other part of your homework. I'm glad to see you heard Samantha's tape. Now it's pretty clear why she manifested in your visions\". *Joking* . The doctor was joking. And it made me cringe. It was so out of character. But what if that was his way of trying to apologize for what had previously happened?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I'm ... Ok ...\", I mumbled. I was perplexed. In less than a few hours I had survived a psychedelic nightmare, had been given an angry lecture by the awry doctor, had learned that an actual programmer involved in *The Siren Game* was only a few miles away and now... A joke. A sick but stupid joke. Life was going too fast for me: I wish I could have slowed it down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I'm positive you are going to the game tonight, right? Amir told me it's quite the event\", he asked. The game. No, not *that* game. Another one; a happy one. Tonight was important: the high school basketball team facing its sworn rival, a ritual I haven't seen in years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Yes, I promised him and Sarchie. I'll go\", I told him before leaving the office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Good. Everyone needs to see you are making progress. And also, make sure you start taking the pills right away, ok?\", he said. I nodded without even looking at him, and then I left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was even more confused than before, but there was something enlightening after this strange therapy. The trip had left a mark, but this aftermath... The break down of its scenes and the discussion about forgiveness... They were even more punishing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Good. I needed this. I needed to** ***suffer*** **.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack home, I decided to check my messages. I had already spoken with Amir and Sarchie the morning after my trip, on my way to the doctor's office. Amir was still worried about Paul's death, but he was still pleased about my sessions with the doctor. Sarchie answered me with a simple text: \"I' have your back. Always\". That made me sob with small happiness for the first time in weeks. I wasn't alone. Yet that wasn't enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSleep came to me soon, while sitting in the sofa and thinking about Camille. And the Siren. And the visions. The last effects of the psychedelic drug were fading, now being slowly replaced by the usual medication. Soon I felt a quiet, the relaxing soothe of the autumn breeze mixed with the doctor's prescription. I was gone before realizing it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had some good hours of rest before the phone rang and woke me up: Ian. **The audio was almost isolated.** I told him about forwarding the files to the doctor as soon as he was finished. Things were starting to come around, or so I thought. Night had already arrived, the time for me to assist to one of the most important social events of the year, even if I wasn't feeling like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Back to school.** Shit. Last time I was here, I broke down in front of half town. Now, with a clear head, I felt a little bit of embarrassment about my reaction during Camille's memorial. Fortunately, everyone greeted me with warmness, worried about my health. I just nodded and gave back fake compliments, feeling dead inside: no one knew I was a *horrible* human being. No one except for Amir and Sarchie, who were waiting for me at the bleachers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe gym was packed, this being such an important event for our hometown. Every year, testosterone fueled teens would clash in a game like no other. Both rival teams would face in an exhibition game before the season start. But make no mistake: despite being a friendly match, it was also a demonstration of pride, *manhood* and talent, and also of tradition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"No matter what happens: I believe you. I'm with you till the** ***end*** **, ok?\"**, said Sarchie to me while the pre-game performance made people cheer. \"How are you feeling now?\", he asked, his feet dancing restless due to nicotine withdrawal. The \"NO SMOKING\" signs were his worst enemies ever since high school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Better. Still processing things though. I... There's so much to do... **And just look at the motherfucker...**\", I answered, suddenly stammering due to what I was now seeing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe three of us looked at the center of the court: the PA system was announcing the sponsors, Jason and his father being the stars of the night. People cheered as the announcer gave welcome to the \"future senator\", who greeted the people like a *true* politician. A fake and corrupt one. This was an important night for the town: he needed to be there, smiling. **Acclaimed.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"That fucker...\", mumbled Sarchie while shaking his head. We both knew what was going on. After they went back to their seats, Jason looked to our direction and finally noticed us. Our eyes merged in mutual detestation. The lawyer smiled and then pointed his hand at me, doing a finger gun, the silent bang coming out of his poisonous mouth. **Pathetic.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"... And that motherfucker too\"**, said Sarchie, this time looking at our local team. Amidst the young players, Nick sat as the coach, his nostalgia for high school quit evident. With passion, the dumb bully gave instructions to his team. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a moment, I thought he could had changed, but then I remembered the incident I recently had with him and Luke. And strangely, I also remembered my psychedelic induced hallucination. No. Not that. Not now. Nor *ever* .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"You know what I heard?\", continued Sarchie, with total revulsion for his past bully. \"That he also coaches the female soccer team. And that some students complained about *stuff* , but nothing ever happened. **No one believes them\u2026**\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHatred devoided me of anger. A couple of weeks ago, I would have laughed and called \"bullshit\" on the gossip. Right now, I believed it: I knew what Nick was capable of. He, Luke, the late Paul and of course, Jason, the ringleader. And less we forget, **me**. Watching Nick cheering his players with a big smile made my blood boil with a strange jealousy. And now, those rumors...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I couldn't be guided by violent emotions tonight. I had to keep a *fa\u00e7ade* of compliance and normality, even if I felt suffocated by life and by the omen of death. I looked away in anger and then I saw Amir leaving quickly. Where to? What was going on? Sarchie stood up too. Was the sight of our enemies too much for them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I need a smoke!\", said Sarchie playfully. I chuckled: seeing my friends made me feel better than I expected. The game was about to start, but I surely didn't care about it, nor my friends. They were there just for the sake of tradition, and I was there just to keep my mask of sanity and innocence on. I hated that mask. I was dying to show my true ***Self*** , to be judged by laws, society, or even by a god. But sadly I still wasn't ready to fall under my own judgment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I was exiting the gym, I saw Amir to the side of the stands: he was talking with the Sheriff, a strange look in both men's faces. Something was going on. I felt a little paranoid at first: was it because of me? Jason? I stood close to them, trying to catch a glimpse of their discussion, but the loudness of the celebration made it impossible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFive minutes passed by and then Amir and the Sheriff parted ways. My friend exited to the school hallways. He noticed my presence and made a sign to me, in order to follow him. The halls were dim lighted and empy. Everyone was inside the gym, except for a couple of security guards placed at the entrance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"What's going on?\", I whispered to my friend, who started to walk quickly. Something was wrong. *Really wrong* . Amir looked sideways and then, when the guards weren't looking, signaled me to follow him to the bathroom. Inside, we were alone, our words isolated from wrong ears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Ok. You told me everything about Camille's crime and more, so you got the right to now. But please, keep calm\", he whispered. \"Yeah, go on\", I said. Anxiety slowly taunted my stomach, but the meds were already having an effect on me. Yet the feeling of something dismal haunted me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"Remember Tatiana? My assistant? She's a counselor here. And she was worried one of the students would do something stupid tonight. Something** ***really*** **stupid\".**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI definitely needed life to slow down. Things were just getting worse by the minute. \"You mean guns?\", I asked bluntly. Shit. There was a lot of people here, young people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"That's what it seems. Tatiana wasn\u2019t really sure. But now I can't contact her. She's *missing*, and she didn\u2019t even alerted the police. I called the Sheriff as soon as I could. **At first I doubted, but now the kid's** ***missing*** **too.** They are bringing backup.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFunny. I didn't thought of an imminent killing spree, of blood and dead students during a celebration that was supposed to be about community and fraternal union. I just thought of the Australian incident related to The Siren Game, the one with *the girl that was ran over in the desert*. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSomehow, everything brought me back to that wicked game. But that girl, she was a victim of abuse, having unleashed her vengeance upon those who had wronged her. What about this kid, right here, right now? If Tatiana was right, what was driving him? Bullying? Abuse? Videogames? Satanic messages in backward heavy metal songs? I couldn't think straight, the irony of it all making me curse my (lack of) luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Alright. So what's the deal now? Should I leave? Isn\u2019t this a little bit too excessive?\", I asked nervously and confused.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We cannot risk it. Sarchie went out too, right? You go get him and then get the fuck out of here. The police is already acting: after securing the exits, they are going to stop the game\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe white light in the bathroom flickered, as if a ghostly presence had surrounded us. Amir was sweating: this was clearly an unexpected situation. Stopping the game was insane. What if Tatiana was wrong? Soon, the nerves inside my body started fighting the medication's calming effect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I know what you are thinking, but I can't leave. I can help. Ok? You go and be safe...\", answered my friend. I didn't understand why he had to be here while a possibly dangerous kid roamed the school with a lethal mission. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**No, false. I did understand why: it was his** ***job*** **. He wasn\u2019t a** ***coward*** **. I was.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I can't believe this. Everywhere I go, shit happens\", I said with a slow breath that felt like absolute submission to my fucked up destiny. We both laughed nervously. \"Be careful\", I begged my friend, and after that he left in a hurry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bathroom's mirror reflected my tired visage: I didn't look like a ghoul anymore, but I still had that pale expression of sadness and doom that made me look sick. **Guilt was eating me alive**, making me wish I was dead. But right now I needed to live, truth and justice being so close. I couldn't die here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter washing my face with cold water, I followed Amir's trail. There was no one in the hallways, the distant sound of music and cheering still reaching my ears. Somehow, they still hadn't stop the game. What if my friend was wrong? What if they just decided to continue? No, they couldn't risk the life of a soon-to-be senator, a prick with *privilege* .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFollowing my friend's advice, I slowly looked for an exit, yet something beautiful and depressive caught my attention: near the school's trophy case, there was a small altar. It was made from wood, decorated with pictures and hand-written messages. Some candles were lit, making the darkness shine with a red and weak light. It instantly made me think of **The Watcher's Tree**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**It was a small shrine for Camille**, her yearbook photo in the middle of it, every gift people had left for her shining amidst the crimson candles. When did they make this? Who? Her family, surely: her sister was much younger than us, and this was a beautiful *memento* . I felt warmth and love, but most importantly, sadness. Profound sadness...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYet it was as if the ethereal glow of that little sanctuary could ***clear*** **the guilt**, at least for a few seconds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike a phantom echo, the sound of music and screams that came from the celebration was distant and nostalgic. I couldn't think of anything else. I just reflected back on how many people were still in *pain*, mourning for Camille even after all the years. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that was my fault, of course. But somehow, now I felt the need to mourn: I too needed to embrace the ghost of Camille. As soon as I approached the photo, I felt completed drawn by its power of grief, and soon it came back:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"Press X to pay respects\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain. And again. What was happening? Maybe the meds weren't fully working yet. Or maybe they weren't enough in order to suppress my guilt-ridden visions. Yet I was again haunted by prompts that mocked me, making me doubt reality and tremble in the idea of being trapped inside a *fake* simulation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But I wasn't.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis time, I didn't follow my ritual of closed eyes, head movement and repetition: instead, I did exactly what the prompt moved me too. I took Camille's photo, held it in my hand and then kissed her while closing my eyes. I was to blame for this tragedy, no matter what judges, people or friends said. Or gods. It was all on me: I could have done something to avoid it, but **I didn't**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositioning the photo back in the altar made the prompt disappear. **What if I started to embrace it?** And I meant not only the guilt, but also the visions. What if I played along to what my corrupted and sick mind suggested? *The Siren* was caressing my brain, her maimed body now rearranging in a dark corner and coming back for me. I needed to face it all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmidst the loneliness of the hallways and during my melancholic meditation, the sound of an opening door surprised me completely. It came from my left, where the deceitful darkness led to an exit, a green sign shining bravely in the distance. The presence was wraith-like, quickly bringing me down from my journey into unpleasant memoires. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, who was this? That exit led to the schoolyard, where Camille's memorial took place days ago. I gazed upon the black mass of stillness, the noise of slow footsteps finally approaching me. Who was this? Police? Maybe Tatiana's disturbed young patient? Or maybe... Maybe something that wasn't... No. **No. Those things aren't real.** But then, what I saw coming from the shadows made me doubt my *skeptic* creed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStanding at the distance, a cloaked figure looked at me, a presence that was hard to describe. It was of mid-stature, the long mantle completely black, making it blend with the chasm behind its back. But the face... That was what made me tremble in fear; fear of having to face a judgment that was even more painful than those the doctor had mentioned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mask. A white mask. But not any mask: the** ***Siren Mask*** **.** Yes, I was sure of it. That was the pale mask the Siren wore in the game, before the struggle that made me remove it from her divine face. The eyes were the same holes that had gazed upon me with a depressive rage, two abysses made of pure and abstract darkness. **Hate. Sorrow. Death.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnswers choked me in agonic dread: so much to think, so little time. Who was this? And why the mask? Was it after me? We both stared at each other in silence, the light in almost complete absence. What should I do? Run? But before my decisions were destroyed by the gamble of adrenaline, a loud *bang* filled the air with reckless rush. **A gunshot**, very close to our location.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth the specter and I reacted in shock to the sharp release: there I knew for sure that what stood before me was somehow human. Ghosts aren't afraid. Ghosts are the ones who make us afraid. And that person was struck by nervousness, a feeling so heavy and so staggering. Startled, the hooded figure ran back into the exit that led to the schoolyard. I had to follow. I had to know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSilly me. Stupid me. Curiosity killed the cat, right? What was I going after? Running blind, I chased the shadows with a brutal and peculiar death wish: I wanted to know who was behind the mask. The shot didn't interested me: clearly, the boy's killing spree had started. But now I needed answers, and **that wasn't my problem.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhoa. \"That wasn't my problem\". So edgy. **So selfish.** What if they got Amir? Or Sarchie? What if innocent kids died? What if Jason's had a bullet to its head? Good. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood? No: my sick mind thought, for a second, that I wanted to be the one making he pay. But that didn't matter. **Wait, what did?** The kids? My friends? Should I go back? No, I was far too close to it...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRain. Dramatic, cold and stupid rain, the drops making everything slippery. When did it started to rain? Falling, getting up, and loosing balance: nothing mattered. I had to keep going. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cloaked person re-entered the school through another door, leading to a labyrinth of classrooms. Dammit! God fucking dammit! I lost it, the silence covering every chance of finding out who was lurking in the pitch-black maze.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSoon a window opened with rage: was it the storm? Should I investigate? My anxiety was strangely covered by rage. Who was doing this? Who wanted to torment me this hard? What was waiting for me inside the black vortex? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"You must seek, not hide\", said the Watcher. I couldn't** ***coward*** **anymore.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFollowing the wind, I finally got inside an empty classroom, the pale tempest illuminating it in purple and silver light. A trail of blood foretold the scene I found after reaching the broken window: at my feet, against the wall, laid Nick, his body stabbed, blood covering his clothes and spilling to the ground. How? He was in the court just minutes ago. Why? Who did this? Who was wearing the mask?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"POLICE! FREEZE!\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBehind me, some police officers led by Detective Loki aimed at me, flashlights illuminating the crime scene. I looked right at the detective, who was as surprised as me by the bloodbath.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"It wasn't me...\", I said to him, the sound of thunder giving an almost noir dramatic to the setting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\"I know...\"**, answered the detective, holstering his weapon and shaking his head in frustration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat started as a game of tears was now becoming a wild hunt.","71":" \n\nDear G. and E., \n\nRoads are just roads. New or old. Mega-Highways being born across the Mongolian Desert as a new oesophagus for the Chinese Migration of Goods. Planned, thought out, tended to and constructed to last the million year reign of a nation\u2019s commercial superiority.\n\nOr old, old paths laid singularly by the gravity of feet, pressed into the memory of the earth, weaving between the trees in the path of least resistance. Like water. Like neurones, spreading and connecting. Weaving together the borders of \u2018here\u2019 and \u2018there\u2019. \n\nPath of Least Resistance Blvd. High-street and low-street. \n\nThe biggest and longest river flows \u2018above\u2019 the amazon. A thick intestine of desert minerals and moisture that feeds the earth\u2019s biggest lung.  \n\nIn 1997 there was a man named Forrest Lunch who lived alone in Maine. Very well off since the murder of his parents when he was seventeen years of age in September of 1977. The family had been travelling on business through Texas towards Amarillo and had let the young man drive for the first time in his life, steering the Town-Car along the smooth roads between the brown foothills along the border that hide the miles of crouched black oil pumps and burning wells that warp the sky with their impossible heat. His parents sat in the back holding hands as their son chauffeured them the six miles to the Hotel.\n\nThe young Forrest noted up ahead a young man by the side of the road, sticking his thumb out for a lift, not looking much older than Forrest himself, smiling with his long brown hair blowing in the warm western wind. \n\nForrest was charitable despite the apprehensive noises his parents made, especially the clucking of his mother that sent his act from charitable, to possibly vindictive. He steered the car to the side of the road and asked \u201cWhere to?\u201d and the young man said simply to the next town would Forrest be so kind. And he sat in the passenger seat. \n\nThe car ran off the road after he pulled a pistol from his waistband and tried to hold them up for cash and trinkets. He was ejected the from the vehicle and fled into the desert while Forrest was left knocked unconscious, the big steel Lincoln crest emblazoned on the steering-wheel printed into his forehead after the impact with the thick disused telephone pole.\n\nHis parents were killed after Mr. Lunch reached into his waistband for his Gold Cup .45. The first shot practically decapitated Mrs. Lunch. The two to the lungs for her husband were the first half of a deadly trauma that would be finished off by a second impact after his head collided with the generous metal ash-tray that was custom in cars at the time which fractured his sphenoid bone into a blast of fragments, raking the soft and fragile depths of his brain into assured retardation and eventual death.\n\nLunch lived in deep in Maine, east of the Baxter State Park, secluded and extremely private the way Nuclear Launch sites are private, far from any road to avoid the firm neural pathway that had been scarred into his that day. \n\nHis completely all-consuming and debilitating fear of people by the side of the road. \n\nTherapies and treatments and Forrest Lunch -despite being a brilliant land-broker over the phone like his father- was amputated of easy transit. Blindfolds, sacks, driven backwards or sideways or unconscious, the simple thought of a figure by the side of the road would send Forrest into a panic that would take weeks to recover from. And so in his home he remained.\n\nUntil some detectives in Texas found a match for the blood they scrapped from the shards of windshield not more than twenty years ago. And found a match. \n\nForrest knew the face, but for a conviction, he would have to travel to the Lone Star State and see him in person. And flying was out of the question. \n\nHe would have to drive. \n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of lonely little roads in America. Backroads, side-roads, service roads, access roads. Roads that nobody uses. \n\nHe needed to convict his parents killer. He needed to be free of this fear. He would have to confront it eventually. But until then, Forrest developed a plan. \n\nHe pooled his assets and collected together the most accurate surveys of land he could have access to, sending his assistants out with their sophisticated camera equipment which they used to give him accurate pictures of the land he was caring for and arranging the sale of and charged them with their own small piece in the task of building him the most private highway in North America. Over the next three months, Lunch and his team developed an action plan to forge a smooth cut down from the eastern shoulder of Maine down into the sweating southern codpiece of Texas with as small of a chance of stragglers as possible. The loneliest road. A month-long journey into the recesses of the American topography. A painfully slow crawl through the forgotten nooks and crannies of bygone ghosts of transit dreams.\n\nHe purchased acres of land, had old tunnels reinforced, hand mountain roads cleared, kept logging crews on retainer to keep the former timber tracts free of fallen trees for his journey to have the least delay. \n\nAnd he arranged for the transfer of the suspect to the Les Mouches Texas Ranger outpost at the edge of Texarkana where he would meet him. Far from any road. \n\nIt took twenty-six days for Lunch to travel on his own, armed with a car-borne telephone and rations in a Ford Bronco to finally breach the outskirts of Texarkana where he climbed from his vehicles and met the Rangers at the Christopher Pass Civil War Battle Memorial Boulder within the embrace of Christopher Pass Canyon National Park. \n\nThere, Forrest Paulsen Lunch met a man the Rangers told him killed his parents. A man he might have had offered the kindness of a ride twenty years ago.\n\nHe did not recognise him. \n\nBut that did nothing to halt the man\u2019s conviction by the state of Texas for the double-murder and attempted robbery of Thomas Weyland Lunch and Anne-Marie (n\u00e9e Kloones) Silvia Lunch, with which he was afforded the honour of being welcomed among the last thirteen men to be executed by the method of the Electric Chair in the state of Texas in early October of 2001. He shared the same birthday at Lunch. \n\nOur roads and our paths are none but our own. And we have to make them no matter what. To breach river and foliage, to bridge the fissures of the earth or the body of its oceans. Our transit is assured and of upmost importance as natural apparatus in keeping our world alive.\n\nAs much as the footprints of others can comfort us in the fist of storm and loss, carved into sand or mud or fresh snow, only our own will be left behind. \n\nThey say that no man is an island. I say that no road leads to nowhere. \n\nThere are cut off places. Hidden places people might associate as necrotic. Forgotten parts of the world choked of transit like a hard thumb pressed on a plump vessel cuts the blood from the tissue. Places not abandoned. But begging to be found again.\n\nRebirth is underrated. And always possible. There is always a path. No matter to where. \n\nAmerica was and will be discovered a billion times over, before and after the Spaniards braved the surf of their New English Coast. By the blood-sucking midges carried on the Northern Drafts, by the tired gulls that trawled the sea for food long before the offal of fishermen became abundant. By the kind and doting dolphins of the Western Surf carried into the Gulf by the sub-nautical highways that fertilise the reefs in coastal bosoms and the swirling gyres far from land. By the light that travels so far from the irises of young and ancient stars, tired from its journey to the point the waves almost lap and wane as they light up the atmosphere on their arrival and meet the eyes of those who happen to be watching. And by the staccato of comets and meteors brushing off the hard atmosphere of our domed world. Discovered and re-discovered against odds so small the raw number would be vapour. \n\nNo road leads to nowhere. \n\nThe lightning that has existed since the beginning of time that passed through the living body of a man to burn him alive from the inside out was travelling along its natural path to return into the earth.\n\nOur roads met briefly. I send you all the best from the road I travel. And wish you a safe and pleasant journey on your own. To wherever they may lead. \n\nThank you for everything. And most of all, for the road-side assistance when I needed it most.\n\nLove, \n\nJ.","72":"Beaten and sorrow tears filled the brim of thy eyes once again. Yet another disappointment to the two lingering shadows that chided words that are just numb screech at this point. \n\nIn a world where one family is living amongst the hierarchy of the better-off, being poor is a sin, where every single copper and dime have to be saved and utilized appropriately. Gifts to the princes and princesses all around, yet only screams and quarrels of the two lingering shadows all time past, much less having a pint of dust. But that is fine, for peace is the present one needs in terms of turmoil. \n\nSmelling the aroma of sweet curry, salty soups, cheers every evening, yet alone in the dark cold room where there is little space to commune. Not that there is any single being other than thee. Having a piece of bread or a bowl of rice is a sensation like never before. \n\nTormented by disgust of others for books being borrowed, pens being scraped, and being thy one that seeks peace and not the drama of cliques, riches, and ideal thoughts of status and ambition. One just wish to stay alone and have peace to eventual seeking of thy calling. \n\nDying slowly, peace by peace. Lack of dreams due to the environment and limitations, even when one finally got the nidbits to purchase something. Be it a console or a wish to learn music or art, dreams torn to ashes when the lingering shadows throw not only the puny attempts of the keenness to learn something potentially out of reach, or the pleasure to enjoy something, thy books, torn clothes and everything spice and nice one may have got thrown away too. \n\nGuess that is the lesson of defiance. Eventually, there is no place to go but to crawl back into the hole of comfort. Shelter is the most essential. But what's most important is to find who I am. At this point, I only seek to find myself... But I found something else. At first, one would have thought that it's an imaginary friend, something I wish I could have since pets are impossible due to lack of the funds, thus responsibility and liability to take care, plus having medical conditions of touching fur is a straight no-go. \n\nPerhaps, I seek a friend too hard. But that was not the case. My sister could also see it. Perhaps, it was only the children who can see it, but that was definitely not the case as well. We call it the smiling picture. It was one of the lingering shadow's wedding image, which was probably the best and holiest time it could be when one found true happiness at first glance. Mayhap the reality of being poor is not to be, until your responsibilities start kicking in, destroying the fence of pureness and any form of joy depreciates and piles down to nothingness.\n\nWhen in tears, one always seek comfort of the image. One may think there is a spirit or a guardian that was in the picture. Comforting thee when being sad, sucking out the forms of torment and disappointment of the day. Although there is silence, or no forms jumping out of the image, the image changes the emotions from the usual smile to an even larger grin or tears, or at times a u-shape downwards. Most of the time, it leans towards the larger grin. \n\nNo one to talk to, the image may have taken my memories, my emotions to replace any form of sorrow. As a result, only numbness and emptiness await. Even when other lingering shadows from near or far go to a greater place, and everyone tear-jerks around, one is standing still emotionless although not ignorant. Emotions just stop within time. Could one have snapped and turn cold?\n\nDue to being a loner, I was able to make friends who are either also loners or people with special conditions, be it physical or mental, likely due to my weak body and mental state. Talentless one may be, random ideas and thoughts float whenever there is a literature lesson. A young me managed to grow close to another. He was smart and talented unlike the rotten thee. Yet, we managed to have fun, protect eachother from bullies, perhaps true writing stuff that intrigues others in the literature sessions. Although one is not good with language, pure ideas just filled thy mind. Perhaps, that's why I could make it in that session where all others lessons just appear dull or that one feels dumb trying to catch anything. \n\nAt first, suspecting the image had sucked not only emotions and memories, but my ability to remember things, since no matter how hard I try, I forget.. Just like I wish I forget everything in life. Perhaps that is all for the best after all..\n\nMonths after graduating and moving on to the next path of study which I found tough, due to my lack of remembering things, I lost contact with the similar shadow, someone I called friend. I didnt thought much of it, but the image showed me. Tears and eyes closing and shaking its head, I felt something was amiss. Searching the net while in the library, then I only knew the other shadow has moved on. Perhaps it was a better release than to meet the dubious expectations and bullies. Pain undo from the pills tiny yet powerful. \n\nOnce again, I stare at the image. No tears, no emotions. \n\nThrough hours of labour, and saving for yet another attempt in an effort to taste the efforts with a console and also an instrument. Before taking a leap of faith, one felt a sense of emptiness. I couldn't have the capacity to remember or have fun being alone, being forgetful. Instead, one just donated the money away. Perhaps being free of everything is key of enlightenment.\n\nOnce again, the image comfort me with smiles when it knew I was lonely.\n\nEven when one's family moved, where at this point of time, the elder sister had earned alot doing sales jobs. The picture remained and continue to stay with us. Although there were colours from my iris, and I can see the sunlight and moonshine, a part of thee still felt empty. \n\nAt times, I work overnight and stressed myself out. Hallucinations start kicking in, literal shadows floating about, yet they disappear when I'm near the image, empowering me to keep catching deadlines.\n\nApparently the image is not harmless and might be helpful at times. Bringing this out to other shadows that I thought I may be comfortable with, the image will either smile and nod or the worst case scenario, growl with fierce resistance. Well.. The one that got growled literally betrayed my trust and stole something important from thee, which isn't the important thing here.\n\nThe image was able to determine the people I hang out with. Perhaps I just prefer to be kept in the dark or just face life as it is. I stopped brining anyone to the humble little home. Not that anyone will be happy to do so, since compared to their lush apartment, they will rather hang outside. But those shadows are not bad people. It's just life as it is, the status and the way they were brought up.\n\nDespite being penniless most of the time, I found joy doing acts of kindness and everytime at home, the image will nod and smile too. \n\nWhen my second sister eventually married out, she could no longer feel any connection with the image. She revealed a secret or so to me at that point. When she was younger, she almost wanted to jump the fence. It was the image who encouraged her to push on. \n\nAn older me to this point is still looking at the image, even chatting to it at times. I'm still looking for myself. I'm also wondering what will happen eventually if I ever manage to find a loved one. But I knew all my emotions, thoughts and memories have been touched by it and nothing will ever be the same. Perhaps only writing gibberish thoughts and ideas, or my memories will reawaken something eventually. \n\nThe image had never felt cold nor scary. It never speaks, just morphs with emotions. Even as one grows older, it still remains.\n\nPerhaps the image who brought me the small colors of life, had took away things from me to protect or as a payment. Who knows?","73":"He says that he visits abandoned asylums, prisons, hospitals and so on, and showcases them for others to see. I heard a voice saying.\n\nI opened my eyes and squinted, I appeard to be lying in some sort of hospital room. What the hell had happened? Why was I here? I couldn\u00b4t see anyone else around that the voice i just heard could belong to, then again, I couldnt see much of anything. My head hurt and my vision was blurry. I closed my eyes again and went over the last couple of days in my head, trying to figure out what was going on.\n\nFirst of, I\u00b4m Jason.\nI manage a pretty successful YouTube channel, where I, mostly alone, go out and investigate abandoned places. Urban exploring, I love it man! I love finding a place that no one else has discovered yet, to roam the halls of old school buildings, check out old prison cells or hospital rooms, the occasional presumably haunted cabin in the woods. I shoot video while doing this and post it on YouTube. I have quite the large fan base too, I\u00b4m proud to say. In fact, I\u00b4ve been able to make a living doing this for the last two years now. \nI\u00b4m always respectful to the places I visit, I never take anything with me home, no matter what. And let me tell you, I\u00b4ve found some pretty cool stuff over time. I also always research the places I\u00b4m going to very well, so that I can give it a fair representation in the videos.\n\n\nThis last place I found; man was it awesome. Located in the middle of nowhere, it the midst of a huge forest, its tall towers with what in its glory days would have been gleaming spires peaked high above the treetops, now forsaken and on the verge of collapsing in on themselves. Since long bereft of their former majestic stature. This place was huge. Built in the classic gothic style of the 19th century, it\u00b4s now blackened stone surface looked like something out of a classic knights tale.\n\n\n\u201cThe Fairmeadow Asylum for the clinically insane\u201d the huge curved iron sign said above the gate, leading into the premises. I had found this place while researching on different forums online, some people had talked about it, but I couldn\u00b4t find anyone who had acually went there. Presumably because it was quite a hassle to get to. This was nowhere near where I lived, but after reading up on it, and looking at the photos, mind you, there weren\u00b4t many of them to be found, I just knew I had to go. There wasn\u00b4t much information to find about the place, I did however manage to find one old article from a local newspaper stating that at some point in the early 1900s, a patient, who the paper didn\u00b4t mention by name, almost managed to burn the whole place down, and in the midst of the confusion and disarray of the fire, acually managed to escape the Asylum, never to be found again.\n\n\nI had decided to make it a road trip, I was going to start here, at The Fairmeadow Asylum, and move on from there to an old prison, an abandoned train yard, and wrap it up with an old orphanage that had been turned into a military hospital during world war II. This would give me material enought for a couple of weeks of videos.\n\n\nIt took me several hours and more than one wrong turn to finally roll up to the impressive gate. \nThe gate, since long overtaken by nature, ivy grasping hold of the iron bars climbing from the ground all the way up over the cursive letters spelling out the name stood silently looming over the forgotten entrance.. Dead bushes and shrubberies growing wild all around the high fence surrounding the huge plot of land that belonged to the Asylum. A gravel road led down the centre of the front yard, on both sides decorated with what looked like apple trees. There were no apples now though, only bare branches reaching out like long bony fingers, looking to grab you if you came to close. The once, I assume, beautiful front yard was now heavily overgrown, it had been many years since this place last saw maintenance.\n\n\nI slowly drove down the narrow road, that ended in a roundabout in front of the main entrance. The roundabout cirkled around an old cracked and partially ruined cast stone fountain. The once white stone figures in the middle, children-like angels that at one point presumably were pouring water out of their pots, now only filled with dirt, was missing both wings and other parts. Covered in dark green moss and dead leaves they gave the place a real ominous feel, Their blank stare, frozen in time, destined to look over the slow decay of this place until they themselves would be overtaken by nature and neglect.\nI parked my car and got my camera bags out of the trunk. I started filming outside by the fountain, doing my intro and going over some of the history of the place: \n\n\n- The Fairmeadow Asylum for the clinically insane, I started, opened in 1864 and was at its peak the home to over 600 patients that were put here for a variety of reasons. Back then it didn\u00b4t take much to be deamed insane . It could be as little as being a bit paranoid, slow in learning, reading, writing, or what we today diagnose as ADD or ADHD. There were of course also the cases here that were clearly more accurately described as truly insane. The patients hearing voices, speaking in tongues, people with schizophrenia and split personalities, the once having sudden fits of pure wild aggression against whomever was unfortunate enough to being closest to them at that moment. Though no matter what the reason for the diagnosed insanity , this place had a sure way of making sure you\u00b4d be calm and not acting up ever again \u2013 The Lobotomy.\nWe will get back to that as we make our way to the operating rooms where these horrific procedures took place, I said while moving closer to the entrance.\n\n\nAs I was walking up the stone stairs leading to the huge front door, going on with my presentation, I got a sudden feeling of Deja vu, only way stronger than I had ever had before. It felt like I had been there before, which of course I hadn\u00b4t. It wore of, like Deja vu\u00b4s usually do, and I didn\u00b4t think any more of it, until later.\nThe doors were made of massive wooden planks, several inches thick, with a small square in the middle with metal bars forming an intricate pattern of a flower in the middle, with leaves and branches reaching out to the outer frame. I pulled on the cast iron handles and watched as the doors slowly slid open, pushing broken branches and piles of dead leafs down the front stairs to the sound of the rusty hinges screaming and screeching like a wounded animal in a bear trap. The sound travelled into the rooms and hallways on the other side of the doors, echoing as it went, making it sound more like a thousand damned souls slowly burning in the fiery pits of hell.\n- What a nice welcome! I commented on the video with a smile.\n\n\nA big entrance area opened up once inside the doors, a very high ceiling towering above, curved like the inside of a church, with lots of decorative details making its way to the very centre where a huge chandelier still hung, motionless and covered in cobwebs. The floor was black and white checkered stones, cracked at places and with a fair amount of dust that for the first time in forever got to dance around in the wind again when I opened the door. To my left was what I assumed the front desk, where nurses or orderlies would welcome both visitors and new patients. \n\n\nTo my right, on the wall hung a huge floor plan over the Asylum, with directions to all the different facilitys.\nThere was a birds eye view drawing of the place, it was built like a huge letter \u201dT\u201d with the main entrance I had just come through located in the cross section where the horizontal line met the vertical. The top line, or horizontal if you like, was the front of the Asylum which I had seen towering in front of me while driving down the gravel road, I\u00b4ll refer to this as the \u201dmain building\u201d. The vertical line now lay infront of me, straight in from the entrance, I\u00b4ll refer to this as the \u201dsecondary building\u201d. \n\n\nTo my right and left huge hallways went down the east and west wing forming the horizontal line of the \u201dT\u201d. According to the map, there were four floors including the ground floor, and a basement right beneath where I was standing now. Behind the whole complex, out on the back behind the secondary buildning there was a small house, a crematorium, and a cemetary with mostly unmarked graves where they had buried the patients that had died here who had no one to claim their bodys or remains.\n\n\nOn the ground floor, or first floor if you\u00b4d like, of the main building, in the west wing, there were mostly offices and smaller examination rooms, I assume to be close at hand when checking in new patients. To my right, on the ground floor of the east wing, there was a big dining room with an adjacent kitchen, a recreation room, a library and some more smaller offices.\nStraight ahead of me on the first floor of the secodary builing were rooms that the staff could stay in overnight. Being as it was, way out in nowhere, staff probably worked a number of days in a row on a rotating schedule before being replaced by their colleagues. So of course they all needed somewere to stay the night while working.\n\n\nIn the entrance area, the center of the cross section where the two buildings met, there were two huge staircases going up on either side of the door leading in to the secondary building. This house was built before the invention of elevators, but it seemed that they had done some remodeling back in the early 1900s and fit one in next to the east side staircase. They sure did everything in style back then, now faded of course it looked like it had been a very nice looking elevator back in its prime. With brass doors and a golden frame around it. And a big finely carved golden arrow pointing to the floor numbers above. \n\n\nThe curved marble stairs were at least 10 feet wide going up in a semi cirkle from floor to floor. The handrails of the staircases too, were an impressive feat of woodworking. The dark smooth wood twisting around in a beutifuly detailed braid all the way from the top floor to the first, ending at two big pillars, they too covered in fine details on the sides, and on top two big hand carved wooden owls, with their wings to their sides and big eyes gazing out in to the lobby, towards the big front doors. Probably representing wisdom and in some pshycological way maybe there to sooth newcomers and family members that this was a place of learning, information and healing, and not just a place where you would drop of family members that you just didn\u00b4t have the strength to deal with anymore, which of course it was for a huge part. \n\n\nOn all walls of the lobby hung big oil paintings of what I assume were the head doctors of this place. They were, like everything else in here, covered in dust and cobwebs, some hung slighty crooked and one had even fallen to the ground, breaking the massive frame in two. \u201dDr. John L. Thomas\u201d, it said in golden letters on the bottom of the cracked frame. The painting, showing an elderly gentleman with white hair and a impressive beard, grasping a big round pipe staring straight ahead with a pierce that almost made it seem that he was looking straight through you, now lay on the floor. What a shame, I thought.\n\n\nI turned back to the floor plan on the wall to my right. \nOn the west wings second floor of the main building they had patients rooms 1-80, and on the east wing rooms 81-161. The second floor of the secondary building were classrooms and smaller meeting rooms. Third floor of the main building held patient rooms 162-242 on the west side and 243-323 on the east side, and in the secondary buildning they had recovery rooms on one side of the hallway, where patients would rest after surgeries, and isolation cells on the other, if they needed to be kept separete from other patients for whatever reason. Forth floor main building had patient rooms 324-404 in the west wing and 405-485 in the east wing. Some of the patient rooms were double rooms and sometimes, even if they were singles, they would put more then one patient in the rooms to be able to fit them all. In the secondary building, the forth floor had the operating rooms, this is where they performed the lobotomys of the patients the doctors decided were in need of it. The floor plan showed the basement as \u201dstorage\u201d and \u201darchive\u201d.\n\n\nI decided I would start by checking out the first floor and move my way up, and with camera in hand I went down the hallway to my right, heading towards the rec room and dining area. It struck me how it seemed that the people here had just up and vanished one day, everything was left in place just like it had been evacuated in a hurry. There were food trays and an old hospital bed left in the hallway, a bit further down I saw and old wheelchair laying on its side on the floor. The paint on the walls was mostly gone, curled up and cracked, showing the brickwork behind it. Here and there you could still see the remnants of the old paint though, it seemed like the bottom half of the walls had been painted green, and the top half white. This was not just an aesthetic choice, everything in places like this was psycological in some way. Green has always been thought of as a restful and quiet color, while white symbolizes clarity and freshness. Subtle ways to unconsciously keep patients in a tranquil state. \n\n\nI soon came up to the entrance to the rec room, two big white double doors stood open welcoming me in to the big room. As in the reception and hallway it was a high ceiling with stucco work all around, the same colors as in the hallway could be hinted on the decaying walls. Huge bookshelfs covered the entire wall to my right, and on the south wall, looking over the front yard and gravel road I had come down before ,were enormous windows, letting in a lot of light. Natural light had always been thought of as healing, so naturaly they wanted their patients to get as much as possible, though, the grid of metal bars in front of the windows did remove quite a bit of the feeling of freedom. \nTables and chairs were scattered across the room, board games and books lay here and there. I took some shots of the books on the shelfs and the room at large before I ventured out into the hallway again, moving down towards the library. \n\n\nWhen entering the library you could clearly see that this was built not for the patients but for the staff. Mainly because of the colors of the room, everything was in a darker hue, and all the furniture was made out of dark wood, massive sturdy bookshelfs all along every wall, leaving only free space for the windows to let some light in. Round smaller coffee tables were positioned around the room with big leather armchairs set in cirkles around them. It looked like a classic brandy and cigarr-room if you know what I mean. \nThe books on the shelves were mostly old medical books, encyclopedias and so on.\nAfter getting some cool shots of the place I kept going. The dining area was like any other, long rows of tables, walls once all white, now like the rest of this place, cracked and foresaken, with the same sized barred windows as in the rec room. On the far east side you would get your tray and your food and behind the counter you could see in to the old kitchen. That was about it for the first floor on the east side. \n\n\nI went back to the lobby, and past it, going down the west side to check out some of the offices and smaller examination rooms. This was cool! All the equipment was left behind. You had the classic medical cabinets with glass windows on the upper half, some cracked but mostly in fine condition except for the wood expanding and paint peeling off. Old syringes and bottles of God knows what still stood there. Metal beds nailed to the floor in the center of the rooms, with leather straps attached to the sides to be able to strap down patients who wouldn\u00b4t be still. I won\u00b4t lie, it was a creepy place to be in all by yourself. It wouldn\u00b4t take much to convince yourself that the place was haunted, no matter if you believe in that stuff or not. And this was just the first floor! With daylight still coming through the windows!  But you couldn\u00b4t help almost hearing the screams and feeling the anguish of the people that had been left here, especially those that probably didn\u00b4t need this kind of \u201dhelp\u201d. \n\n\nImagine, being dropped of at a place like this by your family, being strapped to a table and getting shot with a syringe full of sedatives just becuase you wasn\u00b4t like everyone else. Knowing you\u00b4d probably never see your siblings or parents again, knowing this would be your life until the day you finaly died and would be set free. The horrors that these walls had witnessed over the years, you really could feel it in the air.This house had not forgotten. \nMost of the examination rooms were alike, the offices across the hall were your basic doctors offices with big desks, some armchairs and bookshelfs, nothing out of the ordinary, really. I decided to check out the patient rooms on the second floor instead, and went back to the lobby and started to walk up the stairs to the west wing. Suddenly, another deja vu hit me! Or, not really a deja vu? \n\n\nI swear that for a split second it was as if I was surrounded by people. Doctors going up and down the stairs, voices coming from the rooms, it was as if I stepped back in time to when the Asylum was in full use. But with the blink of an eye it was all gone again, and the staircase once again echoed empty and was back in full deterioration. There was no other sounds to be heard except for my own slightly excited breathing. I stopped filming and looked back on the last minute of film I had shot, but there was nothing out of the ordinary, except for a couple of seconds that looked like I had some digital interference. Weird, I thought, before I resumed filming and went up to the second floor. \n\n\nThe hallway was in better shape up here than on the forst floor, and you could more clearly see the color scheme used, the same one as on the first floor with the now faded green on the bottom half and white above. I choose a room at random and went inside. It was a single room, and very sparsely furnished. Alongside the wall to my right was a bed, this too had the restriants firmly bolted to the side of the beds metal frame. A yellowish blanket still laid there. On the far side of the room, a narrow window was overlooking the front yard, this too with the metal bars in front of it, and two thin white see thru curtains hung from a curtain holder above. There was a small desk and a dresser with a couple of drawers. I moved on and found a room that still had an old patient robe hanging over a chair, with the name, \u201dFairmeadow Asylum\u201d printed in big faded letters on the back. I spent some time getting a few shots before I decided to go check out what I thought would be the crown jewel of my day here, the operating rooms on the fourth floor. \n\n\nJust as I was about to exit out into the hallway I noticed that the battery on my camera almost was completely drained, which was odd since I hadn't been filming for that long. I knew I had double checked that the batteries were fully charged before I left for my long drive here. Usually these batteries could keep going for at least 5 or 6 hours before starting to drain.\n\n\n- \u201dIs he still holding on to that character?\u201d \n\n\nThe words flew by me as a whisper in the wind. Did I just hear that, or think it? It sounded like it came from down the hallway, but I couldn\u00b4t be sure...I looked all around me and out down the hallway, nothing, no one. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, shaking the unsettling feeling off of me, changed the batteries in my camera and moved on.\nI couldn\u00b4t entirely shake the eeire feeling while walking back towards the stairs though. I don\u00b4t believe in ghosts, hauntings and stuff like that, but I had to admit, even I was starting to feel uncomfortable here. I had to double check to see that I really was alone here. \nHello?! I screamed down the empty hallway, my echo being the only respons. I quietly moved over to the room closest to me to see that there were no one lurking in there.\n\n\nA curtain hang from the ceiling, the kind you use to separate beds in a double room. I clearly saw the silouette of a person on the other side. Fear grabbed me! had I not been here by myself this whole time? was i being followed by some murderous lunatic, or worse?\nI slowly and quietly walked up to the curtain and with a swift move pulled it to its side! I grabbed hold of the bed in front of me and sighed in relief when I realized it was only a mannequin. The kind used to practice medical procedures on. It looked old and ragged, with multiple small holes all around the eyes, as if it had been stabbed over and over. I regained my nerves and started to walk back out to the stairs. The nagging feeling still lingered in the back of my head though, where did all the voices come from?\n\n\nI got up to the fourth floor, and this was by far the one most affected by time and neglect of them all. It looked like it had been deteriorating for much longer than the other floors. There was no paint left at all on the walls, just bare, cracked bricks, the ceiling was miscolored, dark, and sunken in at places. Looking as if it was about to completely cave in at any second. I hesitated. What if the floor would give way? I\u00b4d fall, I could get really hurt out here, with no help around, or worse. But what kind of urban explorer would I be if I didn\u00b4t  even attempt it? This was, after all, what I had come here for! I mustered my courage and took a first light step out onto the floor. There were no stone plates here, the floor was all wood, moldy wood by the smell of it. Some looked burnt. It creaked and cracked under my weight, but I kept on going. I went into the hallway of the secondary house. Here you could see clear traces of a fire at some point,. The walls had patches of darkness on them, as if they had been exposed to intense heat. This must have been the fire I read about, I thought.\n\n\n- \u201dJeremiah Robertson.\u201d\n\n\nI turned my head so fast I almost fell over, I swear it was as if someone had stood right next to me and whispered in my ear! But jusst like before, there was no one!\nI suddenly realized I was still laying strapped to this god damn bed. What the hell is going on! I yelled out. No respons. I tried looking around to see where I was, but quickly realized even my head had been fixated. I couldn\u00b4t move at all. Out of the corner of my eye I could see what looked like one of the medical cabinets I had seen in the examination rooms earlier, only.. it looked brand new. Not at all like the ones I had seen, with the paint peeling off or the cracked glass planes. Hello?? I yelled again. Is anybody there? What are you doing to me? Where am I? \nNothing..  God damnit, I thought, I need to remember how I got here.\nWhere was I ?.. Right, the fourth floor. I closed my eyes and kept going over what had happened out there on the Asylum.\nI had made my way in to the long hallway, above the door to my right there was a sign that was still readable, if only barely. OPR 2, it said. Operation Room 2, I guessed as I pushed the doors open. \n\n\n\nIt seemed to be one of those old educational operating rooms, where you had the operating table in the center of the room, and bleachers around it on a second level for medical students or colleagues to observe the procedure. It was an uneasy feeling being there, knowing what had happened to so many people here. So many lobotomys. The state of the room was mostly a lot better than the hallway on the other side of the door, though still looing very much abandoned. The entrance and the area just by the door did however looked badly scorched.. The floor was covered in big white tiles, mostly still intact, the operating table had rust eating away at the metal and the blackboard behind the table was more light-grey than black. Big windows looking east reminded me that the daylight was quickly disappearing. I took another glance att the blackboard and saw that you still could make out the writings and drawings that once had been there. \n\n\nFrom what I could gather it looked like it had been a detailed description of a lobotomy. When performing a lobotomy the patient was first rendered unconscious by electroshock. Allthough, rumors has it that this step wasn\u00b4t necessarily always done, sometimes all it took was a good old head-fixation and a quite concious patient. The doctor then placed a sharp ice pick-like instrument above the patients eyeball. With a swift and hard hammer stroke, the doctor then struck the \u201dice pick\u201d through the eye socket just above the eye, through the skull and into the brain, severing connections in the brain's prefrontal cortex which more often than not left the patient in a vegetative state for the rest of his or her life. This procedure was performed on all kinds of patients, most of whom could easily have had somewhat of a normal life if given the option.\n\n\nI contiuned to look around the room, and to my dismay I found the ice pick-looking instrument and the metal hammer lying on a small table beside the operating table. I picked it up and imagined how it would feel to see that thing, and to know that it soon would be lodged in you brain. I felt nauseous just holding it, and put it back down. I kept looking around and went through the drawers of a desk that stood in the corner. One drawer was full of metal bracelets with names stamped to a small plate in the middle. These must have belonged to the patients, I thought. There was about twenty of them, i picked one up; Janet McFerren, it said,  I looked at another; John Reese, Oliver Holden, the third said. I was about to close the drawer when one bracelet called out for my attention;  Jeremiah Robertson. There\u00b4s that name again, I thought. I swear I heard that before in the hallway. That would be one hell of a coincident, I thought, if I had just imagined a random name before, and then found this up here. Did I acually hear it ? Then again, what kind of explanation do I have for hearing names echoing down an abandoned asylum hallway? Am I losing it?\n\n\nI decided that I had more than enough footage of this floor and all of the surroundings. I thought it was best I started to pack up and head out, before it got completely dark outside. I had booked a room at a motel near the interstate not to far from the Asylum, where I would spend the night before heading out to the abandoned prison a couple of hours away the next day. I went back out to the staircase and went down into the reception area. As I stood there, packing my gear up I cast a final glance up on the floor plan again.\nThe Basement. I hadn\u00b4t checked out the basement. I looked outside, I still had mabye an hour before the sun would set. I knew I would beat myself up later if I didn\u00b4t check it out, after all, I had come all this way. Would be silly not to check the whole place out, right?\n\n\nSo I got my camera back up from the bag and started to film again as I went around the nurses desk in the reception. The room behind the desk was a lot bigger than I would have thought. It looked like some sort of break room for the nurses and orderlies, some tables and chairs, a sink and a small wood burning stove for smaller meals or heating water maybe. In the back there was a door. Even though the letters themselfs were gone, the way the sunlight had faded the color of the door you could still make out the letters that once had been there; \u201dBasement\u201d, it said.\nI remembered that the floor plan had said that the only things being kept down there were a storage and the archives, but I thought it might have some cool artifacts down there, so down I went.\n\n\nThe door was heavy, all metal, probably in case of a fire, I thought. Basements make good shelter and a metal door would keep a fire out. Behind the door, a narrow twisting stone staircase descended into the utter darkness. I picked up a flashlight from my backpack and lit the steps in front of me as I causiously took one step at a time, all the while narrating the video and explaining what I was doing.\n\n\n- \u201dRoom 272, it\u00b4s time!\u201d\n\n\nI almost fell down the stairs! It was the same voice as before, echoing from somwhere near, but just like before there was no one there. I was seriously contemplating my own sanity by now, but kept on going. I just needed to check out this last couple of rooms then I was out of here.\nI finaly came down to the basement after I dont know how many turns around that windling stair, and shone the beam of light eminating from the flashlight ahead of me. It was a large room with a low stone ceiling.\nThe walls and floor were also made out of big blocks of massive stone. There were small windows to my right, almost as high up as the ceiling, no bigger than twelve by six inches, but even these windows had bars on them, even though no one would ever fit through those narrow holes. I noticed that the daylight was disappearing faster than I had thought and was all but gone already, I better hurry, I thought.\n\n\nThe room was filled with cabinets and bookshelfs. Folders and books where stacked all around in what looked to be no order at all. I moved closer and soon found a cabinet with lots of small drawers, kind of like the once they used to have in librarys before everything got digitized. They were marked in alphabetical order, first drawer was A to C, second was D to F, and so on.\nI don\u00b4t know why, but my hand immediately moved to the drawer marked \u201dP to R\u201d. I set up the camera on the tripod I had been holding it with beside me, and pulled out the drawer. I squeezed the flashlight between my head and sholder and started to flip through the files inside. Petersen, Petrov, Perskins, Quinn, Quimby, Reed, Reynolds, Robertson,Robinson, Wait! Robertson! I pulled out the file and brought it, along with the camera, with me over to a table near the stairs. I opened it up and started to read;\n\n\nPatient nr: 367\nName: Jeremiah Robertson. \nAdmission date: April 4th, 1912. \nReason for admission: Schizophrenia \/ Multiple Personality Disorder  \nTreatment: Psychotherapy, counseling and psychosocial therapy.\nRoom: 272\nComments:\nPatient has been showing no siginificant sign of improvement over the last two years of continuous therapy.\nEven though the episodes of transition between the different personalities at times has been increased, the severety of them when they do happen have without a doubt grown worse. We have therefor decided, that patient nr 367, Jeremiah Robertson, is a prime candidate for undergoing a lobotomy. We strongly feel that this is what it will take to cure him from this monstrous disease. \nPatient has been scheduled for a Lobotomy on Nov 14th, 1914.\nSigned, Dr. John L. Thomas\n\n\nI felt ill, I couldnt explain why, I just did. I felt scared, and out of breath, like I had been running from something. When I turned to the next page of the file all the blood left my head and came crashing down in my feet. All the hairs on my body stood up and I fell to the ground. There, on the backside of the first page, barely still attached with some old glue was a picture of Jeremiah Robertson. A picture of me!\nI had dropped the file on the floor from the shock, I must have been mistaken, it\u00b4s dark down here! It couldn\u00b4t be! I grabbed the file and camera and ran upstairs to the break room.\n\n[Part II](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qrft3j\/patient_367_urban_exploring_at_an_abandoned\/)","74":" \n\nTRANSCRIBED: 11\/10\/2021\n\nTRANSCRIBER: Maker Bachvarov\n\nITEM 10 OF UNKNOWN\n\nITEM TITLE: Finnick and Titus #2\n\n[Table of Contents](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Bestzugen\/comments\/q6uicq\/records_of_bridgerton_reformatory_table_of\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[Part 9](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qqcmf5\/records_of_bridgerton_reformatory_part_9\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nWorking under the Headmistress has been far more tolerable than I could have hoped. She is curt, of course, but being as I\u2019ve found myself on her good side she is rather kind to me. I am writing this now from the private sleeping quarters she assigned to me. They are quite beautiful.\n\nThe mail runner has requested that we refer to them by the title of Moss. I informed them that we would, and while I have no doubt that you would do so without question, I must voice my request regardless. Or write it, in this instance.\n\nI have given a great amount of consideration to your request that I keep a close eye on Moss, and while I myself have one or two reservations, I must agree that you are correct; the Headmistress is far more likely to leave them be if she believes that it will sour me to her. I do fear, however, that our fellow classmates-turned-prisoners will begin to show hostility towards them, as they have already turned away from me. We are in the end times, and it would be foolish not to admit that the students here are teetering on the edge of violent rebellion.\n\nIt was not long after I began working under the Headmistress that I realized how impossible it would be to do anything under her nose. If we are to collect empirical evidence of the atrocities committed in this school we will have to devise a way to trick them into gathering it themselves, or at the very least allowing us to do it for them. In any case, they will be fully aware of what it is that we do. In order to write this letter I had to convince her that I was writing a journal of my experiences. She took to that concept very well, even going so far as to tell me that she herself writes in a journal as well. I believe this shared activity was what allowed me to create an emotional bond with her so quickly.\n\nI do apologize for the lot you were cast. Were it not for your record of causing problems for the institution, I would gladly have placed you with the Headmistress, but as it stands this was our only option. I do thank you for your willingness to assist me, and I hope to remove you from the kitchen as quickly as possible. Rest assured that my every moment will be spent devising a plan to bring you out.\n\nEND TRANSCRIPTION\n\nTRANSCRIBER NOTES: After the day\u2019s events, I got home and went directly into a deep, dreamless sleep. It was the kind that somehow leaves you feeling far more tired than you were when you went to sleep in the first place. I was still wearing the clothes I went to work wearing. The plus side is that I was so frazzled that I didn't cut off my hand. I know it sounds strange, but I had every intention of doing so the moment I got home. I guess that woman saved me from more than one thing yesterday.\n\nShe wasn't *on my side,* I don't think. Sure, she was protecting me, but it felt more like the \u201cbring the prisoner alive\u201d type of protection than truly wanting to keep me safe. And how far is too far? Could I commit some egregious offence that would put me on the wrong side of her fury? I was so terrified of her that even eating breakfast was a chore, and keeping it down was yet another. \n\nShe was back, that woman, demon, thing that had walked me home, she was waiting for me at the gate of my apartment building when I walked outside. It was a beautiful morning. The air was crisp and the sun fell through the gently turning leaves like a kaleidoscope. Seeing her in that beauty felt wrong, like seeing a rotting corpse in the middle of a child\u2019s nursery. She was the old woman again, and when she smiled it almost felt genuine.\n\n\u201cUm, hello. I wasn't expecting you back.\u201d I said. The hair on the back of my neck raised at the sight of her empty, soulless eyes.\n\n\u201cHow silly.\u201d She took my arm and led me again. \u201cI\u2019ll be here until such a time as it is safe for me to leave again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou aren't, you aren't going to-to eat anyone again\u2026 are you?\u201d I looked around. There were far more people on the streets than there are normally, and I was afraid one of them might, I don't know, trip on a stick and knock it close to us. I didn't know what her limit was, what she considered a threat.\n\n\u201cThat depends.\u201d She spoke with mirth. It was strange to bear witness to. \n\n\u201cI have a question.\u201d I stuttered, \u201cBut I\u2019m scared to ask you.\u201d\n\nShe laughed. \u201cWhy on earth would you be afraid?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't want you to eat me.\u201d A teenager walking a weenie dog gave us an odd look and crossed the street. I wished I could follow him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to eat you, Maker. I would have done so already.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2026 isn't really all that comforting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn't trying to be comforting; it isn't in my nature. I was trying to be *assuring*.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d She succeeded in that, I guess.\n\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s your question, dear? I am not patient.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you\u2026 are you the Headmistress at Bridgerton Reformatory?\u201d\n\n\u201c*Me?* Oh lord no, I could never. No worries, you\u2019ll meet her soon enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I don't want to meet her?\u201d Tears fell down my face at the prospect. I\u2019m so, so tired. I didn't want any of this. \u201cWhat if I want all of you to leave me alone?\u201d\n\nHer face soured, and my heart dropped. \u201cNow *that* is something you should be afraid of, Maker Bachvarov. There are far worse things in this world than to be eaten.\u201d\n\nI didn't say anything else for that walk.","75":" I knew when I married him that Don was a good man, but not a smart one. That's partly why I loved him. It's also why he was such a good fit for the Marathon County Sheriff's Department. Kind-hearted, followed orders, too happy obeying to ask questions. Exactly what you want in a cop.\n\nI fell in love with Don for a lot of reasons. He always stood up straight, always showered twice a day, ironed every damn shirt he wore. He was a proud man, and it was those little things he was proud of that I found so damn adorable. Gentle, too. Never raised a hand to anyone unless he absolutely had to. What didn't matter to me was that Don had never been the sharpest knife in the rack.\n\nI always knew Don wasn't smart. I didn't think he was stupid. I learned how wrong I was when he came home one night with that damn statue.\n\nWhen I asked him why on Earth he'd bring evidence from a crime scene home in the first place he told me he didn't know. I was sympathetic at first, you know? Not angry, not *terrified* like I am now. I thought he'd been unable to part with it because of some kind of post-traumatic stress.\n\nLike I said, my Don was kind-hearted. \"*Soft*\" was the word my father, who definitely *isn't* kind-hearted, used. That's another part of what made Don such a good cop in these parts though. You needed softness when settling violent disputes between drunk couples or picking up strung-out tweakers from the curb all day, especially when every perp knew you since you were knee-high to a grasshopper.\n\nMarathon County *ain*'*t* the kind of place where nights like the one he found the statue happened.\n\nIt was a triple homicide. Don had dealt with his share of murders, but never a multiple body count. I saw how rattled he was as soon as he damn near fell through the door. I'd been married to him for eight years, dating for six before that. High school sweethearts, that old chestnut. In none of those 14 journeys round the sun had I ever seen my man so pale, so shaking, so distraught. You know them photos of the WW1 soldiers with the thousand-yard stare? Yeah, if you do you've seen the look my Don had on his face that night.\n\nHe didn't say anything to me the entire evening. He sat down, put the statue on the table, downed a glass of water, then went to bed. Not one single word in my direction. Didn't even meet my damn gaze. I didn't find out from Don what happened but from his boss, Sheriff Harwurst, an old family friend (as most folk round here are).\n\nHarwurst painted a grim picture over the landline. Don had answered a call about a domestic disturbance from one of the other apartments in that complex. He'd arrived to find the door to the crime scene, apartment 19, hanging from its hinges. You could smell the blood in the hallways, apparently, but did Don stop and call for backup? No, he didn't. Not my Don. Daddy called him soft, but Daddy was an idiot. Don was kind, warm, had no roughness to his edges. What he didn't lack, though, was balls.\n\nThat's another reason I loved him- he had (metaphorically speaking) the biggest cajones I'd ever known to a man to swing. A gentle, fearless giant. So yeah, I had no reason to doubt Harwurst's recount of Don running *into* the apartment, firearm raised, ready to save a life, end one, or probably both.\n\nHarwurst didn't arrive until later, after Don didn't radio back. They sent the whole armed unit. They feared the worst, but what they got was\u2026 well, it was worse than any worst folk round here usually imagine. \n\nDon hadn't answered because he was curled in the fetal position in one corner of the studio apartment. I'd never seen Don cry, men round these parts *don't,* generally speaking. I didn't believe that part of Harwurst's story until he described the carnage he found Don amongst. \n\nAs I said, it was a triple homicide. Don't ask me who done it because they still ain't caught the sick sonofabitch. The victims were all male, all tweakers too most likely given the neighborhood Don found them in. Finding three bodies would have shit anyone up, and that's the truth, but Don was a cop. Three bodies in and of themselves ain't usually enough to rattle cops, especially ones with a few years under his belt like he had. \n\nNo, it *wasn't* finding three bodies that rocked my husband worse than I'd ever seen. It's what had been done to them *before* they died.\n\nThe sick bastard who killed them had made some\u2026 alterations. That's how Harwurst described it to me before I'd sworn at him so much he gave up being coy about details. I must admit I *still* regret brow-beating him into the full truth. He's a good man, and by the time I put down the phone, I realized he hadn't been trying to withhold anything from me as some kind of commentary on the emotional fragility of my gender. He didn't want to talk it out in full because he was shit-ass scared too.\n\nIt was impossible to identify the victims for a simple reason. They'd had their faces removed. The killer had stripped back the flesh until nothing but bone and muscle remained. They'd been thorough too; tongues, jaws, teeth, eyes, noses. Almost everything that wasn't the skull itself had been carved off. The wounds weren't clean either. They were jagged, ripped, the kind of wounds made slowly and painfully by a blade far too blunt for butchery. \n\nHarwurst's vivid description of the meatless skulls was in itself enough to buckle my knees so bad I had to sit down. His recollection didn't stop there though.\n\nThe faceless corpses had been positioned kneeling in a circle, facing inwards. At its center was a compost-heap of scraps of skin, bone, muscle, teeth, hair, eyes\u2026 all the offshoots and trimmings leftover post-mutilation. Other parts had been removed too. Every finger and toenail had been pulled out, hamstrings had gouged out and discarded to keep them immobile. There were also gaping holes between each of their legs. You don't need schooling in Criminology to figure the message behind leaving your man as anatomically endowed as a Ken doll. The swollen bruising around the castration wounds meant they'd been made when they were alive by Harwurst's reckoning. He also reckoned the horizontal gashes across each of their stomachs weren't made post-mortem, either. \"Disemboweled\" ain't a word I ever expected to hear in Marathon County, not on our side of the TV screen at least. The offcuts and offal from every wound and opening had been added to the mound of gore. I nearly puked when Harwurst told me there was enough of it stacked up to reach his waist.\n\nThe walls of the studio apartment were caked in blood. Every bit of furniture was smashed, most thrown across the room judging from the dents and holes in the cheap plaster walls. A CD player had been left on, playing Gustav Holst's *Mars* on repeat (which Harwurst sheepishly admitted he had to cross-reference to the track number against the list on the CD case to figure). They'd found Don curled in a ball amongst the carnage, sobbing at the incomprehensible violence and destruction around him.\n\nHarwurst sent him straight back to the station to shower and head home. That's why he was calling, to check in. The sheriff *didn't* know about the statue. I figured at the time it would be best to keep it that way.\n\nChrist, maybe Don wasn't the *only* idiot in this house\u2026\n\nWe didn't talk about the statue until the next morning. I didn't even register it that first night. My husband had come home traumatized by an event so horrific I was traumatized just from listening to someone recount the traumatic details. That's three levels of trauma I was dealing with, trauma cubed. Excuse me for caring more about my man's emotional well-being than some trinket he stole. \n\nI fell asleep holding Don while listening to him quietly sob. It was the first and only time I'd ever been the big spoon. He wasn't in my arms when I awoke. I found him downstairs, sat at the kitchen table, staring at the statue. *That's* when I noticed it properly for the first time.\n\nIt was placed atop the mound of viscera when Don found it. It was made of a material that resembled jade, if jade was the bright orange of magma. It didn't feel like jade to the touch, either. Despite looking smooth and polished it felt\u2026 rough? Rough doesn't feel like quite the right word though. Charged is more appropriate, almost like it *felt* how battery acid *tastes*.\n\nThe statue was of two men standing back-to-back. They were, to put it delicately, *huge*. They were a level of swollen that nobody could argue was healthy, attractive, or in any way a shape human beings were meant to be. Their stomachs sagged to their knees, ankles folded around feet so tumor-like that the stubby toes poking from beneath them were barely visible. There was no part of them that didn't sag, bulge, or droop, and all of it had been captured in hideously accurate detail by the sculptor. Every pore was visible, every hair-thin wrinkle and fold of skin plain to see. If the subject matter weren't so damn unsettling I'd have said it was one of the best bits of art I'd ever seen. \n\nThe sculptor hadn't given the orange-jade men faces. They had heads, sure, but both were depicted wearing tight bags or sacks that obscured their features. What *wasn't* obscured were the painfully tight-looking lengths of barbed wire wrapped around the bags. Just looking at it made my face itch, my insides queasy.\n\nAs I said, Don was staring at it when I found him downstairs. I asked him about it, and he said he didn't know why he picked it up. Shock, he reckoned. He couldn't stop thinking about it last night, he told me. The statue, not the\u2026 the incident. At the time I figured the statue fixation was some kind of coping mechanism. I know better now.\n\nI was gentle the first time I told him to take it back to the station. Reminded him kindly that having it was *technically* illegal, but given the circumstances, Sheriff Harwurst was sure to look the other way. Don agreed to take it back later that day, when he went down to the station to file his report of the previous night's incident now he was calmer. \n\nFor the rest of that first week, I genuinely believed that was the last I'd see of it. Then the weekend came.\n\nDon and I had a Friday Night Date Night agreement that was sacrosanct. Had been since high school. I'd given him a fair bit of slack during that first week. He was despondent, withdrawn, distant. Again, I put it down to the trauma. It's the *exact reason* I picked his favorite restaurant, *Mac's Steak & Brat Smack-Down Buffet*, for our meal. To cheer him up, and because he knew I hate *Mac's Steak & Brat Smack-Down Buffet* with a passion. \n\nYou can imagine my anger when I was left waiting there like a jilted high school kid for three hours.\n\nI was willing to look past a lot, but failing to follow Friday Night Date Night tradition wasn't on that list. Don was supposed to meet me straight from work, as he did every week. I'm sure you can also imagine how much calling to find he *wasn't there* further stoked my it. The final nail in my rage coffin was where I eventually *did* find him. More specifically, what I found him with.\n\nHe was sitting at his desk in his study. You can probably already guess what I caught him doing. Staring at that damn statue.\n\nDon didn't jump, didn't flinch, didn't even blink when I threw open the door. It took a good ten minutes of me yelling at him for him to mumble an apology. No amount of berating could conjure an explanation for why he'd not gone to work that day, or where he'd gone after I heard him leave the house that morning. I gave up digging for a reason why he still had the statue after an hour or two.\n\nI felt bad after my outburst. Don had gone through a lot, and when I calmed down I rationalized that I'd probably been unrealistic in my expectations of how quickly he'd bounce back. I apologized, and he agreed to return that statue and speak to Harwurst about some time off. I watched him take it with him in the car the next morning, just to be sure.\n\nAgain, I thought that was the last I'd see of it.\n\nDon was still withdrawn and sullen for the next few weeks, but I started to show flashes of his former self here and there. He didn't miss Friday Night Date Night again, that's for damn certain. I'm not a snoop either, and I always liked to give Don his privacy, but I have to admit I did search his study once or twice when he was at work during that first week. Just to make sure he'd *actually* made good on his promise.\n\nBy the time the night of the incident was almost a month behind us, I'd almost thought we were getting back to normality. That's when I got the second call from Harwurst.\n\nDon hadn't returned to work since his week of recuperative leave. At first, I argued. I saw him leave the house every morning, I said, uniform and badge ready in his bag. It was when Harwurst started mentioning how easy it was to lose said badge that I stopped playing incredulous wife and started listening proper. I didn't ask about the statue, both because I didn't want to get Don fired, and because I already knew the answer.\n\nWhen Don got back from \"work\" I was midway through tearing his study apart. He tried playing dumb at first, until I mentioned the call from Harwurst. He broke down at that, and confessed at least to his lies about his whereabouts. I took what he said then as the truth. I still feel like a fool about that.\n\nHe told me he'd been in bars, drinking. That he couldn't forget about the incident. That's why he was so tired all the time, he told me, so withdrawn, so unfocused. I also bought the lie about him throwing the statue in a river. Well no, I'm not giving myself enough credit there. I *didn't* believe him. I just *wanted* to. So much so that I made the unconscious decision to just leave it, to live in the fantasy land where my brave husband was a recovering alcoholic cop despite never smelling of booze or spending a dime.\n\nIt only took two nights for that fantasy to come crumbling down. \n\nI was woken by a crash outside our window. Nothing major you understand, probably just raccoons or the wind knocking some dead foliage our way. It was realizing that Don wasn't lying next to me that got my feed out of bed and treading as quiet as possible round the house. I heard him before I saw him, and because of that I managed to see him without seeing me. I don't know what would have happened if he had. I don't think I'd still be alive to write this, that's for damn certain.\n\nHe was standing in the downstairs bathroom, facing the mirror. It was the look in his eyes that made tears instantly fall from my own, that clasped my hand to my mouth to stifle a terrified whimper. I'd never seen that look on my Don's face. I'd never seen it on *anyones.*\n\nEvil. It's not a word I ever thought I'd find myself using in seriousness, or outside of church. It's the only one I have though.\n\nDon never smiled with his teeth. His reflection was grinning so wide I could see all of them, even the molars. His normally narrow eyes were stretched to perfect bulging circles. Ventricles and veins pulsed on their surface, and his left eyelid twitched without warning in an erratic, arrhythmic pattern. His nostrils were flared almost to the point of being level with his cheekbones, brows raised until it crushed his forehead against his hairline. The muscles and folds of the version of my Don in that reflection were stretched back so far that, if I couldn't see the back of his head from my perch on the first-floor landing, I'd have sworn someone was holding him upright by the back of his head.\n\nHe was talking to himself, repeating a single word over and over. \"Perfection\". It's a word I'm all too familiar with now, but that night it raised nothing but terrified confusion. He was dragging his razor across the mirror, like he was trying to shave the face on the other side of it. Over and over he dragged the blades across the glass. The squeaks and scrapes set my teeth on edge and the vertebrae of my spine to shudder. \n\nI couldn't stand to watch for more than a few minutes. As I said, the only word I had, I *have,* is evil. It wasn't light that danced in those bulging eyes. It wasn't the happy spark and joy I'd fallen in love with. What twinkled in Don's eyes the night was a cold, dead lust, a lifeless urge for things too foul for you or I to comprehend. A small part of me wishes I'd been carrying my phone, that I'd taken a photo. Unless you saw those eyes for yourself the above probably doesn't make sense. In fact, I kind of hope it doesn't. If it does, and you've seen eyes like my\u2026 like Don's, then your life is already, or about to be, as fucked as mine.\n\nI couldn't sleep that night. When Don eventually came back to bed a few hours later I just lay trembling in the dark, waiting until his snoring started to burst into stifled sobs. I left him a note when he went out the next morning. Told him he needed to sort his shit out, and that I was going to stay with my sister to clear my head. I couldn't tell him the *real* reason I wanted to get out of there, that I couldn't close my eyes without seeing a version of his face so terrifying it made the thought of being around him induce a panic attack. \n\nA week went by before I started to get worried about the fact he hadn't called. After a while, I started to think that I'd maybe been half asleep when I saw him, or that I'd dreamt it (God I wish that were the fucking case). Once more my negativity turned inward and I started beating myself up over my \"overreaction\". Don was unwell and I'd abandoned him, I told myself. I was a terrible wife. I'd left him alone when he needed me most.\n\nMy sister didn't share my view. She had made me promise not to go back to him groveling, not to make the first move, not to be the one that reaches out to break the ice. I broke that promise on the Saturday morning by phoning Don, and broke it again when I went home upon the call going straight to voicemail.\n\nIt had been a week since I'd last stood in my living room. Looking at the state of it, Don had abandoned it himself not long after. The whole house was trashed. Every piece of furniture had been pulled apart, or thrown across the room, or in some cases taken to with a sledgehammer by the looks of things. There were splatterings of blood here and there, pools of it forming around sharp metal edges and splintered wood where he'd pulled furniture and appliances apart with his bare hands. My tears started silently falling almost the exact moment I crossed the threshold into our once-beautiful home. I couldn't allow myself to believe my Don, my gentle caring Don, was capable of this level of wanton destruction, this carnage. I *wouldn't* believe it. \n\nI had to tip-toe over broken glass, wood, and plaster in almost every room. A thick cloud of dust sprang from wherever my foot fell, and there wasn't a single room that didn't stink of urine, rotting food, or both. He'd done that too, you see. He'd done it on our upturned couch, on the inside of our beaten-in fridge, and in the drawer where I kept out wedding photos. My tears weren't silent as the mental images grew more and more vivid. Each room gave enough new evidence for my imagination to make an ever-clearer montage of Don, with his bulging eyes and tooth-filled grin, ripping apart the life we'd built together in the most destructive, most barbaric way he possibly could.\n\nThis was *not* my Don. It couldn't be. But it was.\n\nIt was his study that broke me. When I found it I could do nothing but fall to my knees and weep. Unlike the rest of the house, the study was more or less intact. In here it seemed Don had decided to create rather than destroy. He'd built himself an effigy on his desk, a crude replica of two large, back-to-back figures I recognized immediately. I can't bring myself to write what he made them out of. My Don might be\u2026 well, he might be the reason all this happened, but I care enough for my memory of him that I *won't* conjure the mental image of him using his bare hands to make a sculpture out of\u2026 well, out of the *other* kind of body waste.\n\nI could smell it as soon as I reached the upper floor landing. It wasn't the disgustingness of it that pushed the last of my composure from me. No. It was the mental image of my once-proud Don, of the bestial, primal, horrific thing he'd become. It was the thought of the man I admired above all others broken, wretched, and weak. Despite my terror and anger at our destroyed home, all I wanted to do was help him.\n\nI was about to phone the only person I could think of, Harwurst, when something on Don's desk made me pause. It was a receipt for a storage unit on the edge of town. I knew the address, a friend of ours kept some of her ex-husband's stuff there after a messy divorce. I shouldn't have listened to my gut. It was my gut that told me *not* to phone Harwurst.  It was my gut that told me to put my phone away, to go downstairs, and get back in the car. It was my gut that convinced me I could help Don, that I could get through to him, and that once I found him at the storage unit we'd reconcile and he'd get better, that all this could be put behind us.\n\nIf anyone tells you to always trust your gut, don't listen to them.\n\nIt was easy to find which of the few dozen storage units Don had rented. It was late by the time I arrived, and it was the only one in the lot with a light on. Even if it hadn't been, the wiry old man in the booth was more than happy to throw the spare set of keys at me once I explained who I was. \"*That creepy damn guy with the bulging fucking eyes\"* had come to visit his unit a few days back, and none of the booth attendants had seen him leave. When I questioned why the police hadn't been called already, the man in the booth scratched his chin, looking sheepish. They were scared of him, too scared to phone the cops. Seems ridiculous right? It wouldn't if you'd seen his face in the mirror that night like I had. To me, the attendants' fear made *perfect* sense. I asked when the creepy guy, when Don, first took out rental on the unit. The wiry man told me it had been a few weeks prior, coinciding with the day Don had thrown the damn statue in the river.\n\nObviously, I was putting the dots together in my head. I'd blinkered myself to a lot that I should have seen coming, but I wasn't foolish enough to *still* believe *that* lie. As much as it made my stomach plummet I knew that when I found Don the orange-jade effigy would be with him. I thanked the wiry attendant before heading in the direction of Don's unit. The man in the booth seemed sympathetic. He let me know gently but firmly that if I wasn't back in an hour he would phone the police. Said he couldn't rest with my death on his conscience, no matter how scared of \"*that creepy fucking tweaker\"* he was. I didn't argue. \n\nDon's unit, Unit 19, was at the very edge of the lot. I couldn't hear anything except for the distant groan of traffic and the faint crinkle of a chain-link fence catching the wind as I approached. It was a cold night. This wasn't unusual with it being November, but for some reason, I became acutely aware of it in the near-silence. I could feel, hear, and see my rapid shallow breaths. I managed to get at least six into each footstep, the fog of my lungs warmth billowing from my lips. The handle to the door of Unit 19 was cold too, but much colder than the air. It was the kind of frigid that meant it almost burned to the touch. If my fingers weren't already trembling when they wrapped around it they would have been by the time I'd finished turning.\n\nThe units themselves were quite spacious as far as storage units go. Each had two rooms; a short hallway where one entered, and accessible via an inner door at the hallways other end was the storage area. The storage area had a rolling garage door to allow goods in and out of course, but this could only be opened from the inside. \n\nIt was for the inner door that I needed the key. The walk from the outside door to the other end of the hallway was one of the longest of my life. Mainly because, in here, I could hear Don.\n\nHe was bawling. Not crying, not sobbing, bawling. Like a toddler that had lost its parents, and not in the \"*at the grocery store*\" way. It was completely unrestrained in a way that I don't think I've *ever* heard an adult, man or woman, shed tears. It was a sound of pure despair, one you don't realize you're glad you've never heard until you do. The emotions that swelled in my chest when I heard it were as strong as they were complex. Sympathy, fear, disgust, care. The need to save and the need to flee started an intense battle within me the moment those sniveling wails hit my eardrums.\n\nDon's choking moans made the writing on the walls a hundred times more unsettling too, I'll tell you that for nothing.\n\nIt must have taken him days. The same word across every inch of brick, over and over and over. You can probably guess the word already. Perfection. What that word meant to Don I wouldn't know until the inner door to the storage area creaked open. I had to get there first. Even though the hallway was only about 10 feet in length, this was still a challenge. The cries and retches echoing off the dark bricks made putting one foot in front of the other a conscious effort. My mind wouldn't let me do anything but fixate on Don's reflection in the mirror; those eyes filled with their cold, dead lust. With every foot the distance between the second door and I shrank, the pictures behind my eyes grew more vivid. Over and over my sadistic conscience replayed the reel of Don smashing our possessions, of him urinating on our wedding album, of him tearing apart our house until his hands bled. Tears were streaming down my face, each one for the proud man I'd never known not to stand fully straight, and for the sniveling hunched creature I feared he'd become.\n\nAfter the key clicked in the lock, and the door to the storage area swung open, I knew straight away that the levels of terror in my anticipation were nowhere near enough.\n\nThe smell hit me in the face like a sack full of drowned rats. I actually took a step back, gagging and trying to pull my shirt up over my mouth to cover my nostrils. It was the same stenches Don had left in the house but magnified a thousand-fold. There were new layers to it here though, layers of mold, of decay, of rotting meat. There was no light on the other side. Light from the grimy bulb in the hallway barely made it half a foot before the shadows consumed it. The stench wasn't the only thing to assault me from the shadows though. With it came the flies.\n\nThere were *dozens* of them, *hundreds.* If it hadn't been for Don's crying I'd probably have heard their collective buzzing from the hall. I screamed, violently fanning my arms in front of me to stop any of the fat black buzzing lumps from finding their way into my mouth or nostrils. My anticipation was now a full-blown dread. Every artery thrummed from the sheer force of my frightened pulse. Fast deep gulps oversaturated my brain with oxygen. Black spots started tickling the corners of my vision, consciousness threatened to leave. My knees were midway to buckling when a realization slammed a fresh load of adrenaline through my veins.\n\nThe moment I'd screamed, Don had stopped.\n\nI called out his name but there was no answer. I could hear him in the darkness. He was standing somewhere on the other side of the room. His breaths were slow, heavy, and ragged enough to hear even over the horde of insects I'd freed when I opened the door. When he did answer a further two times I found my fingers tightening around my phone. Not to find help, but to find light. My palms were sweating so much that I nearly dropped the damn thing as I swiped my passcode onto the screen. My trembling index digit missed the button for the flashlight twice before finding it.\n\nThe *real* screaming, the screaming that meant my ears were ringing for a solid week after that night, started as soon as it did.\n\nThe first thing the beam of phone light revealed was the floor. The concrete was caked in both the bodily excretions the stench led me to expect, *and* large patches of dark red crust I recognized but really didn't want to. There were glistening chunks strewn across the floor, chunks of greying-brown that wriggled with maggots. Some of the chunks had hair, others had fingernails. One had a dead, glassy eye.\n\nIn the center of the room was the damn statue. The floor beneath it was clear, immaculate even. Don had taken great care to ensure that none of his mess, the destruction left in the wake of the man he'd become, touched it. I would have picked the damn thing up and smashed it right then, but I had another priority. Even though I knew I'd find them here, the two orange figures weren't who I came for.\n\nDon was standing at the other end of the room, facing the wall. The light crept up his naked, trembling body. Every inch climbed revealed a fresh wave of dread. My Don, who'd showered twice daily and took great pride in his self-maintenance, was caked in every substance spattering the floor. My beautiful Don, who'd never let himself slouch even an inch, now hunched over on a bent and crooked spine. My darling Don, covered head-to-toe in deep pus-filled scratches, burns, and blisters. The full image of the back of his naked body was too much. I yelled something. I forget what. What I said isn't important. What's important is the sound of words coming from my own mouth startled me. Startled me so much that I dropped the damn phone.\n\nI was only in the dark for a few seconds. I'd dropped to my knees to search around in the muck almost before I'd heard the clattering squelch of it hitting the floor. I found it in no time at all, pulling myself to my feet and pointing the light once more in front of me.\n\nStraight into a pair of bulging dead eyes and a grin that showed every tooth.\n\nSomehow I *didn't* repeat my clumsy mistake when I fell over backward. The phone stayed in my hand, the horror-revealing beam of light locked on the monstrous figure that was once my husband. Even hunched and crooked he towered over me. The look in his eyes let me know what I needed to; that it was over, that it had been the moment he was unlucky enough to be the cop who answered the call to that damn apartment. I remember begging him to get it over with, for him to kill me and end this nightmare. He didn't say anything back. He just stood there, naked and caked in depravity, grinning down at me with that\u2026 that *evil* face. I wish I could say that it wasn't Don but\u2026 but it was. Something in me knew that my Don, my beautiful Don, wasn't trapped by that face. It was his, no less so than the soft little half-smile I fell in love with. He wasn't possessed, he hadn't been taken over or inhabited by some demonic entity. This was him now. This was my Don, this was what he'd become, what he always would be.\n\nIn my mind's eye I could see him pouncing. I tensed, ready to fight him off as he tried to tear me apart with his bare hands. The moment never came. Twisted as it sounds, part of me *still* wishes it had, all these years later. What he did instead was far, far worse.\n\nWith a single fluid motion, Don reached with both hands and grabbed the back of his head. Grinning down at me, left eye twitching, he muttered one, single word.\n\n\"Perfection.\"\n\nThen he pulled.\n\nMy screaming had been caught in my throat while I was down on the floor with the dried blood, urine, and feces. It found its way back out as Don's muscular forearms wrenched his scalp. Even though my lungs were hitting decibels they never had I could still hear the tearing. It started at his neck, a thin line of scarlet born on the bulge of his throat that flashed up to his jawline within a fraction of a fraction of a second. The wet crackling snaps of flesh prizing itself apart grew louder the further Don's arms stretched from his skull. His scalp, hair, and face went with them. I retched at the sight of his eyes rolling back in their sockets, vanishing from view as the face around them when limp and sagged. Within a few seconds, he'd dragged the skin of his head and clean-off, sliding it from bone and muscle as easily as removing a hood. \n\nExposed teeth, bulging lidless eyes, gaping open nostrils. None of the nightmare-inducing anatomical horrors I'd expected were waiting for me under the facial skin Don tossed over his shoulder like a wet paper towel. This next part I know sounds impossible and is the *exact reason* I've spent the last five years in *Saint Dionysius' Home for the Incurably Mad*. This scrap of paper might be the only chance I get to tell my story though, and I'm *not* going to leave anything out. \n\nUnderneath Don's freshly removed face were two heads where one should have been. Two squashed heads that writhed and undulated to separate themselves and inflate to their full size. Two heads wrapped tight in orange plastic bags, bags kept in place by constricting lengths of rusted barbed wire\u2026\n\nI was already running to the door by that point, although my feet found it difficult to find purchase with the muck all over the floor. More than once I fell over in those few seconds before I finally found the hall. I got far too many glimpses of those two\u2026 those two\u2026  *things,* clawing their way out of Don's body. Somehow he didn't buckle until the very end. The two barbed wired crowned lumps clawed and fought their way from his neck, both against Don's flesh and each other. His chest and torso bulged and stretched as they pulled more of themselves from whatever hell they'd risen from. I heard ribs crack as one of the orange-head twins\u2019 wrenched an arm free, the back of my neck felt warm wetness as the other one punched through Don's stomach with a gnarled foot. \n\nI shouldn't have done, but I couldn't stop myself from taking one last, mortified look over my shoulder before I started running until they found me on the freeway three days later with bleeding feet.\n\nThe two figures from the statue were standing above their likeness. Don was\u2026 gone. Completely eviscerated. I don't know how, and I don't know why, but they'd used him as some kind of portal or opening or gateway. I'd love to think that wasn't what he wanted but\u2026 I still remember that face. His face. I think that was his plan all along. The moment he found that statue it had its hold on him, and I think this was always his endgame. The two men he'd birthed into the world with his madness would have dwarfed him. Each was easily over 7ft tall, and nearly as wide. Even over the stench left by Don's activities, I could smell the rancid mucus that covered them, the acrid ammonia burning that oozed from them with each of their labored, bag-covered breaths.\n\nAs I said, I *wish* I'd never looked back. Now every time I shut my eyes the first thing I see is that image, of them standing there in the blood and shit and piss, of one of them raising their tumorous hand and pointing at me\u2026\n\nThe next few years are a blur. By the time the waking nightmares started to subside I'd already been here at *Saint Dionysius* for several years. I'd apparently been pretty\u2026 difficult, let's say, during my time here. It's taken another few years for them to trust me with a pen. I've bribed one of the orderlies. He's going to get this out there, type it up and put it online. Everyone thinks that *I* killed Don, and all those people. I was too out of it to give my side of the story. I *need* to tell my side. I *need* people to know, need *you* to know, what really happened.\n\nI don't want to say what I bribed him with. I don't have much, you can use your imagination. Please make it worth it. I need the world to know. Not just because I'm innocent, but because those\u2026 those things\u2026 well, they're still out there. They have been all this time. If they could corrupt someone like my Don, make him become\u2026 make him do\u2026 *none* of you are safe. None of you. \n\nI hope the orderly makes good on his end of the bargain. I hope you get to read this. I was going to tell you my name but there's no point. You don't believe me anyway, do you? I'll know my stories out there, and that's enough. I hope you get to read this because, one day, you might find a statue of two back-to-back men that feels like battery acid tastes. You might feel tempted to take that statue, to keep it. \n\nPlease, even if you don't believe me now, when you find that statue leave it be. Walk away from it. Pretend you never saw it and live your life. And if you see the two men with their bags and barbed wire\u2026 well, I'm sorry, but it's probably already too late.","76":"When I was 8, I started to hear a sound in my ears. It was loud and constant, sometimes shrill and sometimes deep.\n\nIt was laughter.\n\nThe tone would change, but it was unmistakably a voice, and it was steady.\n\n\"Heh. Heh. Heh.\"\n\nWhen I was 9, I decided I could no longer take it, I had to tell mom. \n\nThe thought was almost more terrifying than the laughter itself. My mom had always struggled with her mental health. I never got to meet the woman my dad left, she was already deep in a state of depression when I was born. Throughout my childhood I sort of was a ghost, haunting the house like the ghosts who haunted her mind. I rarely told her any of my problems, I didn\u2019t get an answer often. When she wasn\u2019t working the night shift or sleeping she was staring at the wall across from her bed.\n\nShe did her best with what she could manage day to day, and knowing now just how hard she\u2019d been struggling all that time and managing to raise a child to raise on her own...she is owed the utmost respect from me despite the strained relationship we had. \n\nWhen I finally told her about the voice I saw, for the first time in my life, her cold dead eyes seem to light up, but the emotion behind them wasn't that of concern or worry. She turned her head from its ever-present state and stopped staring at the wall. Her sullen, tired eyes had become fearful as her cracked lips tumbled out a few words.\n\n\"The louder it is, the farther it is away\"\n\nAfter that, I spent the next twelve years suffering in \"silence\" while the laughter grew. When I turned 18 I left home and tried to get help for mom and I. Her mental health had worsened, and so had mine. She refused to leave the house, as usual. The doctor suspected we both suffered from a rare form of schizophrenic tinnitus, my mother being in the late stages. I took the meds, went over often to try and make her take hers. Life was good for a while, the voice was softer now. I met someone and we just moved into a new apartment. I have a dog, a pretty decent job, a healthy social life. \n\nBut somehow I knew it wouldn't last.\n\nThe past month mom had been worse than ever before, despite the fact the medicine had to be working, it was softer for me and she had been complaining...crying...about the silence. For weeks I've been staying here, back at home, taking care of her the best I could.\n\nThree days ago, the voice stopped. It was dead in the night, but the relief of pure silence roused me from my sleep. My mother's ear-splitting scream, however, woke me.\n\nI...found her. She was in bed, torn to shreds as if attacked by a rabid animal. The moment I laid eyes on her the laughter returned.\n\n\"Heh. Heh. Heh.\"\n\nI live in fear now, just as she did. In fear, that it may stop.","77":"Thick black smoke clouded any hope of me finding my way out of this labyrinth of corridors. The only light able to peek through the curtain of smoke danced disapprovingly. My throat, dry from days of dehydration, made the already intolerable air completely unbearable. I clutched the file I had found to my chest and continued for what felt like an eternity. Finally, I burst into the open air once again, struggling to get in even a single breath between coughs. All I knew was that now was not the time to stop. I MUST GET AWAY FROM HERE. I sprinted into the dense forest surrounding the concrete concubine I had escaped from. My efforts did not come without troubles though, I had cut my leg while hopping the fence and I was starting to lose blood. A lot of blood. Through clouded vision I saw a few dancing lights, before ultimately succumbing to my exhaustion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*CRACK!* Mrs. Dunnley\u2019s ruler slammed on the desk next to my head. \n\n\u201cMr. Michaels I suggest you pay attention, your grades seem to suggest that you do not have the luxury of sleeping through my lectures.\u201d\n\n \u201cSorry Mrs. M\u201d I said.\n\n Lately I\u2019ve been having trouble staying asleep due to continuing night terrors. It seems that sleep during pre-calculus fared no better. It had been a long day already, and my stomach, desperate for anything it could get, cried out in despair. Thankfully, pre-calc was my last class of the day before going home. However, something about these dreams I keep having felt too real to be true. Everything seems so vivid, the freezing cold snow on my bare feet. The way I can almost taste the smoke even after I wake up. I\u2019ve always had a phobia of fire for as long as I can remember, but I never seem to be able to remember WHY I have it. The drone of these fluorescent lights also provides me with a sense of unease. Another sense I\u2019ve never been able to trace. The bell startles me out of my train of thought, and I eagerly hop out of my seat and head to the parking lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy Mom was waiting for me eagerly in the parking lot, like she always was. If there was ever one constant in my life, it was her. And I couldn\u2019t be more thankful.\n\n\u201cStill having trouble sleeping sweetie?\u201d she asks as I hop in her car.\n\n\u201cYeah, I fell asleep in pre-calc again. Mrs. M was less than thrilled.\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou really should be better about that. You\u2019re always staying up too late!\u201d She scolded me.\n\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d I said. \u201cI just can\u2019t help it. These night terrors only seem to be getting worse.\u201d I continued: \u201cSometimes they even feel real.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think maybe you should see someone about it?\u201d my Mom asked.\n\n\u201c Nah\u201d I said, \u201cThey\u2019re only going to give me some drug that makes me feel like a zombie or lock me up in some facility.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being dramatic. It\u2019s ok to talk about the things that scare you ya know. Even if you are a man.\u201d she said. \u201cYou know I will never make you do anything you don\u2019t want to, but I still worry about you like you\u2019re my own, you know that right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes Mom, I know.\u201d I reminded her for what felt like the thousandth time.\n\n\u201cAt least give it some thought?\u201d she said, as we pulled into our driveway.\n\n\u201cI will Mom.\u201d \n\n\u201cI have to finish some important documents for work. Why don\u2019t you go lay down for a bit? I\u2019ll start dinner when I\u2019m finished. It\u2019ll give you something nice to wake up to for once!\u201d \n\nI went to protest, but after thinking about it, if anywhere was going to give me the best chance at restful sleep, it was my own bed. I threw my backpack in the closet, ran upstairs, ripped off my school clothes, and sunk into the comfort of my mattress. I let the darkness take me once again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately restful sleep would continue to evade me. The room was dark. Or something was covering my eyes. I could hear murmurs around me but I couldn\u2019t make out the words. I could feel them poke and prod at my skin in their latex gloves. Then the stabbing sensations started. It was horrible, the pain, excruciating. Stabbing in my arms, thighs, legs, neck. It felt like it was everywhere. No part of me was safe. Each stab I could feel the blood pouring out of me. I began to feel faint. As my consciousness began to fade I was able to make out one thing: \u201che is the key\u2026\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy eyes woke to darkness. My nose woke to vomit. But that wasn\u2019t quite it, there was something else there too. Fire. Smoke was already creeping into my room, it\u2019s familiar burn already stinging my throat. I rolled out of bed and hit the floor. I was luckily able to grab a pair of shorts and a shirt I had thrown on the floor earlier in the week. \u201cMOM!!?\u201d I screamed. No response. I shot across the hall as fast as I could manage. It seems like the flames hadn\u2019t quite reached the second floor yet. But I knew I didn\u2019t have much time. I rarely went into my Mom\u2019s office, most of the time she kept the door locked. Something about keeping work equipment safe, confidential data, etc. Now was not the time to think about that though, we had to get out. I rammed my shoulder into the door as hard as I could. No dice, It wasn\u2019t quite hard enough. I steeled my resolve, and tried one more time with all my strength. This time, I got through. \u201cMOM!!?\u201d I cried again. Still no response. I stepped into her room, the computer screen on her desk was cracked and black, smashed beyond recognition. The drawers were rummaged and there was a scattering of folders and papers all over the floor. Mom wasn\u2019t the most orderly but even this was beyond what she could handle. I remember what she had said earlier though, and grabbed as many papers and folders I could. The flames had reached the stairs at this point, and I didn\u2019t have a way out at this point, except for one. I made my way back across the hall to my room and opened the window.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI pushed myself out of the window as best I could while holding onto the folders I had.I landed on the ground. Hard. Thankfully, there were some brushes under my window able to absorb some of the impact, but that wasn\u2019t going to help my case much. I had nicks and cuts all over my arms from the shrubs. My right leg was hopefully not broken but had taken most of the brunt of the fall from the second story. I limped away from the house as fast as I could through the back yard. At this point I had no clue how long the fire had been raging. I went to grab my phone and realized I had left it inside in my haste to escape. \u201cShit.\u201d I thought. What the hell am I supposed to do now? Our neighborhood is at the top of the hill and we were all the way in the back. Even if one of our neighbors had called the fire department it would be a minute before they were here. I limped out front, Hoping to find someone, ANYONE that could help me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe street was empty. No cars in any of the driveways. What was a full and bustling neighborhood only a few hours ago was now a deserted ghost town. What was going on? Where was everyone? Where was my family? Who would attack us like this? Why would they attack us? Why me? Still in disbelief I sat at the end of the street while my life burned away in front of me. What now? Where do I go when I have nobody? It had been almost ten minutes, why had no emergency services showed up yet? The only thing I had with me was the papers from my Mom\u2019s office. Looking for some kind of answer I opened the first folder.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe paper that stared back at me was a medical file of\u2026 myself? I quickly skimmed it but there was one thing that stuck out. My blood type was\u2026. Y? I had never heard of that before. I knew all the other blood types. A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O- but never had anyone mentioned a Y blood type. And it wasn\u2019t positive or negative? It was just Y. How had I never known that about myself? I pondered. Why had my parents never told me? Why did my mom have these records and keep them locked in her office? There were so many questions and no answers to any of them. I needed more info. I turned to the next folder. It contained no useful info to me, it looked to be mostly financial records of something called the Youth Preservation Foundation. I noted the name and continued on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next was a report that looked useful. \u201cSponsored by the Youth Preservation Foundation\u201d *Blood typing and relations to cell damage repairs and genetic mutation protection.* This report was thick, I skimmed the glossary at the front for anything on type Y. I quickly found what I was looking for. \u201cThe results are incredible and unlike anything we have ever seen. Cell growth and repair is up 5000% compared to normal blood types. There are also additional strands of new and unidentifiable proteins that seem to protect the genome sequence from mutation. Aside from being virtually immune to damage from viral and bacterial infection, this blood type seems to lessen or ultimately eliminate the variance that causes many health complications in the elderly. With enough time and research, someone with this blood type can essentially become immortal to disease and aging. However, the most integral piece of this research is that this blood type can mix with any other type, and grant some of its effects to the donor! We have managed to neutralize neurotoxins, viral infections, bacterial infections, and have actively begun regressing the effects of diseases like Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, all attempts to recreate and reproduce these effects in other blood types have failed. We still have no way of creating more of this unique and highly beneficial effects aside from the natural production of the host\u2019s body. I will continue to monitor growth myself and promote a natural environment for them to age. This breakthrough is unimaginable for humanity and for science. I look forward to furthering my own research. -Dr. Nicole Michaels, Head of Research for The Youth Preservation Foundation\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHorror. Shock. Disbelief. Was I being toyed with this whole time? Was my family a complete lie? Suddenly the scar on my leg, and the scars along my arms made so much more sense. My family had always told me that I had been a product of an abusive adoption system and that is where all of my scars came from. My parents were never my real parents, but even my adoptive parents seem to be a farce. I began to hear the cry of sirens in the distance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA tap on my shoulder. A familiar face, one from school. She was in my grade. What was her name? Is she talking to me? Does she not see the house on fire? Why is she shaking me? What\u2019s her name? Why can\u2019t I remember anything? What is she saying? Where is she trying to take me to? Who am I? My vision began to fade, she was guiding me towards a car. Why are they taking me? Wouldn\u2019t the police and firemen handle getting me back to my family? Do I have a family? Who am I? The questions and memories overloaded my brain, and it\u2019s too much to handle. My vision shrinks once more and this time I succumb to my exhaustion yet again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy name is Adrian Michaels. I am the only known human being with blood type Y. It\u2019s been three years since I discovered that report. A lot has changed since then. This is not the end of my story.","78":"Freak. Four-eyed creep. Retard. Dickhead. Nerd. Douchebag. \n\nThat\u2019s how they used to call me in school. It\u2019s not that I couldn\u2019t fit in, it\u2019s just that they didn\u2019t allow me to. Always an outsider and never in the cool kids\u2019 groups, I didn\u2019t have any friends growing up. My family moved around the country a lot, so I just had to follow them to whatever city they headed to next. It was exhausting, but there was no other way around it.\n\nYou see, by the time I was fifteen or sixteen, I had already changed twelve different schools. My folks always said \u2018It\u2019s gonna get better, Danny.\u201d It never did, though. I was verbally abused, made fun of, beaten up, you name it. I was a constant target for the bullies of whatever school I found myself going to.\n\nI had almost lost hope. The dark bags under my eyes sometimes whispered to me it was time to give up and move on to another world. I didn\u2019t know if such a world existed, but I imagined that it had to be better than this one if it did.\n\nFinally, we settled in the town my dad grew up in.\n\nWhen one particular winter came, that thought was chased away by the snowflakes that fell slowly on the ground. It took just one night for the town to become an infinite vastness of white. A blanket of snow was laid on the ground, coating everything living in white, sending the world into a long, deep slumber.\n\nThe evergreen hung heavy with the snow that now laid on the branches. With every falling crystal of ice, the world became more silent. At night, I could only hear the violent beating of wind that screamed like a monster from hell outside my window. It made me wonder what lurked in the darkness of the night. What predators waited for easy prey to just appear before their ravenous eyes and sharp razorlike teeth?\n\nI shivered at the thought and certainly, I didn\u2019t want to find out. Somehow though I did. It was like some unseen force in the cosmos or an all-seeing eye in this whole universe wanted to let me know that there are other things here living with us.\n\nI woke up the next morning in an odd happy state. It was the last day of school before the winter break. That meant I had more time to focus on my projects outside school. I loved painting a lot. My parents said I was gifted with it. I never thought so. It was just a pure hobby that I very much enjoyed doing.\n\nI can still hear my mom\u2019s calm voice calling me to the kitchen to come and get breakfast. I instantly jerked awake, realizing that I didn\u2019t hear the alarm clock ringing. I quickly jumped in the shower, then went downstairs to eat.\n\n\u201cThere you are, little Goya! I made you some hot cocoa with scrambled eggs and toast,\u201d she looked at me, eyes filled with motherly love.\n\n\u201cMom, of all people in the world, I expect you to call me by my real name. I mean, Goya is cool and all, but I want to be known by my own name when I\u2019m famous!\u201d I told her and then we both started laughing.\n\nI heard the front door close shut. It was my dad with a shovel in his hand. \n\n\u201cPheeeew! I just cleaned the front alley, so we can leave for work, honey. First, we\u2019re gonna drop you off at school, kiddo. I think I\u2019m more excited than you for this last day of school, huh? Remember you promised you\u2019ll make me a nice piece to hang in my office, right?\u201d Dad asked me, his cheeks all red from the cold outside.\n\n\u201cYeah, dad, of course. It just might a while to do it, though. I just hung the phone with some rich guy who commissioned me to do a $3.5 million painting for him. Haha!\u201d I said after taking the last bite of food.\n\n\u201cReaaaal funny,\u201d mom replied.\n\nInside my family, I felt like a superstar painter. They were both so supportive of what I did and I didn\u2019t want to fail. Not them and not me. \n\nI loved Goya, Blake, Dore, Klimt, Beksinski, and even Barker\u2019s weird paintings were a source of inspiration for me. But I didn\u2019t want to be any of my idols, I just wanted to be myself. I think I knew that my own life and experiences had to influence my style as I progressed in life with this passion of mine.\n\nBy the time I finished breakfast and got dressed, the snowstorm outside had died down. The sun shily showed half of its face on an otherwise grey sky. It looked like a lightbulb that was close to death due to a terminal disease. Cancerous, sickly yellow, and depressing rays of light started to fill up the horizon.\n\nIt was like mother nature herself painted the perfect sad picture.\n\nWhen I arrived at school, I realized that I hated it. Not that particular school, but in general. What was the point of going there, if 80% of what we learned would never be used in real life? \n\nI walked a few more steps when I felt a boot kicking me in the back. The pain was almost instantaneous. It exploded from my lower back and crawled to the base of my head like it was transported by an evil elevator.\n\nI fell flat on my stomach and then someone took off my beanie and spat on my hair. A burst of laughter echoed throughout the corridor and I saw boots walking by passively with no intention to help me. A cacophony of voices echoed through the main hall, every one of them too busy or too cold to help or care about me. I just didn\u2019t want to get up, I wanted to lay there forever and pray to whatever gods existed that the earth under me would swallow me whole.\n\nThe laughter intensified and I heard that awful voice calling me names again. \n\n\u201cMorning, fuckface! How\u2019s it going? Did mommy drop you off again? Was it too cold for your little wiener to walk to school? God damn, I hate your face, creep!\u201d Kevin the Bulldog said. That was a new name for me. Of course, I ignored him.\n\nBullies hate you even more if you ignore them. I wanted to scream, I wanted to be strong and kick his face in but the effort was too much for me.\n\nHe was this big unhealthy-looking guy who only ate fast food. He used to steal money from other kids. We were all too afraid to tell on him and no teacher knew about his demented behavior. His dad was in jail for murder, while his mom used to sleep around to make some extra bucks; or so was the gossip in town. All this rage that he had inside, probably because he had a dysfunctional family, he needed to let out on weaker kids. That way he felt like he was somewhat superior. Maybe his sole purpose in life was to inflict pain on others. Maybe that was what got him off or made him happy in a sick kind of way.\n\nHe left with his gang of like-minded kids, their collective laughter reverberating in that otherwise lifeless building called school.\n\nI felt tears running down my face, their bitter taste slowly reaching my lips. I didn\u2019t hate the guy, I just wanted him gone. When I got up, I realized he stole the money from my wallet and he placed a chewed gum inside. It was disgusting to look at. \n\n*Fuck you, Kevin*, I thought.\n\nAfter school was over, I left with a sigh of relief and started walking back home. Between where I lived and school, there was a small patch of tightly knit trees. A small forest that was now sleeping soundly in a winter\u2019s embrace. After all, I\u2019ve been through that morning, I felt inspired by the events and decided to stop and contemplate those trees.\n\nThey were very tall and so close to each other and it looked like the night itself was trapped inside the forest. Even more than that, they looked like some eternal guardians placed there to look after what lived inside that small patch. To stay vigilant and to not let it escape.\n\nI advanced toward the small forest, wanting to get a good angle for the sketch I had in mind. If all went well, I\u2019d sell this online, figured it would make a few good bucks so I could buy some small Christmas gifts for mom and dad.\n\nI noticed the trees getting bigger and taller as I got nearer. I got my pencils and paper out and started drawing. Not long after, I got distracted by some voices that came out of the forest. There were laughter and popping sounds. It disturbed the silence and it got me off the mood for drawing. I couldn\u2019t draw unless there was absolute silence.\n\nAdvancing towards the place where the voices came from, I saw that there was a group of kids who drank beers and smashed bottles against some rock formations. They smoked cigarettes and played with fireworks, letting out strange crazy howls, while getting absolutely demolished from alcohol.\n\nI stepped on a branch and the cracking sound made one of them turn around. Seeing the face of Kevin the Bulldog, I instantly froze and fear started coursing through my veins. He grinned when he saw me, his eyes instantly shining with a crazy desire to hurt me.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an ugly face if I ever saw one! Whatcha doin\u2019 here, stupid? Did you follow me here for more ass-whoopin'? You kinda like it, dontcha? You\u2019re one of those freaks that love getting beaten up and hurt, amirite?\u201d he said, belching. He snorted and spat in my direction. \u201cWell, you got another thing comin\u2019, you fucking asshole! Boys, get him!\u201d\n\nThey all howled and ran to catch me. Kevin broke a bottle and its neck was the sharpest thing I\u2019d ever seen. \n\n\u201cWe gon kill this sonofabitch! Hurt him really good and draw a dick on his stupid face!\u201d another kid yelled. \n\nI turned around and ran like there was no tomorrow. I was scared for my life and the moment my parents would see me with my face all cut by some stupid drunken good for nothing bullies.\n\nI wanted to get home as fast as I could, but the longer I ran the bigger the forest got. I felt trapped inside the maze of my own demise with those little monsters that were out for blood.\n\nIt soon dawned on me that the worst monsters are humans. \n\nA wind started sweeping the forest as if a giant creature outside draw breaths in and then let them out. \n\n\u201cHere piggy, piggy, piggy! Oink oink, come on now pig! Run before we\u2019ll getcha. I\u2019ll cut you up real good and hang your skin in these trees right here! I\u2019ll bury you where no one will ever find you, creep!\u201d Kevin shouted. He was running out of breath, yet he still wanted to get me.\n\nWherever I looked, the trees got denser and the exit wasn\u2019t there. I felt exhaustion kick in and it wouldn\u2019t be long until my knees would be all rubbery and give out.\n\n\u201c*Hey, you! There\u2019s a trench to your left, go hide there*,\u201d I heard a voice giving me instructions, giggling. Beads of sweat started forming on my forehead, fear making itself room in my heart.\n\nThe voice sounded otherwordly and evil. It had an innocence attached to it though. I thought to listen to it because it was the best thing to do after all this endless running.\n\nI finally arrived before the trench. Looking back, I didn\u2019t see the bullies anymore, I just heard them making pig sounds like they were ready to be sent to the slaughterhouse.\n\n\u201cThank you\u2026\u201d I found myself saying, a sigh of relief leaving my lungs.\n\n\u201c*You are welcome, Danny! Do you want to be my friend?*\u201d the voice of a boy now asked me.\n\n\u201cWell, who are you? I mean thanks for your help but I don\u2019t even know you,\u201d I said.\n\n*\u201cOh, you\u2019ll see me! You\u2019ll see me and we\u2019ll play in the forest like friends. I\u2019ll take care of those bastards for you,*\u201d he replied. His voice sounded raspy as if he hadn\u2019t had any water to drink in a very long time.\n\nMy heart throbbed against my ribcage. The thought of another boy here in the forest, one that I didn\u2019t even know, made me even more afraid. I thought of the newspaper headlines the next day reading TWO LOCAL BOYS FOUND DEAD. THEIR BODIES MUTILATED BEYOND RECOGNITION. SUSPECT(S) STILL AT LARGE.\n\nThe bullies were coming closer. I could feel their need to hurt me and possibly kill me. I could practically smell my fear. It was a nasty smell, one that resembled rotten boiled eggs.I gagged and tried to hold back my vomit, but couldn\u2019t. I let it all out and that\u2019s when they heard me. \n\n\u201c*Don\u2019t move, Danny. Let them come. I\u2019ll get them and you can run back home*,\u201d the boy said.\n\n\u201cWhere are you? I can\u2019t see you! What\u2019s your name?!\u201d I cried.\n\n\u201cWho the fuck you talking to, freak? Have you lost your goddamn mind? I bet you did, didn\u2019t cha? Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I forgot stupid cunt faces like you have no brains inside their skulls,\u201d Kevin said, laughing. The other three kids who were with him laughed too.\n\nSomewhere nearby snow fell from one of the evergreen branches. They got startled and turned to see what had happened. I lunged forward and began running again.\n\nI prayed for whatever was in the forest with me to save my life and scare those bastards away. I felt tears in the corner of my eyes and I didn\u2019t know if I was crying or if they were there because of the freezing cold.\n\nI didn\u2019t even know how much time had passed since I got inside the forest. The wind intensified and the cold stung my face like a swarm of wasps wanted to make it all puffy and swollen before Kevin the Bulldog and his gang had cut it open.\n\nI heard them oinking and squealing like pigs do and they were all laughing like psychopaths. My very own life was at stake and I had to do everything in my power to survive.\n\n*\u201cKeep running forward and you\u2019ll see a large, old oak tree. There\u2019s a big hole in it. You must hide there. I\u2019ll turn their laughs into screams. Just like I screamed a very long time ago. I\u2019ll make the earth swallow them,\u201d* the voice of the little boy said again.\n\nMy heart began drumming inside my chest. I knew what he was going to do. He was going to kill them all. But how could he do it? It was one against four and his voice sounded tired like he was very frail and way younger than them.\n\nI got inside the tree hole and everything was dark around me except the opening of the tree. I could hear them approaching somewhere on my left, the snow crunching under the soles of their shoes.\n\n\u201cPlease, don\u2019t kill them\u2026 It\u2019s not worth it. I\u2019ll just wait until they\u2019re gone and head on home,\u201d I whispered inside the tree. I hoped the boy could hear me somehow.\n\n\u201cHi! I\u2019m Willie!\u201d said the boy now standing outside the tree.\n\nWhen I saw him, I froze. The functions of my body all ceased to work and an immense, dark cloud of fear fogged my mind and poisoned my soul. \n\nThe little boy couldn\u2019t have been older than ten or eleven years. On his right side of the head, he had a giant hole and frozen blood that had turned black adorned his face. The eyes were now a sickly blue, almost turned white, and they looked like they had stared death in the face. His hoodie was ragged and smeared with mud and blood and he was hugging a teddy bear at his chest. His jeans were ripped and he was missing his left shoe. All his toes were now black and gangrenated and worms squirmed between them, like dancing some sick dance of death.\n\nI thought I was going to pass out at the smell of death that was now making its way inside my nostrils. This putrescent and vile miasma was violently and rapidly filling my lungs, intoxicating me with a fear so raw that I never knew existed.\n\nThe freezing air sent invisible spears of pain and fear all across my skin. I trembled at the sight and I wanted to speak, but the words came out as silent vapors of heat against the dismal cold.\n\n\u201cPlease\u2026 Don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d That was all I managed to say.\n\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Danny?! We\u2019re best friends now, remember? Best friends forever,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cWho are you? How can you speak and live when you look like this?\u201d I instantly regretted saying these words. They sounded like what a bully would say. The shock was far greater than my ability to convey good phrases. My mind was racing and I wasn\u2019t able to say what I wanted to.\n\n\u201cWho am I, Daniel? Dead, that\u2019s who I am. I\u2019m a dead boy, killed without mercy here in the forest. I was murdered and buried here,\u201d Willie replied. I saw his face, or rather what remained of it, instantly darkening with anger.\n\n\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to say that. It\u2019s just that\u2026 I\u2019m scared, you scare me, Willie,\u201d I told him.\n\n\u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m dead or because they will be dead soon?\u201d He said, pointing to the four kids that now were approaching us.\n\nThey saw him and began laughing.\n\n\u201cWho in the fuck\u2019s name are you, pale face? Awww, look guys, he has a teddy bear! That\u2019s so sweet, you loser!\u201d Kevin said and they were all laughing again. \u201cWe\u2019ll kill you too!\u201d\n\nBut then Willie turned his other side of the head. They all froze and began screaming in fear. Willie dropped the bear on the ground and started limping towards them. \n\n\u201cShut up. You can\u2019t do anything. I\u2019ll kill you. You were trying to hurt my best friend!\u201d He shouted, his voice was now like he was gargling on razor blades.\n\nThey tried to move but couldn\u2019t. Willie got near them. A swarm of flies erupted from his mouth and enveloped all the bully group members. The wind intensified and I could feel the temperature drop by a few degrees. The deafening buzzing of flies tormenting Kevin and his gang was all but too much for me to bear.\n\nScared, I got out of the tree and then the earth started shaking. The flies rose the four boys into the air, and their screams were eaten up by the flies. It was like they fed on their fear and pain. Large roots rose from under the earth and Willie was motioning his hands, manipulating them. It was like they were listening to his commands. Snow and dirt were flying everywhere and the silence of the forest was no more.\n\n\u201cStop it, please! Don\u2019t hurt them, it\u2019s not worth it! Please!\u201d I cried. \u201cIf you do it, you\u2019re no better than them!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I not hurt them? They are the reason I\u2019m dead! They killed me a long time ago. Now it\u2019s my chance to return the favor, Danny. Because of them\u2014\u201c he pointed to all four kids that were now gasping for air with the roots squeezing them tighter \u201c\u2014 I could not rest for a very long time! I couldn\u2019t sleep, eat and be happy! I don\u2019t even know who I am anymore! I forgot most of the things from my old life!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has to be another way, please!\u201d I yelled as I saw the faces of the four kids turning almost blue.\n\nA large root rose from underground in front of me. It slapped me in my chest, sending me reeling back against the oak tree. My vision darkened and all I saw were stars. The air left my lungs, the wheezing sound resembling a broken trumpet. \n\nThe coppery taste in my mouth was very much taking over everything else I felt at that moment. I spat, the red saliva staining the white carpet of the forest. \n\nLimping, I tried to reason with Willie again. \n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t change anything, Willie. Please\u2026\u201d I said, coughing blood again.\n\n\u201cYou know what they did after they killed me? They buried me inside that oak tree there. You sat atop of my bones, while I tried to save you and this is how you thank me?\u201d he screamed, more flies coming out of his mouth and crawling back into his ears.\n\n\u201cDanny, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 We\u2019re all very sorry. Please, man, tell him to stop. We\u2019re dying over here,\u201d Kevin said, his voice cracking. It was the first time I ever saw him being afraid.\n\n\u201cYou shut up!\u201d Will said, the roots squeezing harder and harder, almost reaching their throats now.\n\n\u201cWill, you said they killed you\u2026 I could just call the cops and tell them I found your remains here. They\u2019ll know what to do,\u201d I told him.\n\n\u201cWell, not them! I told you it was a very long time ago; I can\u2019t even tell how much time has passed. It was their fathers. You see, their fathers were exactly like them. The bullies of the school. This guy, Kevin, right? He is the exact replica of his dad. Speaking of, he was laughing while he bashed my head in. The other ones tried to stop him, but it was too late, you know? Blood was pouring from my skull and then they just threw my things away and stuffed my body inside that oak there,\u201d he said as I stood there, in silence, not wanting to believe what had happened to this poor kid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m awfully sorry to hear that, Will. I am and I can\u2019t imagine what it must feel like right now. I know what it means to be afraid though, I was afraid my whole life of people like these four there. But it\u2019s not worth it, they\u2019re not worth it. If you kill them right now, others will take their place. It\u2019s a never-ending vicious cycle. Don\u2019t be like them, please\u2026\u201d I replied.\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Will didn\u2019t seem to find his words.\n\n\u201cKevin\u2019s dad is already in jail for another murder he committed. He might not be paying for what he did to you, but he\u2019s paying alright. I swear I\u2019ll call the police right now and let them know I found you. They\u2019ll give you a proper burial and I will be there to make sure that you can finally rest in peace. Would you like that?\u201d I asked him.\n\n\u201cYes\u2026 I am so tired of being like this. I just want to go to sleep forever or to whatever place might take me,\u201d he said, whimpering. \n\nThe roots loosened completely and they retreated back under the earth. Kevin and his gang tried to speak, but couldn\u2019t. I motioned them to go away.\n\n\u201cYou let all that anger consume you, Will. That\u2019s why you couldn\u2019t rest, I think. But it will get better, I\u2019m sure of it. Listen, you said you don\u2019t know who you are anymore? How about if I show you who you are?\u201d I asked him, showing him the inside of my backpack. \n\n\u201cWoah, you draw?\u201d he said, and now the flies formed a halo around his head.\n\n\u201cYeah, I try. Can I draw you? I\u2019ll make you a really cool portrait. But only if you get rid of those things.\u201d I said, showing him the flies with my pencil.\n\nThe flies vanished in a second. Will\u2019s eyes turned to their normal color again and I could see that he was just a sweet boy back when he was alive. I saw the light in his eyes, right before he was murdered.\n\nSo, I decided I\u2019d draw him using the hyperrealism technique. I wanted him to see and maybe remember how he really was. \n\nIt took me maybe an hour to finish it. We didn\u2019t say a single word in that time. \n\n\u201cAnd done!\u201d I exclaimed.\n\n\u201cLet me see, please!\u201d Will said.\n\nI turned the picture around and he just stared at it. Tears formed in the corners of his eyes and a sad smile escaped his mouth.\n\n\u201cWell, do you like it?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing I have ever seen,\u201d he replied. \u201cThank you very much, Danny. I\u2019m speechless. If I wake up again elsewhere, I pray that I\u2019ll remember this drawing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for not killing those kids. I\u2019m sure they learned their lesson,\u201d I said while putting the portrait inside a large notebook.\n\n\u201cListen, Danny\u2026 You too look just like him, you know? Like your dad. I hope he is fine. I sure missed him all these years. Thanks and hopefully I\u2019ll see you two again in another life,\u201d Will said, vanishing right before my eyes.\n\n\u201cI hope so too\u2026 Friend,\u201d I said, realizing that I was now all alone in the forest. \n\nI headed back home, thinking back on this traumatic experience. To think that I could\u2019ve been dead if not for that poor kid who saved me. \n\nMom and Dad were already home, drinking some hot chocolate in the kitchen. \n\n\u201cWhat on earth happened to you, child?!\u201d Mom screamed.\n\n\u201cHey, ma! I just slipped on some mud back after I got out of school. No biggie,\u201d I told her.\n\nI stood in the middle of the kitchen, all dirty and soggy. I was a mess and dad was barely containing his laughter.\n\nI took off my backpack and realized I forgot to zip it. The notebook fell on the floor and opened right where the portrait was.\n\nDad saw it and his face instantly turned pale. All color left his cheeks and he was as white as the snow outside. Then he just screamed and started crying. He just curled on the chair, shaking his head. \n\n\u201cDad, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, but figured the answer before he could say it.\n\n[\u201cThat boy\u2026 He was my best friend.\u201d](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PostMortem33\/comments\/gpnh5h\/story_masterpost\/)","79":"[Index](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FishermanTales\/comments\/qqfuq6\/old_man_guthrie_index\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI\u2019d never known Old Man Guthrie to be an Olympic level sprinter, and I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and say, for good reason. He\u2019d never been built that way, far as I know, and the night he darted barefoot up my gravel driveway, he was on the right side of eighty years old. \n\nWe\u2019d decided not to follow after him that night, assuming that if given another chance, he\u2019d catch us. Walton stayed at my place. Talked a whole lot. Granted, neither of us had it in us to try to sleep\u2014not after what we\u2019d just witnessed.\n\nSunrise came\u2014a welcomed sight\u2014and we decided the best course of action was to tell the neighbors, the Feltons in particular, as they were friendly with Guthrie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do the talking,\u201d I told Walton outside the Felton\u2019s door, who furrowed his brow and argued that he didn\u2019t see why that was necessary. \n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need you spewing a bunch of nonsense that\u2019s gonna throw the story into question. It\u2019s already unbelievable enough as is.\u201d\n\nWalton snorted and said, \u201cthey\u2019re called \u2018facts,\u2019 Cash. I\u2019m loaded with them\u2026 and if you don\u2019t want me sharin\u2019 them, well then fine. Ignorance is bliss, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlad we\u2019re on the same page.\u201d\n\nWalton huffed as I knocked on the door. Moments later, it opened up, and Roddy Felton greeted us. He was the husband. Tall fella. Friendly, church-going sort. We exchanged the usual formalities, then I cut to the chase and said, \u201cwe need to talk about Guthrie.\u201d\n\nRoddy frowned and asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cI ain\u2019t sure.\u201d I glanced towards Guthrie\u2019s house, then asked Roddy if we could talk inside. He obliged. Even let Walton join\u2014I would\u2019ve been of the mind to just leave him out on the porch.\n\nRoddy offered us some water, soda\u2026 beer. He\u2019d hesitated on that last one. I politely declined all three, while Walton agreed to a beer.\n\nI glared at Walton as Roddy headed into the kitchen, and whispered, \u201ca beer?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nine o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d\n\nWalton shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just one beer.\u201d\n\nRoddy came round the corner with a can of Bud Light and a bottled water. \u201cBrought you a water anyways, Cash. You don\u2019t have to drink it if you don\u2019t want it.\u201d\n\nI took it from him and thanked him. He told us the wife and kids were in town shopping, then took a seat and said, \u201cso, what\u2019s going on with Guthrie?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know where to begin,\u201d I said and glanced over at Walton, who\u2019d just taken a swig from his can, and noticed that he had a look like he knew exactly where to begin. I spoke quick to beat him to it, and said, \u201cwell, I\u2019ll just tell you what we saw.\u201d\n\nI proceeded to tell Roddy everything we\u2019d experienced the previous night, and once I\u2019d finished, sat back and waited for his response. He had a slight smirk when he finally spoke, and said, \u201cthat\u2019s quite a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I admitted, \u201cit sounds made up, but trust me\u2026 it happened.\u201d\n\nI could tell Roddy wasn\u2019t buying it. He leaned back in his chair and said, \u201cyou know, the other night Guthrie took a spill getting out of bed. He managed to crawl to his phone and call me, and I went over there and helped him off the floor. He\u2019s a tough old coot, that\u2019s for sure, but you trying to tell me that an old man who can\u2019t even get up off the floor on his own, is somehow capable of sprinting at what you call an \u2018Olympian\u2019 speed?\u201d\n\nI swallowed and stammered a bit, \u201cwell, he\u2026 uh,\u201d then, as I\u2019d feared, Walton decided he\u2019d been quiet long enough.\n\n\u201cPardon me, Mr. Felton, but might I redirect your attention to the part of the story where Cash mentioned\u2026 THE GODDAMN ALIEN SPACECRAFT?!\u201d\n\nRoddy\u2019s eyes narrowed. I laid my face in my hands and muttered, \u201coh god.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Walton,\u201d apologized Roddy, \u201cbut I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a perfectly reasonable explanation for whatever you saw.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. Aliens.\u201d\n\nRoddy shook his head and sighed, then asked, \u201cwhat are y\u2019all trying to accomplish by telling me all this?\u201d\n\nI looked back up and said, \u201cwe just think it would be best if you keep Claire and the kids away from him for now. Until we can figure out what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nWith that, Roddy stood, and with a smile, said, \u201cwell, I appreciate the concern, but I think we\u2019ll be okay.\u201d We followed him to the door, which he held open for us, and as we walked out onto the porch, his phone began to ring. He spoke into it briefly then hung up and said, \u201cClaire and the kids just pulled up to Guthrie\u2019s house. Brought him some groceries.\u201d\n\nMy and Walton\u2019s heads both swiveled, and sure enough, Claire and the kids were standing on Guthrie\u2019s driveway grabbing groceries from the car. We leapt off the porch, and ran towards them, hollering for them to stop. Roddy yelled frantically after us, then took off in pursuit.\n\nLike I said before, the houses ain\u2019t close. There\u2019s quite a bit of acreage between the two of them. We must\u2019ve been too far away, because Claire and the kids didn\u2019t seem to hear us.\n\n\u201cYou got the gun?\u201d Walton asked between breaths. I glanced over at him and noticed his grease stained ball cap had flown off his head, and the three stubborn locks still clinging to his dome, were dancing with the wind.\n\n\u201cNo, you do.\u201d\n\nWalton\u2019s hand dropped to his hip and he said, \u201coh,\u201d and removed the gun from the holster, then pointed it towards the sky and fired three consecutive shots, which finally startled Claire and the kids, and echoed off the nearby mountains. Almost immediately after, as Walton looked over at me with a satisfied grin, Roddy launched into his back and took him to the ground.\n\n\u201cShit,\u201d I gasped, and kept running. I waved at the family, having gotten much nearer, and Claire panicked and put the kids back into the car. Perfect, I thought.\n\n\u201cClaire!\u201d I hollered, \u201cdon\u2019t go in that house!\u201d\n\nBehind me, Roddy was back on his feet, also hollering, saying, \u201cClaire! Get in the house!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Don\u2019t go in that house!\u201d\n\n\u201cGo in that house and call 9-1-1!\u201d \n\nI stopped and spun around, and said, \u201cGoddammit, Roddy\u2014\u201c and found him pointing Walton\u2019s Glock at me. I quickly surrendered my hands, then peeked around to see Walton painfully stumbling back towards us. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking move,\u201d Roddy ordered me.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to save them!\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up. I don\u2019t want you weirdos anywhere near them.\u201d Roddy looked past me and yelled to Claire, \u201cgo inside and call the police!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t done nothin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat psychopath shot at my family!\u201d\n\nI rolled my eyes and said, \u201cthose were warning shots.\u201d\n\n\u201cBullshit. He\u2019s just too doped up to aim properly.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus, man\u2026 we ain\u2019t high.\u201d I turned to see where Claire was and saw that she was no longer outside. \u201cClaire go in the house?\u201d\n\nRoddy nodded. \u201cYep. The police won\u2019t be long.\u201d\n\nWalton finally limped to us and called Roddy a \u2018dickhead,\u2019 who quickly spun around and pointed the gun at him. \n\nSeveral minutes passed and Claire still hadn\u2019t come back outside. Roddy hollered for her, to no response.\n\n\u201cYou got to go check on her,\u201d I said, \u201cwe\u2019ll stay here.\u201d\n\nRoddy\u2019s jaw tensed and he pulled out his phone and called her, only for it to keep ringing and then go to voicemail. \n\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve listened to us,\u201d said Walton.\n\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Roddy barked.\n\nRoddy glared at me a moment and then said, \u201cstay here.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d I nodded. \u201cFine. But, look\u2026 I think you better get the kids out of there first.\u201d\n\nHe ignored me and raced for the house. Walton and I stood there watching, then looked at each other and shook our heads.\n\nWe watched as Roddy entered the house, and we waited a while, keeping an eye on the kids throughout. \u201cI don\u2019t like this,\u201d I finally said.\n\n\u201cThink we should go get the kids?\u201d\n\nI nodded and said we should, and right as we started heading over, Old Man Guthrie came strutting out the door with posture too straight for a man his age. It didn\u2019t look natural. He walked over to the car, grinning ear to ear, then opened up a rear door, and waved the kids out.\n\nWalton and I both gasped and started yelling to them. They looked at us and frowned, but Guthrie kept leading them towards the house. \u201cDon\u2019t go with him!\u201d I shouted, and that was it\u2014the last thing I\u2019d said to them boys.\n\nThey disappeared into the house right as we reached it. We landed on the porch and were met with a locked door. \u201cShit,\u201d I cried. I reared back and set my foot into it. The door gave way just in time for us to catch a glimpse of the basement door closing. We darted inside and found that it too was locked. I did the same as the previous door, but this one didn\u2019t give. \u201cHelp me,\u201d I told Walton, and we both kicked it. Still nothing. \u201cCome on!\u201d I cried. \n\n\u201cStand back,\u201d Walton commanded. He was up against the far wall. I moved out of the way as he pushed off and charged the door, slamming hard against it and knocking it off the hinges, but he\u2019d also managed to neglect the fact that the door sat at the top of a stairwell. Walton broke through the door and immediately tumbled violently down the stairs, all the way to the basement floor, then smacked solidly against a concrete wall.\n\nI watched in astonishment, afraid that he\u2019d just killed himself. He sat up moaning. \u201cYou alright?\u201d I asked as I hurried to him.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\nI looked around the corner for Guthrie and the Feltons and didn\u2019t see them. \u201cCan you stand?\u201d\n\nWalton held out his hand for me to help him up. We got him to his feet, but not without pain. \u201cThis has been an awful morning,\u201d he moaned.\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t over yet,\u201d I said as I crept around the corner. Walton reluctantly followed. \u201cYou see them?\u201d He whispered.\n\nI nodded to another sealed room. I\u2019d been in that basement before, and I knew that Guthrie had built a bedroom down there. \n\nI noticed laying outside the door was Walton\u2019s Glock. Roddy must\u2019ve dropped it. I picked it up, knowing then that whatever was on the other side, wasn\u2019t going to be good.\n\nI placed my hand on the doorknob and twisted, and was surprised to learn that it wasn\u2019t locked. I glanced over at Walton, who was wielding a lamp, and he nodded. We both held our breath and swung the door open.\n\nOur stomachs sank and a chill ran down our spines. Walton began to hurl. Old Man Guthrie had killed the Feltons. Not just killed. Mutilated. They were gutted. Blood and entrails spread across the bed and floor. Every one of them.\n\nGuthrie spun around looking like he\u2019d just woken from a bad dream. He was covered in blood with his reddened hands held out in front of him like he couldn\u2019t recognize them. He had tears in his eyes and his bottom lip quivered as he muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d\n\nI gaped at the gruesome scene, looked up at Old Man Guthrie, and shot [him.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/FishermanTales\/comments\/qjvwoi\/subscribe_to_rfishermantales\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)","80":"At the end of mainstreet in my hometown lies a small square. From where I live, it lies hidden, for the houses are aranged like the lattice on an apple pie, with a relatively low block of houses just behind my back garden. On the edge of this square stand a small church. It's not a particularly beautiful building - far from it. It's one of those smooth, square structures, with a steeple jutting up just a little too high to look pleasing. The only part visible from my bedroom window is precicely this steeple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-- MORNING, today --\n\nYesterday night there was a raging storm. And I mean a true storm. The wind was howling, dragging roof tiles up into the clouds. Rain was pouring down like a giant shower. Lightning was followed by a thunder that rumbled the earth. All was dark. I was sitting at my window, as there is a street lamp just outside, so close that my curtains don't fully block it - and I couldn't sleep anyway, with the storm raging outside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust from the top of the church steeple I saw a dark shape swoop down. It almost looked like a rain cloud which should have meant that it would have gone unnoticed, but somehow it caught my eye. Immediately afterwards a lightning bolt shot up in the same spot, but it too looked quite black. And it felt like the church steeple, as I looked at it, looked back at me, as if invigorated by this bolt of lightning. And then it fell back asleep just as quickly, like an eye blinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis morning the church bells sounded just as I woke up. They sounded ... different, somehow. As if their frequency had ever so slightly changed. And the look of the church I can hardly bear. The dark shape seems to have spread out over the building, leaving it in ever so slightly darker shadows than before. My parents don't seem to have noticed, and I don't blame them. It's still slightly overcast, so maybe this is to blame for the shadow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-- AFTERNOON, today --\n\nThe bells seem to have gotten louder and louder as the day went on. I can even feel it in my own body, as if my bones are singing with the far-off bronzen choir. Even though people say the sound may drive out demons (I looked it up on Wikipedia on my phone during that night, anxious and remembering something our local priest once said when I got a private tour as a little boy after having snuck off after our weekly service), I fear the opposite may be true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThough the church's eye seems to have remained closed during the day, I fear what it may do this night. The demon - if that is what it is - has not left the building, as its shadow is still hanging as a cloak around the steeple. It has seen me, and I have seen it. The sky is still overcast, and growing darker with rainclouds. I have decided I must pray, from now till when the sun rises again tomorrow. It seems the only sane thing to do. Pray and hope.","81":"The disc came in a red shiny padded envelope that was clearly meant for Christmas, even though that was over two months away.  It was unmarked other than my address and the postage, and my first thought was that it was some kind of junk mail\u2014some new software or a DVD sampler for some subscription service that hadn\u2019t heard of streaming yet.\n\nAnd when I opened it, there was a DVD inside\u2014not something professionally done with a label or anything, but one of those recordable discs that someone had written on in black marker.  It just said \u201cHome Security Vids\u201d.  Folded neatly inside the jewel case, like liner notes for some low-budget garage band, was a letter written in cramped handwriting on a single sheet of spiral-bound notebook paper.  Several white tags fluttered away like confetti as I slid the paper free and unfolded it, the scrawls of blue ink pulling me in as I put the envelope aside and sat down.\n\n**** \n\n*Hello Mr. Brewster.  You may not remember me!  When I was 15 I had to go stay at Parkview Home for Troubled Teens for six weeks.  This was before I got diagnosed and got on the meds to help me manage my bipolar.  I had a real hard time there, both because I was so lonely and because I was so scared I was crazy.  You were one of the counselors there at the time, and you were always real nice to me.  We only talked a few times, but you made me realize it was just my chemistry that was off, not me being a kook.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have made it without you.*\n\n*So first of all, thank you for that!  I was so happy when I tried looking you up online to see that you\u2019ve got a big practice in Denver now.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019re still helping people now just like you helped me.  I\u2019d like to see your office sometime, but Denver is far away and I know you\u2019re real busy anyway.  Still, I wanted to say thank you and congradulations on all you\u2019ve done!*\n\n*But I\u2019m also writing because I need your help.  I don\u2019t have many people here that I trust, and those that I do\u2026well, I don\u2019t want them looking at me like I\u2019m crazy if there\u2019s no reason to.  I know this doesn\u2019t make sense HAHA.  I need to get to the point.*\n\n*I think someone has been coming in my house when I\u2019m asleep.  Coming in and messing with me.  At first I thought it was my imagination.  But then I started feeling strange.  Weaker and less somehow.  And I swear, I can see it in my shadow.  It took me awhile to notice, but I think it seems lighter and thinner than it used to look.*\n\n*Oh BOY, you\u2019re saying.  This is a crazy one here!  Get the butterfly nets, right?  No, please listen to me.  I know how this sounds.  I do.  And I\u2019ve been doing really well for the last twenty years on my meds.  I have a job, I date people, I have friends.  I tried to ignore this for a long time, but it kept getting worse.  I kept getting worse.  And I was scared I\u2019m either crazy or someone really IS coming in and hurting me somehow.  Making me sick.*\n\n*So I got a security camera and set it up.  I didn\u2019t want to have it in my bedroom where I change and stuff, so I put it out in the hallway and checked it every morning.  The first few days, there was nothing on it.  Just a boring hallway.*\n\n*But then last night, I saw them.  Five dark figures coming down the hall and going into my bedroom while I\u2019m asleep.  And even with the night vision on the camera, I couldn\u2019t tell anything much about them other than their faces.  Their bodies were just long and billowy, like they had on robes or ponchos or something?  But their faces were glowing.  Not a lot, not enough I could see who they were really, but kind of like a glow stick a few hours after you snap it.  Maybe it was the camera making it look like that, I don\u2019t know.  But that\u2019s what I saw.*\n\n*Or I think that\u2019s what I saw.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m sending you this.  It\u2019s the video from the hallway.  I don\u2019t trust showing it to someone in my life in case there\u2019s nothing there.  And I\u2019m not trying to take up a bunch of your time and worry you with my problems.  Just please watch it.  Please watch it, and if you see what I saw, please write it on the bottom of this letter and send it back.  I\u2019m including a stamped envelope with my address so you can just drop it in the mail.  The disc you can keep or throw away.*\n\n*I know how all this sounds.  I do.  And I\u2019m going to move the camera into my room tonight, but I don\u2019t want to wait to send this to you.  Please respond when you can.  Thank you again.*\n\n*I just want to know I\u2019m not crazy.*\n\n*Sincerely,*\n\n*Marty Langdon*\n\n**** \n\nI reread the letter and then looked inside the padded envelope again.  He was right.  There was a small folded cream-colored envelope with the same handwriting on the front.  Marty Langdon in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nI tried to remember him from my time working at Parkview, but nothing came to mind.  It\u2019d been so long ago, after all, and I\u2019d worked with so many kids and adults since then.  Still, his letter touched me.  I was already running through possible diagnoses and scenarios in the back of my mind, but all of that could wait.  For now, this Marty Langdon needed my help.  He needed to be heard.  \n\nSo I put the disc in my laptop, checked it for viruses, and then hit play.\n\n**** \n\nThe entire video was only three minutes long, and the first two were just of an empty hallway lit in the ghostfire glow of infrared.  Then a shape began swimming out of the green-tinged dark at the far end of the hall.  It was a person in\u2026was that a mask?  It was hard to be sure.  Some kind of mask or facepaint that gave a slight luminescence but not enough for me to make out much detail, even as they drew closer to the camera.  Behind them, I saw another, then another figure come into view.  The fourth stepped from the shadows even as the first stopped at a door further down the hall and opened it wide.  In a matter of seconds, five figures of light and shadow had appeared and disappeared into what I supposed was Langdon\u2019s bedroom.\n\nMy first thought was that it was a prank.  But why?  It seemed unlikely that someone would target me specifically, and if it was random, how had they known who I was?  What I did for a living and where I worked twenty years ago?  This Marty could be behind it himself, of course.  Even if everything else he\u2019d said was true, this could be something he staged, and I\u2019d learned a long time ago it was folly to try and apply logic to an illogical mind.\n\nBut still.  It hadn\u2019t felt fake.  Not the letter, and not the video itself.  And I needed to start from a place of assuming that whatever had really happened, Marty Langdon needed my help.\n\nUsing his name and the address on the return envelope, it only took a few minutes to find a number for him, but it only rang.  My plan was to try the number again that evening, and if I still got no response, mail him back the letter with a note telling him what I saw and offering to talk to him if he wanted.  But that afternoon I got a call on the office phone.\n\nIt was a detective with Baltimore PD.  They were just following up on an accidental death case that had happened the day before.  A man named Marty Langdon had burned to death, and in looking around his home, they had found a partially written letter addressed to me.\n\n**** \n\n*How did it happen?  The fire, I mean?*\n\nThere was a pause, and then:\n\n**Well, that\u2019s the thing.  We don\u2019t know really.  The fire investigator has found no sign of accelerant, and none of the witnesses saw the guy do anything to himself beforehand, so we can\u2019t say it was self-inflicted.**\n\n*Witnesses?  Where did this happen at?*\n\n**Oh it happened right outside of Penn Station Garage.  The guy had driven there, parked his car and got out.  According to a family headed home and security footage we have, as soon as he stepped out into the sun, he goes up like a Roman candle.  Never seen anything like it.**\n\n*Oh God.*\n\n**You\u2019re telling me.  I\u2026Look, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going anywhere, but can I get a copy of that letter and video?  Any if he sent you anything else before he died, will you send me a copy of that too?  Just trying to be thorough, you know?**\n\n*Yeah, sure.  I\u2026sure.  Um, Detective?*\n\n**Yeah, doc?**\n\n*What did the letter say?  The one he was writing me but hadn\u2019t sent yet?*\n\n**Oh.  Um, let me see here.  It was weird.  Here it is.  \u201cI don\u2019t cast a shadow anymore.  They took it.\u201d  Guy was a nut, huh?**\n\n*I think he needed help.  He just didn\u2019t get it in time.*\n\n**Yeah, sure thing.  Wasn\u2019t trying to be disrespectful.  Just strange is all.  Thanks again for your time, and mail me a copy when you can, yeah?**\n\n*Yeah, I will.*\n\n**** \n\nThe next day, another envelope came.\n\nThis one was also festive\u2014this time with shiny green instead of the deep red of the day before.  I debated whether I should even open it at all.  Maybe I should just mail it to the detective instead.  But then I thought about my conversation with him, and about the poor dead man that had reached out to me for help.  \n\nI tore open the envelope and looked inside.\n\nThere was another disc in a case, but no letter this time.  Just a snowman sticky note on the front of the case with two words scratched across his white belly.\n\n**Help Me.**\n\n**** \n\nThe video was inside the bedroom now, and given the timing, I assumed it was the night after the last video.  A couple of days before Marty Langdon burned to death in the sun.  The time counter said it was five minutes long, though I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s possible.  \n\nThe camera had been set up in a high corner of the room, and I could see the man that must be Marty Langdon lying in bed.  Despite everything that had happened, real or imagined, he was somehow asleep, and he didn\u2019t stir when the door opened and the figures glided into the room.\n\nThey surrounded him\u2014two at his feet, two at his sides, and one at his head.  The head of his bed was against a wall, so the figure at his head literally stood over him, straddling his face as he stared down at him.  This\u2026what was this?  It wasn\u2019t a joke.  This man hadn\u2019t died for a joke.  So who were they?  And what were they going to do to him?\n\nIn unison the five reached up and slid away what I could now see were masks after all.  Masks that hid a brilliantly blazing light that made the camera switch from night vision to normal mode as they turned their burning faces down to Marty\u2019s sleeping form.  I could see some color now, see the tendrils of golden light shot through with something darker as it coiled from their heads and caressed his body.  Saw him sit up, eyes wide and blindly staring, jaw slack, as they coiled around him like snakes.\n\nHis thin, grey shadow danced fitfully on the wall, and as I watched, it seemed to grow even dimmer, a shade of a shade being slowly consumed in their terrible light.\n\nThis seemed to go on for a long time, and then they were done.  Marty eased back down into a troubled sleep and they slid their masks back into place.  They started to move toward the door when one of them paused.  Paused and looked directly at the camera for a moment before lifting a hand in what might have been a wave.\n\n**** \n\nI\u2019ve sent a copy of everything to the detective weeks ago, and while I\u2019ve tried calling him again, I get no response.  Not that I have more letters or videos to send him, at least not yet.  The camera system I ordered just arrived today, and I\u2019m waiting until nightfall to go out and get it.\n\nIt\u2019s just a confirmation, you see.  A secondary check on what I already know is happening.  Further proof that I\u2019m not crazy when I tell someone that when that shadow thing waved at the camera, it was really waving at me.\n\nA part of me knows this is all crazy.  Impossible.  Just like a part of me knows that if this is all happening, I should be able to prove it quickly enough.  \n\nBut I understand what Marty meant now, better than I ever did before.  The fear isn\u2019t just about being right.  It\u2019s about being wrong.  About people looking at you.  Judging you.  Pitying you for seeing what isn\u2019t there.  Being afraid of you for what you believe is real.  \n\nSo no, better that I use the cameras first.  Avoid direct sunlight and get hard evidence to back up my claims before I invite someone over some evening.  I\u2019ll serve them dinner and engage in polite conversation, making clear to them that I\u2019m still sane and civilized despite my impromptu sabbatical from the practice.  Then I\u2019ll show them some home videos without explanation and see what *they* see.\n\nOnly then will I ask them if they\u2019ve noticed anything.\n\nThey\u2019ll inquire, noticed what?\n\nI\u2019ll hold up my hand, perhaps cast in the light from the fireplace, and wave it around to give them a second chance.  \u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d  I\u2019ll ask.\n\n[\u201cI don\u2019t cast a shadow anymore.\u201d](https:\/\/redd.it\/9ndww5)","82":"Around noon today the Seattle area received a tornado warning through the emergency broadcast service on our phones:\n\nTHE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* HAS ISSUED A\n\nTORNADO WARNING FOR\u2026CENTRAL \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* COUNTY IN NORTHWEST \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*CENTRAL \\*\\*\\*\\* COUNTY IN CENTRAL \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nUNTIL 1215 PM PST\n\nAT 1145 AM PST\u2026 A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM CAPABLE OF PRODUCING A TORNADO WAS LOCATED NEAR \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\u2026 AND MOVING EAST AT 30 MPH.\n\nLOCATIONS \tIMPACTED INCLUDE\u2026\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\u2026 \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\u2026 \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\u2026 \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\u2026\n\nPRECAUTIONARY\/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS\u2026\n\nTAKE COVER NOW.

I knew I could get Amber Alerts (they happen depressingly often), but I\u2019d never seen a tornado warning come through on my phone. I was a bit worried because I live on a second-floor apartment in a complex with no basement structures, and the only windowless room in the apartment is the bathroom. I called my parents (who live in the next town over) about eight times in a row to make sure they were OK. Turns out they just have a really good sound system. They\u2019re out in the boonies, which had me worried. Two acres of trees just begging to come down on a double-wide trailer is just asking for trouble, but they made it out just fine.\n\nOne of my coworkers, a transplant from Arizona, called me in the middle of the alert freaking out because she\u2019s never lived anywhere where tornadoes were a thing, and like me she lived in a second-floor walk-up with a lot of windows. I thought it was weird at first, cause she never calls me for anything outside of work, but apparently she had the idea that we got these all the time (we don\u2019t). So I gave her what reassurances I could, and texted her when the All Clear message got sent out. She and her two cats are good.\n\nI\u2019m not worried about any of them. What worries me is that nobody saw a tornado.\n\nNow, normally this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. Just because radar picked up atmospheric rotation doesn\u2019t mean we need to call Helen Hunt and be on the lookout for flying cows. The bothersome thing is that almost everyone I talked to to make sure they were OK, well, they *heard* the tornado. They *heard* the thunder, and the hail falling, and sure, I saw quite a bit of rain and dark clouds. *Heard* all that other stuff, too. But I didn\u2019t see any flashes in the sky, didn\u2019t see any hail, and sure as hell didn\u2019t see a tornado. Some decent wind, but no tornado. No roof damage, no busted vehicles as far as I know. The most I can even find after the fact is a video of some high winds in the area (which, to be fair, did show a decent amount of hail, so I just might not have got any myself).\n\nBut all my friends and relatives are convinced they heard a tornado. And I know, you can hear thunder and not see lightning, and wind can sound pretty violent when your standing right in the middle of it all, but tornadoes have a pretty distinct sound. I found a couple on Youtube that sound pretty close to what my friends described, and what I heard. Like a train made of wind.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing, however, compared to what I saw. And as far as I know I\u2019m the only one who has. Against the advisory, I decided to step outside and get a good look at the sky. I thought if I could catch sight of any rotating dark clouds on the horizon, like some of the safety websites had said, I could get a head start on finding better shelter than my apartment. The majority of the sky, however, was just that weird mix of murky gray and off-white you get from thick-ass storm clouds. A little movement, to be expected, and the trees were certainly holding their own where I could see them, but nothing tornado-ish.\n\nExcept that god-awful roar of wind and thunder, like I was in the middle of the thing. The wind was a bit harsh, but nothing was coming off roofs, cars weren\u2019t moving an inch, and I even saw a couple of mildly distressed birds flying around. Also the rain. There was a lot of that going on.\n\nI wasn\u2019t the only one outside, either. Some other people had stepped out to get a look at this tornado they said they could hear over their TVs and headphones, but nobody saw anything. I think someone in the crowd had said the power went out for a moment, so it might be a generator or something, and either they all bought it, or pretended to buy it so they could ignore it, and went inside.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a fucking generator. I know generators. Lived in the area my entire life. We may not get tornadoes, but you can be damn sure your power\u2019s gonna go out a few times a year, especially in the winter. Hell, in the summer, when it\u2019s hot enough to fry your wires. I\u2019ve worked in warehouses, malls, hotels, nursing homes, call centers, and my family has owned generators of every shape and size. This wasn\u2019t a fucking generator. This was something huge, angry, and really fucking close by.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the only one who looked straight up at that moment. Several thousand people can\u2019t have missed it completely. Somebody else had to be looking for it. For something. Whatever was making that god-awful sound.\n\nAt first I thought it was the tornado itself, like I was in the eye of the storm looking straight up at it. A giant gap in the clouds, for a moment, twisting in place. Then I saw the other one. The other gap. Exactly the same size. Moving irrationally, but in sync with the other one. They rattled in place for a second before I realized what I was looking at. Or at least, what it looked *like*.\n\nEyes, rolling in their sockets. The dark clouds on the edge like a wrinkled brow. An expression of pain. Then the clouds split again, and I heard the sound, clearly, or maybe I was just understanding it finally.\n\nI didn\u2019t know the clouds could scream.","83":"My parents were out of town and I lived in a small neighborhood in upstate NY. My backyard was half cleared land and half dense woods. There was a small creek that ran behind my house too so I could see all sorts of animals at night including turkey, foxes, possums, raccoons and deer. \n\nOne night around 1 am I was on the couch in the extended living room part of my home where 3 of the walls had windows and we had a sky light. This is important because I had a complete view of almost all of my backyard up to trees edge. I heard the sound of a very angry squirrel for about 5 minutes and i kind of brushed it off because I've heard angry squirrels before. \n\nThen i heard the most terrifying screech, it sounded like a goose I had just been murdered and screaming. It scared the crap outta me and I immediately rushed over to the windows to see if I could see anything. I was worried it might have been a wolf since my neighbors cat likes to go wondering outside and usually kills a bunny or two and leaves them in our front yard. It was pitch black and my porch light barely illuminated anything but our back porch. I brushed off the noise and went to bed shortly after. \n\nThe next morning I headed over to my neighbors house who have hunted before and occasionally would bow hunt too. I asked if they heard that noise last night and they said yes, they thought it was a deer crying for help. They told me they were going to investigate the woods in a few hours to see what had happened. I was reluctant to ask to go with but I was determined to know what the noise had been. \n\nA few hours later my neighbors and me went into the woods, we didn't have to go far when we saw a dead squirrel pretty much ripped to pieces. We continued on figuring that squirrels don't have much meat on them so the animal probably tried to get as much as it could out of it. \n\nWe wondered for about 5 more minutes when we came across 5 dead bunnies, a deer and her fawn, and a dead goose. Now this frightened me the most, 3 of the dead bunnies had just their heads missing and the body was intact. The other 2 were ripped to pieces similar to the dead squirrel. I almost gagged at the smell of it all. I didn't dare walk towards the goose or the deer. My neighbor who had a bow on him walked towards the mother deer to see that she had long claw marks in her Torso and her head had been mangled. The fawn however had its head missing as well.\n\n Now the weirdest part of all of the dead animals was the goose. The goose was fully intact except that its lungs had been ripped open and all of its inner organs were gone. My neighbors wife immediately called the police and said that there was a bear roaming the property and was attacking innocent animals. I had my suspicions but I do not believe this was a bear. My neighbor who had the bow was keeping a clear eye on the surrounding woods like he was watching for something. His wife paid no attention to this and continued to talk to the police. \n\nThen it hit me a feeling of dread and chills. NY gets cold in the morning but this was summer and the humidity was usually around 90%. I could see my neighbor had the same feeling wash over him as he raised his bow and loaded an arrow into it. He told his wife to be quiet and me to stand back. I could not see anything but that feeling was still with me. My neighbor I know saw something but refused to tell me what it was since I was 15 and he probably didn't want to scare me. After a few minutes the feeling of dread was gone and the sound of something moving through the forest could be heard in the distance. My neighbor lowered his bow and told us we had to leave. \n\nWe immediately listened and by the time we got back to the small neighborhood the town police had arrived. My neighbor explained the story and the police advised us to stay inside. They later sent a few animal control people to survey the area to try and get the 'bear' away from the neighborhood. They came back empty handed. \n\nI never knew what that was that I was out there but i had done some research and I believe it might have been a wendigo by the dead animal killings. My neighbors refused to talk to me about it ever again. And my neighbor who had the bow seemed very cautious after that. If anybody has any insight on this, please say something. This happened a few years ago and I now live in a different state.\n\nEdit: I haven't told anybody this story because i thought i was over thinking which I do A LOT. Over analyzing is kind of my thing. I do not have contact with this neighbor anymore either.","84":"Before I start, I wanted to strictly specify that I cannot, and will not, name where I work. Only the town I live in-- Huntington, WV. But I suppose if my employers see this, It won't matter whether I say where I work or not. I'm toast, either way.\n\nNow, let me explain a few things first. No, where I work is not some school for the damned or hell, but sometimes I wish it were because you see, strange things happen there at night. Creaking in the walls, groaning in the lockers, the sound of what almost seems like tentacle suckers sticking onto the floor. I know better than to wonder what it could be, I don't want to know. I don't want to end up like my colleague who was split in half by a flesh-eating monster in the basement after he wondered just a little too far into the boiler room.\n\nI guess you may be wondering why the hell I still work here and well, at this point, I am too. Years ago, almost five now, I got a job here. At the ripe age of 16, I had dropped out of school and because I had nothing else to do, I got a job. Unfortunately, there are very few decent job opportunities in my area. That left me with a job at a little place near my house named Jolly Pirate Donuts, and the school. It didn't take me long to choose what I would apply for.\n\nThe janitorial job at the nearby school, which paid a whopping 30$ an hour. Yeah, that's right. Thirty fucking dollars. I remember shrieking the day I got the call that they accepted my application and that I would need to come in for training the next day. I slept so well that night that I nearly missed my training.\n\nThat's when I came to realize why exactly they were paying 30$ an hour. They began to inform me of what my duties would be. There were the obvious ones- cleaning, locking up, making sure there were no intruders in the building. Then they started with the more obscure ones. Dropping five pounds of raw steak into the boiler room every night, cleaning classroom 2b with special water they supplied to me that smelled distinctly of sulfur, never open the lockers past 12am, and the last one. NEVER go inside of the kitchen after closing hours. They never explained why, but they didn't need to. I got to see for myself one night after I caught some kids sneaking around inside of the gymnasium. I had chased them all the way into the cafeteria and suddenly, before I could even stop them, they locked the kitchen doors.\n\nI begged for them to come out and that I would let them go without calling the police, but they didn't listen. Within seconds I heard screams and saw what looked like a lobster claw before blood splattered across the walls, coating the cookware and spraying everywhere outside of the small opening that allowed students to grab their food in an assembly line sort of fashion. That morning when I came back after sobbing and throwing up I had finally seen what exactly happened to those two. Something had clipped them clean in half at the waist, entrails strewn about and guts splattered across the floor. I vomited again.\n\nBecause of this incident, I was allowed the week off, and so were the students. Of course, the students didn't know what happened. All they knew was that the school was closed for a week because of \"leaky pipes\", and that they had a whole week of sleeping in and free time ahead of them. I was equally as happy to not be in that place, but I didn't want to quit. I mean, would you quit if you were being paid 30$ an hour to follow a few simple rules and clean?\n\nI spent that week crying, despite this. I could have stopped the gruesome death of two poor teens if I was just a little faster. Eventually my therapist (provided by my employers) had convinced me that it wasn't my fault- that they were irresponsible kids and they had gotten themselves into that mess. I couldn't agree more, but the image of their terrified final faces and their entrails on the walls and floor couldn't be erased from my mind.\n\nNow, five years later, I still work here and I have enough stories to fill a Stephen King novel, but I suppose this is all for now. My shift starts in 10 minutes. I hope tonight is a normal night.","85":"[Part One](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qj0l2o\/my_dads_buried_secrets\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d stop the excavation job if you know what\u2019s good for you,\u201d the voice says.\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cThe excavation job has been put on hold because of the investigation, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nI nod, forgetting that I\u2019m on the phone.\n\n\u201cStop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?

Jet-lagged from the hours-long flight from my boarding school, I crash into bed and fall into a deep sleep.\n\nI sit up suddenly. A guttural scream wakes me. It\u2019s coming from somewhere deep in the house.\n\nA shiver runs up my spine.\n\nSomeone might be in danger. I get up, pulling my baseball bat out from under my bed.\n\nI advance quietly downstairs. I think the sound came from Dad\u2019s office. It\u2019s locked, but I know the password. Mom\u2019s name.\n\nWhat has Dad got in there? Has he kidnapped someone? I know Dad is crazy and over-secretive but this is wrong. I have to let that person out.\n\nI enter the password, door opens, I enter.\n\nLittle bright lamps show a long counter littered with countless different test tubes. Another counter with computers.

Surprisingly, it\u2019s unlocked.\n\nWhat the hell? It\u2019s a scene right out of sci-fi movie. What immediately catches my eyes are the two huge, cylindrical glasses that dominate the center. There is a naked female person suspended in a light blue liquid in each cylinder. I barely make out their faces as they\u2019re hidden by their hair.\n\nA whimper catches my attention. I tear my eyes away to see pieces of glasses on the floor among blue liquid further back. It turns out there\u2019s another cylinder that\u2019s been broken.\n\nA movement in the corner of the room. I look over. A person, white as a sheet of paper, crouched over, covering their face, whimpering quietly.\n\nI advance cautiously.

I\u2019m at some breakfast joint trying to shove some doughnuts down when a woman in a business suit with a smart haircut approaches me.\n\nShe smoothly inserts herself in the opposite chair before I could object, and gives me a smile completely devoid of sincerity.\n\n\u201cElizabeth Wells, how are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Eli,\u201d I say coldly, quickly finishing up my breakfast, \u201cand I have no interest in speaking with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI doubt that,\u201d she says, pulling out a tablet.\n\n\u201cI just got a call from the detective,\u201d I say, even though I know that she already knows, \u201cthe DNA samples turned up missing last night, and so have the bodies.

My father\u2019s secrets are not worth my life.\n\n\u201cMaybe I do know. Maybe I stole his files on the clone project before you people could tear our house apart,\u201d I laugh sarcastically. \u201cHow tragic this must be for you.

He was successful.\u201d\n\nI quickly finish my coffee, not wanting to hear any more of this.\n\n\u201cHe made perfect clones.

Between the constant screeching of unsatisfied customers in retail and the frantic hustling within fast-food joints, pest control doesn't seem all that bad. \n\nI mean, it certainly wasn't planned. The job was offered to me by a friend of the family, and I took it. Ever since then, I've been working with him, steadily learning the tricks of the trade. I suppose I should clarify that I'm not \"technically\" a pest control technician yet. I'm still in training, so a lot of the more advanced nomenclature used by those accustomed to the industry is still lost on me. Regardless, I've garnered plenty of on-field experience thus far, so I consider myself to have at least some knowledge. \n\nMy boss, Richard, is an older man. Despite nearing his sixtieth birthday, he still insists upon working his ass off all day, Monday through Friday. Hell, sometimes he even rings me up on Saturdays, requesting my assistance on some estates on the outskirts of the county. I can only assume the guy's got a love for what he does. His eyes twinkle with excitement every morning I meet up with him. Not a day goes by where his attitude delineates from complete adoration for his work. \n\nDespite being much younger than he is, I can't say my energy levels or work ethic match his. Still, the sheer excitement he brings to work each time (as well as several cups of coffee in the morning) allows me to get through the day. Usually, these days consist of us driving to a few homes, evaluating the properties, and treating for pests accordingly. Since I'm still learning the ropes, he often takes the time to guide me through my tasks. Often this routine goes smoothly. \n\nThat isn't always the case, though.\n\nIt isn't a big deal when something strange happens. Seriously, the occasionally odd events which transpire are hardly noteworthy in the grand scheme of things... I think. I try to push these things to the back of my mind, but they seem to keep forcing their way into my consciousness. \n\nI realize I'm being a bit vague, so I'll try to be blunt. There are things that I witness during our pest control treatments that I can't always explain. I try to rationalize them, I really do, but it doesn't always work out that way. When it's all said and done, they always entrench a profound sense of unease into my very being. These events can range from strange occurrences that can be chalked up to weird coincidences, to incidents that leave me scratching my head and thinking to myself, \"Jesus Christ, what was that?\"\n\nAs you may have already guessed, I would like to share some of these experiences. I think, for now, I'll start out with one of the more tame happenings I've come across. \n\nI apologize for the slightly misleading chapter title. Typically when one thinks of a hornet, the standard yellow-jacket comes to mind. I'm not referring to them, rather, I'm referencing European hornets. These things are real nasty, and grow to be much larger than they have any business being. They're about twice the size of a dime, and they don't fly solo, either. \n\nWe got a call on a Tuesday morning. A family of five was asking us to come to their house and check the place out. They reported smelling something foul coming from the youngest son's bedroom. They also mentioned that there was a small hole in the ceiling and that the stench was stronger in that exact area. We agreed to stop by and evaluate their house. \n\nAs we arrived, the father ushered us into the home, directing us up the stairs and into the bedroom. The dogs inside of the house began furiously barking as we entered, and the mother desperately tried to quiet them, all while managing her rambunctious children. Despite his large, imposing build, it was clear that something was off about the husband. His look was composed of both shock and worry, and the two elements mixed to form an extremely disconcerting expression. \n\nHe explained that before we arrived, his wife had been in the room alone, trying to spray some Febreze around to neutralize the odor. As she did this, she briefly heard the distinct sound of buzzing, before something landed on her arm. Suddenly, a sharp pain shot through her as something stabbed her skin. She swatted at the source of the pain, only to witness a large hornet flying off, landing on the ceiling near the hole, and promptly crawling back inside.\n\nAs we listened to the husband's monologue, I caught a glimpse of a pair of wings poking out from the hole. Richard noticed it too, and we both exchanged glances before excusing ourselves. We suggested the husband exit the room, and he did. We shut the door and Richard exclaimed that it would be a good idea to seal the hole before doing anything else. So, we retreated to our vehicle, grabbed a saw and a plank of wood in the bed of the truck, and sliced off a chunk of the plank to close off the ceiling. \n\nWhen we re-entered the room, we were relieved to discover that none of the hornets had ventured out. So, I was able to drag a bench over underneath the ceiling, carefully balancing on it and positioning myself underneath the hole. Using the piece of wood, as well as a few patches of duct tape, I was able to cover the entrance (and exit) which granted the hornets access to the house. The smell was overbearing; I was forced to cover my nostrils with my shirt to prevent myself from gagging. It was likely the excrement left by the inhabitants of the ceiling. \n\nRichard, who had been supervising the entire process, told me that we would go and perform an outside inspection of the property, for the purpose of figuring out where the hornets were entering the ceiling. Before I stepped down from the bench, however, I felt my curiosity pique as I eyed the wooden blockade I had set up. Extending my legs to their utmost capacity, I pressed my ear against the ceiling and listened. \n\nThe dogs barking, the children shouting, the voices of Richard and the husband conversing... they were all drowned out by what I heard. \n\nDozens of tiny legs were scuttling along the surface above me. Just inches of ceiling separated me, from the enraged cluster of insects. I could hear them rapidly flapping their wings, crawling around, attempting to exit the ceiling. I couldn't stop listening to them. The sound of buzzing held me in a trance, keeping my attention on it, and only it. It was only when Richard tapped me on my shoulder that I snapped out of my daze. As I walked through the doorway, I turned my head and glared upwards. The sound of buzzing still faintly occupied my mind.\n\nWe were able to locate the entry point outside. The hornets had been crawling through a small crack in the house, near the base of the chimney. A large swarm of them flocked around that area in the middle of the hot, sticky summer day. Richard retrieved a tool from his truck. A grey canister containing insecticidal dust was attached to a sliding pole. Using the pole to extend his reach, he was able to puff the dust into the crevices the hornets had been using to access the home. \n\nThe plan was simple. The dust was a fine powder that would coat the hornet's bodies as they traveled through it. As the access point to the nest was contaminated, it would essentially suffocate the hive. Without the means of workers safely entering and exiting their home, the structural integrity of the nest collapses, and therein lies the solution to our problem. After completing this process, we advised the family to keep out of the bedroom, even in spite of the barrier we established, and told them we would return at a later date to check on whatever progress was made. \n\nSomething strange that I had picked up on was that the family hadn't seemed to notice the hornet's occupation of their home until the day before they called us. This is something I would typically brush off. Usually, people don't know what the warning signs are for a pest infestation. It, therefore, makes sense that they wouldn't realize there was a problem until it became explicitly apparent. What didn't make sense to me, however, was that the family hadn't noticed the vile stench which plagued the bedroom, either. \n\nThe way the husband and wife described it made it sound as if the odor had spontaneously manifested one day. Even the kid who slept in that room every night hadn't reported the smell, which hardly made any sense. What were the odds that an entire family was that oblivious for so long? They had been living in that house for years, and I was expected to believe they hadn't noticed such a thing?\n\nAfter that visit, we waited for a while so the dust could take effect. Then, we scheduled a follow-up trip to see if the nest had been effectively destroyed. This time, Richard was standing on the bench, hacking away at the ceiling. The only way to determine whether or not our prior expedition had been successful was to directly investigate the nest, so removing a part of the ceiling to get visual confirmation was necessary. I stood beside Richard, lifting a cardboard box into the air. My purpose was to catch whatever came from the ceiling, be it dead hornets or debris. \n\nAs the dust rained down from above onto me, I tapped my foot impatiently, waiting for Richard to finish with his work. That's when I heard it. A light gasp exited Richard's lips. Although I wanted to see what was going on, the box I held above my head obscured my vision. I had contemplated shifting it to get a better view, but before I could fully entertain the idea, I heard something fall down into the box. \n\nThen another... and another.\n\nDozens upon dozens of objects fell into the box, each one landing with an audible thud. I heard Richard begin digging into the ceiling, working his knife around inside of it. I listened to the sound of chunks being torn out of the ceiling, as well as paper tearing, before a flood of individual objects descended into the cardboard I hoisted into the air.\n\nIt was at that moment that I grew curious. I desperately wanted to know what was happening above me. I instinctively began relaxing my muscles and lowering the box, but before I could, I heard Richard speak. Usually, Richard is a relaxed, mellow guy. But... his voice sounded different. The tone he used carried a hint of anxiousness to it. \n\n\"Keep it up! Keep it up,\" he repeated through his firmly clenched teeth.\n\nSo, I kept my arms upright, for what seemed like minutes on end, until the noise finally ceased. Then, something large and heavy fell into the box, causing my grip to slightly loosen, forcing me to readjust my position.\n\nRichard stepped down from his bench, releasing a heavy sigh before telling me to set the box down. I did just that, and when I looked upon its contents, I suddenly realized why Richard was so nervous.\n\nHundreds of hornets laid dead in the box. Their nest, which had been produced from natural paper, had been split open. It was massive, it had to have been several feet in both length and width. \n\nUpon closer inspection, I noticed that a few of the hornets had actually survived. This caused my body to slightly recoil, but Richard firmly pressed his hand against my back, urging me to look at the ones that were alive. I cautiously approached the box, viewing them. They acted as if we didn't even exist. All of them stumbled around, trudging along on top of the corpses of their brothers. \n\nRichard knelt in front of the box and picked up one of the surviving hornets. He placed it on his palm. I watched him dubiously, unsure of what exactly he was trying to prove. Rather than attacking, the hornet wandered around in circles, without any purpose. It was as if it were some kind of mindless zombie. \n\n\"I believe we killed their queen. Without her, the workers don't even know what to do. They've got nothing to protect, so they just walk around until they die,\" Richard said.\n\nHe flashed a smile in my direction before gloating about how it was the biggest nest he had ever seen. As we shoved the cardboard box, as well as its contents, into various black trash bags, I wondered if he had been trying to keep me calm and brush past the situation. It wasn't like I had forgotten his initial reaction to what he saw. I knew that represented what he truly thought far more than any fake smile or gloating ever could. He was worried. He knew something was wrong, and I did too.\n\nA collection of hornets that large, making a nest of that size, doesn't just happen overnight. Something like that requires years to take place. In those years, you would expect there to be some evidence of their existence. The idea that their stench, nor their incessant buzzing was picked up on far earlier by the residents of that house is something I'm incredulous towards. Maybe a mix of an oblivious family and a series of coincidences veiling the presence of those insects could explain it, but still...\n\nAgain, this is one of the tamer things I've experienced. I'm more than open to sharing more of my stories, but this is what I offer you, for now. There are still far weirder occurrences, I've discovered, than a phantom hornet's nest. We'll have to explore those affairs in due time. \n\nRegards,\n\nA Pest Control Technician","87":"After my mom died, I began urban exploring, also known as \u201curbex.\u201d It gave me a much-needed escape from our house. Everywhere I looked, sharp-edged memories threatened to cut me open. The pictures she\u2019d chosen to decorate the walls, or the armchair she\u2019d loved to curl up in. Chanel 5 floated through our home, an ever-present ghost. More importantly, urbex transformed the ordinary into the magical. That magic never lasted, but even a few seconds was enough for me. A few seconds to pretend Mom was still alive.\n\nI met Charlotte in ninth grade, when Mrs. Langdon asked us to do a group presentation on *Measure for Measure*. Charlotte\u2019s the exact opposite of me: bubbly, outgoing, and extroverted. But we bonded over our mutual love for urbex. Together, we visited the Chester-Hudson Quarry, Danvers State Hospital, Clinton Tunnel, and much more. We continuously challenged each other to check out bigger, creepier places, and quickly became best friends. Before Charlotte left to study history at Brown, we agreed that we\u2019d meet up during our breaks from college to continue exploring different places.\n\nKilmoure was our white whale. We had learned about it before the Internet became widely accessible, from a newspaper article that listed all the ghost towns in Massachusetts. At the time, we hadn't been able to find out much more. Admittedly, our efforts had been hampered by my dad. After Mom died, his protectiveness multiplied by one hundredfold. He became a stereotypical tiger parent, always demanding to know where I went, and insisting that I spend all my free time studying for the SATs instead of running through neglected buildings.\n\nAlmost four years had passed since we first heard of Kilmoure. Charlotte was the one who figured out that it had initially been called Kiltemoor when it was first founded, which explained why we\u2019d had such a difficult time finding out more information about it. Once we had the town name, we pieced together its history and location. Kiltemoor, or Kilmoure, had been founded in the late 1600s as an inland settlement. It declined after the American Revolution ended and a town called Larton rose into prominence. People built new coastal roads, ones that ran right past Kilmoure straight to Larton. During the War of 1812, even more people moved away. Rumors surrounded the very last occupants of Kilmoure; people accused them of practicing human sacrifice.\n\nCharlotte and I decided to explore Kilmoure on March 15th, right when our spring breaks coincided. Our phones died as soon as we entered the town. In retrospect, we should have packed up and left then. But we were too excited, too pleased with ourselves, to consider leaving.\n\nWe had no idea what waited for us there.\n\n\\*\n\nIt was a beautiful summer day, the kind you long for in the dead of winter when cloudless skies and warmth seem like an impossible dream. We drove up to Kilmoure singing along with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. While Charlotte consulted Google Maps, I daydreamed about all the amazing photos we would share with the online urbex community. To the best of my knowledge, Charlotte and I would be the first ones to explore Kilmoure.\n\nWe parked on the hill overlooking Kilmoure. When Charlotte turned off the car engine, a thick silence settled in our ears, only broken intermittently by a crow cawing somewhere far above us.\n\n\u201cDo you have everything?\u201d I asked. \u201cRespirator, first aid kit, flashlight, water?\u201d I knew she did, but we\u2019d gotten into the habit of checking with each other before going in. The half-face respirators were especially important because they protected our lungs from asbestos, mold, and even hantavirus.\n\n\u201cYup. I brought some extra food too,\u201d said Charlotte. She patted the side of her bulging backpack. \u201cAnd my Canon 5D.\u201d\n\nExcitement surged through me as we walked down the hill. We had dreamed about visiting Kilmoure for so long, and now we were finally here. It looked almost exactly like I'd thought it would. Nature had reclaimed most of the town, crowning it with wreaths of moss and robes of vines. While some of the stone houses stood tall and unbroken, others had been gutted down to their bones. Trees erupted out of crumbling walls. The largest building of them all stood at the center of the town. A school, maybe? I squinted at it. No, it was a church. The cross meant to be at the top of the steeple was missing.\n\nMy phone vibrated. I looked down and saw that the battery had dropped to 1%, even though I\u2019d charged it in Charlotte\u2019s car the whole drive up. Weird. I noticed Charlotte checking her phone too. Good thing we hadn\u2019t planned on using our phones to take pictures and videos.\n\nDid I know then that we should have turned around and run away as far as possible? Not exactly, but I would be lying if I said I hadn\u2019t experienced a moment\u2019s unease. Partially because our phones dying meant that if one of us had an accident here, we wouldn\u2019t be able to reach emergency services right away. Mostly though, that sense of unease remained undefined. It was the kind you feel when you\u2019re walking down an empty street late at night, and you hear someone\u2019s footsteps echoing behind you.\n\nBy unspoken agreement, we decided to explore the abandoned church first. Our plan was to slowly work our way outwards through the rest of the town. Unlike many of the other buildings, the church seemed relatively untouched by the ravages of time. It was made of grey stones covered with moss, roughly shaped like a pentagon, and had a bell tower from which a single, rusted bell hung. I suspected that if it weren\u2019t for its missing cross, this church would have looked right at home in any modern small town in New England.\n\nThe doors to the church opened easily under my touch. The smell hit us right away. It reminded me of the time I\u2019d accidentally left a Tupperware full of cooked chicken in the fridge for two weeks. By the time I\u2019d remembered that it existed, the smell of spoiled meat after I opened it nearly made me throw up.\n\nI concentrated on breathing through my mouth until I could walk inside the church without gagging. Although the church had windows, the light streaming through them wasn't strong enough for me to make out our surroundings clearly. I turned my flashlight on and saw a bunch of pews, eight rows of them. They had all been pushed to the side, as though the congregation members had left in a hurry. In the middle of the church, at the center of all the hastily pushed aside pews, was a giant hole in the ground, approximately fifteen feet wide. It had rough edges of splintered wood.\n\nFascinated, I moved closer. The darkness inside of it was impenetrable. I had the oddest sensation that there was something down there looking back up at me. I knelt down and tossed in a pebble. I counted until seven before hearing the distant clack that signaled the pebble had landed.\n\n\u201cEliza, look at this.\u201d Charlotte used her flashlight to illuminate a wooden pulpit at the very front of the room, past the hole. Cobwebs and grime hid its intricate carvings from view. On top of the pulpit sat a stone bust, roughly three feet tall. I trained my flashlight on it. At first, I couldn\u2019t make sense of what the sculpture was meant to depict. It seemed to have a human neck and face, but from its mouth upwards, its nose and eyes dissolved into numerous writhing snakes that then spiraled up into two twisted horns. Its mouth gaped wide open, the jaw dislocated in a soundless scream.\n\nI looked down to make sure the ground ahead of us was stable. A thick layer of dust covered everything. Except--I aimed the flashlight at the aisle leading to the hole and nearly forgot how to breathe. Footprints disturbed the dust. Small footprints, the footprints of children. So freshly made that they might have walked through here only seconds ago.\n\n\"Someone's here. Someone's playing a prank on us.\"\n\nCharlotte's voice made me jump. I spun around to see her staring down at the footprints too. Her voice had been so flat and emotionless that if I hadn\u2019t been able to see the beam of her flashlight trembling wildly, I would have said she was completely unaffected.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, trying to smile at her. \"They probably thought it would be funny to scare us. Remember the time some asshole dressed up a mannequin and put it by the hospital entrance?\u201d\n\nShe managed a shaky laugh. \"Yeah. That scared the shit out of me. Um...is it just me, or do you feel like barfing too?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that you mention it\u2026\u201d I hadn\u2019t noticed before, too engrossed in looking around, but I didn\u2019t feel so hot. My stomach kept folding over itself, sending up waves of nausea. Sweat poured down my forehead and stung my eyes. My respirator was working, I knew it was, so why was I having such a bad physical reaction to simply being inside a building?\n\nWithout warning, the ground started shaking under our feet. I froze for a second, hoping that the church wasn\u2019t about to collapse and fall onto us. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d I shouted, hoping Charlotte could hear me. Fortunately, we seemed to be on the same page; we both backed out of the church and started running back the way we\u2019d arrived. Less fortunately, the ground kept sending us stumbling over our own feet, and we struggled to stay upright.\n\nAs abruptly as it'd started, the earthquake stopped.\n\nAnd that was when the town *changed*. Everything around us wavered. The buildings flickered for a moment and looked whole and intact again. People streamed out of them, people who wore old-fashioned clothing that didn\u2019t belong in the twenty-first century. The men wore breeches, the women woolen petticoats. Children ran around, wearing doublets or gowns. We had been transported back in time. Or, more accurately, the town had been transported back in time.\n\nCharlotte hissed, \u201cThis has to be a historical reenactment of some sort! They\u2019re actors.\u201d\n\nInstead of answering her, I said, \u201cCome on, follow me.\u201d We ran around one of the houses next to the church and crouched down behind it, hopefully out of view. Right in time. The church doors slammed open with a loud thud and people poured out.\n\nThey had no faces.\n\nNone of the townspeople had faces. No eyes, no nose, no mouth, only a smooth blank surface. Like dolls that had come to life. But they seemed aware, capable of conscious thought. I watched as a couple of them paused in the street, tilting their heads to one side as though speaking to each other.\n\nI noticed something else too.\n\nThere was a procession of townspeople headed towards the church. The elderly led the way, all three of them hunched over. One used a cane to support himself as he hobbled forward. Others followed them; based on their height, they were most likely middle-aged adults. Teenagers brought up the very end of the procession. The church doors closed behind them. Only young children remained outside.\n\nScreams of agony filled the air. They went on and on, horrible and unending. Even clapping my hands over my ears didn\u2019t help. I still heard them. After a few minutes, the screams ended and blood poured out from underneath the church doors in a thick flood, soaking into the earth. We both backed away from it rapidly, neither of us wanting to be near it. The ground rumbled underneath our feet, sending us sprawling again.\n\nAll the children outside the church keened in distress, dropping to their knees and holding their arms into the air as though they were praying. I looked at their tearless, blank faces, my skin crawling with revulsion. How could they cry or scream without any mouths? I wanted--no, *needed*\\--to be back in the car, safely behind the wheel, and preferably driving far away from here. There was something very wrong with Kilmoure and I didn\u2019t plan on sticking around to see more.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try to make it back to the car.\u201d I pointed at the surrounding woods. \u201cThrough there.\u201d I tore off my respirator. There seemed to be no point in keeping it on. Cautiously, slowly, we shuffled through the woods, ducking behind trees whenever possible. But right as we reached the bottom of the hill, between one blink and the next, we were somehow transported back to the house we\u2019d been hiding behind. Disoriented, I stepped forward, and collided straight into Charlotte. Her dark brown hair was plastered to her face in sweaty strings. Above the respirator, her eyes showed the same confusion I felt. What the hell was going on?\n\nThis time, I didn't bother trying to be stealthy or quiet. Instead, I simply ran for it, leaping over fallen logs and ducking under low-hanging tree branches. I was certain that I\u2019d be able to leave if I just ran fast enough. I knew I was moving forward--I had to be. But my feet stopped leading me towards the hill on which our cars were parked, or maybe the path itself changed underneath me. Instead of running away, I ran back towards the house where Charlotte stood.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t leave. I pushed away that realization, the way you\u2019d push away some stranger intruding on your personal space. I didn\u2019t want to think through what that meant.\n\n\u201cMaybe we can ask the kids for help.\u201d\n\nI instinctively knew that we did *not* want to draw their attention. \u201cNo! Charlotte, don\u2019t--\u201d I lunged for her, but I wasn\u2019t quick enough. She walked out onto the street, everything about her wildly out of place, from the clothes she was wearing to the backpack she held at her side. The children didn\u2019t notice her. Hope swept through me. They had no eyes, maybe they couldn\u2019t see her at all. But then they started turning towards Charlotte, their blank faces shiny and unreadable. She faltered, stopped, and turned to run. She made it about five feet before they converged on her and pulled her down.\n\nSomeone shrieked loudly next to me. I whipped my head around to see a young boy leaning out from the open window of the house nearby, pointing at me while he screamed. I hesitated, uncertain. I needed to run, but I didn\u2019t want to leave Charlotte behind.\n\nThe choice was taken from me. Cold hands grabbed my shoulders and arms, dragging me forward. I knew with a sudden flash of terror where they intended on taking us. I struggled against the tiny hands holding me, trying to wrench myself free. I kicked at them, scratched them, even tried to bite them. But they didn\u2019t seem to feel any pain. Eventually, I stopped struggling and went limp, letting my legs drag behind me. I hoped that they might drop me, or at least slow down under my weight. Neither happened. They held me with unnatural strength.\n\nThe church loomed over us. They dragged us inside and I cried out involuntarily. The smell from earlier, that scent of rot and decay, was back. And worse. Blood and gore had been splashed everywhere, all over the floor and onto the walls. The pews held puddles of blood; it even ran from the ceiling, falling on us like warm rain. Thicker things dripped down as well, things inside a human body that you weren\u2019t meant to feel against your bare skin.\n\nThere was the hole in the middle of the church that we\u2019d seen before. It was smaller now, but I still couldn\u2019t see how deep it ran. Something in the darkness down there stirred as though it felt my gaze. I tried not to think about the fact that it looked just like a gaping, hungry mouth, one eagerly waiting to swallow us.\n\nCharlotte screamed, \u201cPlease, please, don't do this to us. It was a mistake! We made a mistake! You can't kill us because of a mistake!\"\n\nThe children ignored her. Those who weren\u2019t holding onto us dropped to their hands and knees. They abased themselves and made a sighing, whimpering sound.\n\nShe kept pleading. \"Please, you have to listen to me! We\u2019re sorry, we didn\u2019t mean to come here!\u201d\n\nA voice came out of the hole in the ground. It spoke to me. I don\u2019t know what or whom Charlotte heard, but it spoke to me in my mother\u2019s voice. Suddenly, I wasn\u2019t standing in the middle of a desecrated church, covered by blood and surrounded by faceless children.\n\nI sat in my mom's lap, only my feet sticking out, like when I\u2019d been much younger. Her arms held me, and I could smell her perfume, Chanel 5, and the clean scent of Dove soap. Her soft black hair spilled over my face. I tried to swallow past the lump in my throat. I had missed her so much. Tears trickled down my face.\n\n\"Mommy's so glad you made it here, Eliza.\" She kissed my forehead, leaving a waxy imprint of lipstick behind. \"I won't leave you again, honey. All you have to do is say yes.\" The arms tightened around me in a hug, one that hurt.\n\nI opened my mouth to say yes, yes, I wanted to stay here, I never wanted to leave again, and jerked back. I had been pressed up against her chest, but instead of that strong, sure heartbeat I remembered, only silence greeted me. No heartbeat.\n\n\"Eliza? Do you hear me?\u201d\n\nI stared up at my mom and met familiar dark brown eyes.\n\n\u201cAll you have to do is say yes, honey. Say that you\u2019ll always be mine. Say you\u2019ll worship me, obey me, follow me.\u201d She stroked my hair. \u201cWe can be here together forever.\u201d\n\nI dug my fingernails into my palms, hard enough that they started to bleed. The pain helped clear my head. I badly wanted to say yes, to stay here with my mom forever, but this wasn\u2019t really her. My mom was dead. I watched the realization slide into those familiar eyes, the realization that I knew it was just pretending to be my mom.\n\n\u201cIt can be as real as you want it to be, Eliza. *I* can be real for you. Look around yourself. There is no death here. The people in this town agreed to stay with me forever. And they always will.\u201d It smiled, an awful, vicious smile that didn\u2019t belong in my mom\u2019s face.\n\nI thought I understood. No one in this town could move on. They were stuck repeating the same motions, doing the same things, in an endless loop. Killing each other, killing themselves, all in worship of the thing that lived below this church.\n\nI shook my head wordlessly.\n\nMy mom wavered before me, shimmering like a heat haze. Abruptly, she vanished. I opened my eyes to see that I had walked closer to the hole. So close that I could see the faceless children throwing themselves down into it ahead of me. I stumbled backwards. A terrible tearing noise filled the air, the sound of something meaty being ripped apart. The snap and click of enormous teeth. Blood erupted out of the hole in the ground in a vast torrent. Chunks of thick, glistening flesh, shards of teeth and bone, exploded into the air and splattered all over me, the walls, the ceiling, everything.\n\nCharlotte walked past me. I staggered over to her. \u201cStop it, Charlotte! Stop walking!\u201d She didn\u2019t. Not knowing what else to do, I grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her, sending her head snapping back and forth. Charlotte\u2019s eyes cleared momentarily. \u201cEliza? What\u2019s going on? I feel...so...strange\u2026\u201d She started to move out of my grip. I took a deep breath, steeling myself for what I had to do, and forcibly dragged her towards the church doors.\n\nEach step was a struggle. She clawed at me, screaming, fighting to go back to that mesmerizing voice that promised her paradise. I told myself to hang in there, that this would all be over soon. I had to tell myself that or I would have given up and left her there after all.\n\nBehind us, the very last faceless child screamed. I looked back, even though I knew I shouldn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t help it. Something exploded out of the ground, something huge and monstrous that sent slivers of wood flying across the church. I couldn\u2019t comprehend what I was looking at. It was like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle with only a third of the pieces. I caught a glimpse of teeth, needle sharp and utterly inhuman, and enormous horns that spiraled into the ceiling of the church. Whatever it was, it tore apart the child in its grasp. It ripped the skin off her body the way an amorous man ripped off his lover\u2019s dress. Fresh blood and entrails sprayed through the air, and I choked on it, nearly slipping to the ground.\n\nAs soon as we stumbled out of the church, Charlotte crumpled to the ground and started to sob. I wondered for a moment if we\u2019d even be able to leave, or if we\u2019d end up back here no matter how many times we ran away. As if in answer to my unspoken question, the ground beneath us began trembling again. The buildings collapsed and disappeared, swallowed up by an enormous fissure in the ground that widened as it raced towards us.\n\nI dragged Charlotte up to her feet and we ran for it. She threw one quick glance over her shoulder, her face twisted in misery. I didn\u2019t know whose voice she had heard. If we made it out alive, maybe I would ask her. And then I stopped wondering what she\u2019d seen because I had to direct all my attention towards putting one foot in front of the other. I could hear my mom again. Knowing that it wasn\u2019t really her didn\u2019t help. I kept smelling her perfume, feeling her hair slide across my face. I remembered my dad telling me that Mom had been in a terrible accident, that the injuries had been too severe.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave me, Eliza, don\u2019t leave me to die!\u201d\n\nI closed my eyes and pictured her standing in front of me again, one hand reaching out to beg for help. No, she wasn\u2019t standing, she was falling. Falling back down the hole, tumbling helplessly through the air like a broken doll. The walls and ceiling of the church crumbled and fell on top of her, burying her alive. She\u2019d be trapped down there, left to starve away. She screamed and screamed, and I started screaming too because it was unbearable, I had to make it stop. My mom was dying again. I could taste Chanel 5 in my throat, could feel the delicate bones in her hands as she squeezed my arm, her fingernails biting into my skin.\n\nI\u2019d stopped running, stopped moving at all. I vaguely understood that Charlotte was trying to drag me forward. But most of my mind was occupied with resisting the urge to run straight back to the church. If I ran now, I could still make it in time to save her. She wouldn\u2019t starve to death. No, no, no, that thing wasn\u2019t my mom. I dropped to my hands and knees and started crawling up the hill. It didn\u2019t help. I could still see her, and soon it became more than just seeing. I was right there with her, the stones crushing my limbs and pinning me still. The dirt smothered me, filled my nose and mouth, and I couldn\u2019t breathe anymore. I heard her crying my name, felt her arms tighten around me for the last time, and a blood-soaked darkness swallowed my world.\n\nI came back to myself gradually. I was lying down in the backseat of someone\u2019s car. Charlotte\u2019s car. I pushed myself up to one elbow and saw Charlotte in the driver\u2019s seat, her eyes huge and terrified. They flicked up to the rearview mirror and met mine briefly before turning back to the road. Neither of us spoke. I didn\u2019t care where we were, or even where we were going. As long as we got the fuck away from Kilmoure.\n\n\\*\n\nCharlotte and I drifted apart. For some people, going through something traumatic together forges indestructible bonds. For others, it breaks them apart. We couldn't heal from what happened together. All we could do was remind each other of the worst moment of our lives. The last I heard, she dropped out of Brown and moved back home. That was four months ago. I don\u2019t know where she is now.\n\nI haven\u2019t gone urban exploring since that day in Kilmoure. I can\u2019t. Every time I step into an unlit building now, even my own apartment, I remember standing in that church and seeing blood spurting out of the hole. My chest seizes up and I can\u2019t breathe, not until I turn on all the lights.\n\nWorse than that though, I dream of my mom almost every single night. Not as she was alive, but as I saw her in Kilmoure. Buried under mounds of broken stones and pieces of wood and dirt. Trapped and slowly dying; begging me to save her. I reach out to help her, to pull her up, and realize too late that she doesn\u2019t have a face anymore. Whenever I wake up from one of these nightmares, I always find myself walking down the road, on my way back to Kilmoure.\n\nSo, I wrote this post to warn you. You and everyone else on this forum who loves urbex, or who is interested in visiting ghost towns. Massachusetts has a variety of abandoned places. In addition to the ones I mentioned earlier--the Chester-Hudson Quarry, Danvers State Hospital, and Clinton Tunnel--there\u2019s also the North Truro Air Station, Rutland Prison Camp, and Steinert Hall. All of them are great places to explore.\n\nJust don\u2019t go to a ghost town called Kilmoure.\n\nYou won\u2019t make it back [out](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Certain_Emergency122\/).\n\n[ODD](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Odd_directions\/)","88":"Taking off in a spaceship is one of the most uniquely terrifying things I\u2019ve ever experienced.  You sit waiting, strapped into a seat with your body flipped ninety degrees, facing the sky like you\u2019re waiting for a rollercoaster ride to start.  As preflight checks go on and on endlessly, you just sit there uncomfortably waiting.  Everything is done remotely so there is nothing for you to do but listen. \n\nAs the preflight checks finish, systems begin to turn on beneath you one by one.  Clicks and groans and strange noises of things engaging fill your ears as your heart begins to pound with anticipation.  It feels as if a giant creature is waking up beneath you.  Then the countdown begins.  \n\nOnce you hear the word zero, it\u2019s hard to think of anything.  Your adrenaline takes over as a rumbling roar begins to reverberate the entire ship and your body with it.  You feel yourself being lifted into the air and then a kick rattles you to your bones as the main engines engage.  That\u2019s when things really start to get gnarly.  \n\nThe weight of the G-forces pressing down on your chest makes it difficult to breathe as you shake like a paint can getting mixed at the hardware store.  Your entire body feels so heavy it sinks back into the chair and you feel like you weigh a million billion pounds.  The next sensation is like a punch being driven into your gut and all over your entire body - refusing to release, not letting up.  You feel as if your bones will break from the pressure, as if your heart will be flattened and your brain will melt.    \n\nThen slowly it begins to dissipate.  It takes a few moments for you to realize, while you recover from what just happened, but it dawns on you suddenly.  You feel different.  You suddenly weigh nothing at all.  \n\nThe only thing preventing you from floating around the cabin is the straps holding you in place.  The flight only lasts for a few minutes so you can\u2019t take those off, but you can imagine what it would feel like if you did.  Especially after all those times riding the vomit comet.    \n\nI looked over at the billionaire\u2019s face to see him smiling wide.  I don\u2019t want to say his name here.  I\u2019m afraid of the consequences if I do.  Even more so after what happened.  So I\u2019ll just call him Jay.\n\nLooking out the window, I could see the earth far down below us, speeding past at high speeds.  The sensation was surreal and I couldn\u2019t help but join Jay in grinning wide as we watched the beautiful world pass by down below.      \n\nThe other passengers were equally as enchanted by the sight and all of us sat silently, just taking it in.  The blue planet passed by silently beneath us, blanketed in white clouds which looked new and different from this angle.  It felt like sacrilege to speak at that moment, as if we were in church during a prayer.\n\nBut then something happened.  A loud POP!  The sound surprised us all and the ship began to shake with a slight tremor, as if it had been knocked slightly off course.  I heard sirens and alarms begin to blare.  Lights were flashing and ground control called up to us asking if we were okay.  \n\nI didn\u2019t know how to reply.  I looked around to see the other passengers were still recovering, glancing around the cabin with terrified, wide eyes.  Every possible scenario of awful things that could happen ran through my mind and I had no idea what to say to the people back at base.  Were we okay?  How was it possible for us to know?  What if our oxygen levels were slowly dropping or the pressure of the cabin was slowly increasing?  Wasn\u2019t that what they were supposed to tell US?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d said Jay robotically, looking far more calm than the rest of us.  I looked at his chest and saw a spot of blood there, about the size of a dime.  \u201cTurn off the alarms, please, Ground Control.\u201d\n\nThe alarms died off one by one but some were still blaring loudly and a few lights were flashing.  \n\n\u201cAll of them.\u201d\n\nHis voice was different from normal.  The grin on his face was gone as well, replaced by a calm, flat affect that made him look completely stoic.  \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding,\u201d I said to him, unsure how that could have happened.  \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d  \n\nHe looked down at himself and touched the blood through his gloved hand, holding up his finger to inspect it.  \n\n\u201cI am bleeding.  Thank you for letting me know.  I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nGround control was in my ear, speaking rapidly. \n\n\u201cSay again, who\u2019s bleeding?  Is someone injured up there?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing to worry about,\u201d said Jay.  \u201cIt\u2019s from a couple days ago, a small kitchen accident.  The G-forces must have reopened the wound.  Is everything stabilized?  Life support systems are normal, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ship may have been punctured by an MMOD.  The hull is designed to withstand an event like this so you should be alright for the rest of the trip if you want to continue,\u201d said the head flight technician at ground control, sounding nervous but clearly wanting to appease his boss.  Everyone knew how much he had been looking forward to this.  A piece of space debris wasn\u2019t going to stop Jay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re good if you are,\u201d he said, not asking us what we thought of that idea.  \n\nThe engineers back at home base responded in the affirmative and we continued our flight, landing a few minutes later.  Nobody dared to question the boss when he said to continue the journey as planned.  \n\nThe rest of the flight was uneventful - Jay saying almost nothing and simply sitting there with his hands folded in his lap.  He wasn\u2019t even looking out the window anymore, strangely enough, as if he was suddenly tired of the view.  The landing went as expected.  We descended back to the ground smoothly in the landing pod and exited the craft to be greeted by company personnel.  \n\n\u201cBEST DAY EVER!\u201d Jay exclaimed upon exiting the craft, a fake smile now plastered on his face that hadn\u2019t been there a minute before.  \n\nI had the strangest feeling\u2026 That it wasn\u2019t really Jay anymore.  Not really.  But I didn\u2019t understand why I felt that way or how that would be possible. \n\nVery soon, though, I would find out.\n\n\n*\n\nA few days later I got a phone call from his office, asking me to join him there for a meeting.  He wanted to talk about our trip to space.  His secretary told me he wanted to reminisce.    \n\nI reluctantly agreed.  \n\nAs I entered the headquarters where Jay\u2019s office was located, I couldn\u2019t help but notice an unsettling thing while waiting in the lobby.  Everyone had the same vacant look on their faces that Jay had after the impact on the spacecraft.  They all walked around quietly, moving robotically with their arms stiffly at their sides.  \n\nNormally I would have been recognized by at least a few people in the place - they would have been smiling, greeting me with applaum after our successful flight into space.  But instead of the hero\u2019s welcome I had expected, nobody was even remotely happy to see me.  They walked past me without a word or a glance. \n\nI told myself they were just busy, trying to calm myself down.  My heart was beating fast and I was tapping my foot with nervous energy as I sat in the waiting area.  \n\nThe flight was yesterday\u2019s news, I said to myself.  People had other things on their minds at this busy company.  But I didn\u2019t feel any better.  \n\nWhen the receptionist called me up to the desk a few minutes later, she greeted me in a monotone.  Her face was expressionless.  \n\n\u201cHello, Mr. Davis,\u201d she said.  \u201cJay is expecting you upstairs.  Please proceed to Elevator B.\u201d    \n\nHer eyes opened and closed but then a second set of eyes blinked beneath that, perpendicular to the ones on the outside, revealing another set of irises beneath, these ones jet black as coal.  \n\nI froze for a second, sputtering, unsure how to react.  My heart felt like it had stopped in my chest only to resume beating three times as fast.  The room was spinning slightly as I looked at the hostile eyes of those around me.  I saw everyone in the lobby had stopped what they were doing.  They were frozen, watching me.  Waiting to see what I would do.  \n\nMy leg took a step forward without conscious effort on my part, heading up towards the office.  Play it cool, my instincts said.  Don\u2019t let them know that you know.  \n\nI smiled at the receptionist and thanked her, walking towards the elevator.  The regular hustle and bustle of the main lobby resumed and people began to continue with their lives as if nothing had happened.  \n\nNever in my life had I felt as scared as I did while riding up that elevator.  Jay\u2019s office was on the top floor of the building.  There was no getting away.  What had I been thinking coming to this place?\n\nOnly one thing could possibly help me, I realized.  But I would have to be quick.  And very sneaky.  \n\nThe private elevator doors opened and I was immediately inside Jay\u2019s office.  He was standing at the window, looking out over the city.   His back was turned to me.\n\n\u201cDo you know what I love about this place?\u201d he asked without looking my way.\n\nI hesitated, but answered carefully.\n\n\u201cNo, what\u2019s that, Jay?\u201d \n\n\u201cThe creatures who run it.  You people\u2026  You\u2019re all so\u2026 Trusting.\u201d\n\nHe turned around and I saw his eyes were black as opals.  He blinked that same strange set of perpendicular eyelids and they returned to normal for an instant, then reverted back again to that awful coal-black anti-color.  \n\n\u201cHave you ever seen a video of a giant squid, deep beneath the surface of the ocean?\u201d he asked.  \n\nI nodded.  I had recently seen one such [video.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oddlyterrifying\/comments\/qnp1f3\/giant_squid_lured_in_by_a_device_simulating\/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)  It had terrified me badly.   The idea that creatures so horrifying could live in such close proximity to us seemed impossible - like sharing an apartment with a demon.  Or sharing an office with an alien. \n\n\u201cThey have captured these creatures on film, your experts.  By mimicking a photoluminescent creature deep beneath the surface, in the pitch black space down there, they can tantalize one, lure it out from the darkness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, YOUR EXPERTS?  Who are you?  What have you done to him!?  Where's Jay?\u201d\n\nHe ignored my question.  I heard the elevator door shut behind me as he began to stride towards me purposefully.  \n\n\u201cDo you know what they look like?  These giant squids?  Before they spread their tentacles outward and expand into the beautiful, deadly creatures that they are?\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t speak, could only stumble backwards, hitting the cold metal of the elevator door behind me.  \n\n\u201cThey look like bullets shot from a gun.  Flying through the ocean at impossible speeds.  They compress themselves down and fly through the water like projectiles.  Just like we do.  You want to know what we are?  We are the alpha predators of deep space.  Great White Sharks made of dark matter.  Waiting for something to come by.  Drawn in occasionally by the light before retreating into the blackness again.\u201d\n\nMy plan had completely fled my mind for an instant, but then I remembered the phone in my hand, recording everything from up my sleeve.  The camera was just poking out at the top, taking a recording of what I was seeing.  \n\n\u201cYou humans think you\u2019re so clever,\u201d he said, whipping a tentacle towards me which came from nowhere.  It snatched up my phone easily and he took it in his hand, then deleted the video I had been secretly recording a second later.  \n\n\u201cWho do you really think will believe you?  It doesn\u2019t matter what you do.  We\u2019re here now.  You saw them all downstairs.  We\u2019re taking over now.  This planet will be ours soon.  There\u2019s nothing you can do but submit, like they did.\u201d\n\nI was pressing the elevator\u2019s \u201cdown\u201d button behind me as he spoke, tentacles now ripping holes in his suit and popping out and revealing themselves like Doctor Octopus.  The thrashing limbs were dark purple, over twenty feet long, and covered in suckers which looked to contain sharp teeth within them.  \n\n\u201cTake my word for it.  Joining them is the best thing I ever did.  All you have to do is let me help you, like they helped me,\u201d it sounded like Jay\u2019s voice talking now, only it was sly and manipulative-sounding.  Still, it was the closest thing to him I had seen or heard since that day of the impact on the space shuttle.  \n\n\u201cJay, listen to me - you have to snap out of it.  You have to fight that thing!  This isn\u2019t you!\u201d\n\nHis eyes blinked sideways again, revealing that awful blackness once more.  It was like looking at a nightmare.  \n\n\u201cOh, but it is.  This is me now.  And soon you will be one of us.  Submit.  Surrender.  Give in.  Become one of the brood.\u201d\n\nA tentacle snapped outwards suddenly in my direction, whipping my hand painfully just as the elevator door opened.  I stumbled backwards into it, hitting the button for the ground floor.  \n\nJay didn\u2019t try to stop me, he just watched me go, smiling.  The tentacles retreated back into his sides and he waved to me playfully as the elevator door closed.  \n\nThe employees downstairs didn\u2019t try to stop me when I left the building.  Everyone watched silently, standing still and staring like a pack of wild dogs whose territory had been entered.  Daring me to try something. \n\nBy the time I got home I knew I didn\u2019t have much time left.  The place on my hand where the tentacle got me, it has a three-pronged hole punched into it now, like a radioactive symbol.  That\u2019s what I am, I guess.  Radioactive.  \n\nI\u2019ll hide out here, in my house, for as long as I can.  There\u2019s not much else I can do aside from telling my story and waiting for the transformation.  Maybe if I post it here he won\u2019t find a way to take it down - he certainly got rid of it everywhere else I\u2019ve tried to share this. \n\nI can feel the seeds he planted in my hand, like leeches or slugs, the things beneath my flesh are crawling, moving up my wrist, burrowing a path towards my heart, by the looks of it.  They\u2019re moving slowly but steadily in that direction.  Like a Bugs Bunny cartoon in slow motion, they\u2019re burrowing along my forearm as I type this.  I get the feeling once they reach my heart or my brain - wherever they\u2019re headed - that will be the end of my conscious thoughts.  I won\u2019t be me anymore - I\u2019ll be them.  Whatever THEY are.  \n\nThere isn\u2019t much I can do except try to warn you.  They\u2019re already here.  And they\u2019re coming for you all.  \n\nThey have a powerful leader with unlimited resources at his disposal.  \n\nBe careful of the people with the opal eyes.  \n\nWe don't have much time left.\n\nDon\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn [you.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JGcreepypastas?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n[TCC](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TheCrypticCompendium?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)","89":"When I was a child, I lived near a dead end road. Every time we would drive past it, no one ever seemed to notice how much darker the sky was down there. I remember always wondering what was at the end of a dead end road. \nMy grandparents scolded me, don\u2019t be out too late. Riding a bike on this road is dangerous, especially at night. I decided to take off, and find out for myself if the rumors were true- I had heard my family whispering at dinner, that the lonely lady that lived in the single house on the dead end road had died. I didn\u2019t think anything of it, even as a child I knew that rumors were just rumors. But as I approached the sign, I realized I had a lump in my throat and hairs standing on the back of my neck. I let my foot rest on the road as I prepared to petal down the street. I looked up, the sun was still straight above. I had plenty of time before nightfall to find out what was truly at the end of this dead end road. \n\nFor what\u2019s supposed to be a short street, it seemed like I was peddling for hours. The trees were growing taller, and I was becoming more and more nervous as I saw the dark yellow house in the distance. Everything was so quiet. No birds chirping, no horns honking. Just the sound of the wind blowing through the trees and the squeak of my rusty bike making it\u2019s way. \n\nFinally- I had arrived. The front door was wide open. I left my bike in a pile of leaves that couldn\u2019t have crunched louder when I walked to the stairs. \n\n\u201cH-hello?\u201d My voice was weak. Everything was dark. A few curtain-less windows had let some sunlight seep in. I could smell the trash that hadn\u2019t been taken out, and my nose curled up. I found myself staring at another open door, leading to the back.  \nHere, was a hidden lake. I never knew it was there. It was beautiful, the scenery of the quiet trees and the calm water reflecting the sky. Until I looked at it\u2019s center. \nThe lady was crawling out. \n\u201cHello?\u201d I called out again. I heard the cracking of her bones as she forced her head up to make eye contact with me. Her skin was decaying, her eye sockets were empty yet I could feel her staring right through me. I ran back through the house and hopped on my bike. As I pedaled back through the trees, I noticed it was pitch black. \n\u2018That\u2019s impossible,\u2019 I thought, \u2018I was only there for 5 minutes\u2019\nI pedaled as fast as my legs would allow, as I heard the wet pitter patter of her feet gaining on me. I didn\u2019t stop until I reached my grandparents house where I locked the door and looked out the window without speaking a word. \n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d \n\u201cThe dead end road.\u201d I said, as I saw a single puddle of water at the end of the driveway.","90":"\n\nKonica   Brent \n\nK\nHey, babe.\n\nB\nHey, baaaabe.\n\nK\nI'm walking.

I looked over at him, torn out of my own memories, and quietly took the glass he was holding before he dropped it.\n\nHe looked down at it in my hand and blinked back a few years.\n\n\u201cThe B block. You were all there when we went into the B block. You have to remember.\u201d He whispered. His voice sounded like sandpaper on wood.\n\nI looked at the others. Bailey, in specific. If anyone ought to remember it was him- he and Badr were twins. Joined at the hip. He was older by a few minutes, but that hadn\u2019t mattered until we\u2019d lost Mischa.\n\nBailey\u2019s expression was blank.\n\n\u201cMaybe if you jogged our memory?\u201d I suggested softly, thinking maybe Erica was right and we\u2019d repressed the whole thing.\n\nBadr took a deep breath that didn\u2019t seem to do anything to steady him.\n\n\u201cIt was right by the pool. You remember?\u201d I mutely shook my head. I assume the others did too, because he continued.\n\n\u201cThere was an old stairwell. A- um, fire escape. We stacked boxes until we could reach it. Tonya got a splinter under her nail. Edi and Kai took her home. We went all the way up to the roof. There was a door up there. Mischa dared *you* to go in.\u201d He lifted his chin and looked at his twin, something I took for resentment and grief shining in his eyes.\n\n\u201cBut there were cobwebs and you were scared of spiders, so I went instead.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not right-\u201d Bailey shook his head and smiled, I think he was relieved to have found what he thought was a hole in Badr\u2019s story, \u201c-You\u2019re the one who\u2019s scared of spiders.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot then I wasn\u2019t!\u201d Badr nearly shouted. We all shared a look. I was starting to think that maybe he\u2019d had a few too many and it was time to get him upstairs to his room, but he put his hands on the table and stood up straight. No wobble. No lean.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not drunk!\u201d He didn\u2019t sound it at the moment.\n\n\u201cYou were scared of spiders and I wasn\u2019t. I used to like spiders. Grandpa told us that spiders were house spirits that kept away the ones that cause disease and sickness. I went in first, and then you all came in after me. We had some flashlights.\u201d His breathing had slowed down by then.\n\nAnd I was starting to remember.\n\nIt came back to me in hazy images as he described trying the doors on the top floor. How all of them were locked but the one in the back at the very end of the hallway. How it opened up on a really nice apartment-\n\nAnd by then I could see it. Clear as day in my mind\u2019s eye.\n\nThe curtains were made of velvet. The heavy red stuff that you only saw in movies and theaters. The couch was too. Everything was coated in dust, but I was pretty sure- at least as a kid- that the picture frames and some of the statues were real gold. The side tables looked like genuine marble. The flower pots were full of dry stalks, but it was easy to imagine they\u2019d been ferns or flowers at some point.\n\nAll of us came from poor families. Not impoverished, but not what I would call thriving. While we HAD food, it wasn\u2019t always lots of it or very nutritious. Sometimes we only had a meal or two a day.\n\nSo looking at all that richness, I\u2019m sure the others felt exactly what I had. A pang of raw avarice.\n\nBut Badr was the one who moved first. He went for one of the paintings on the wall-\n\n\u201cI saw this painting-\u201d His voice overlaid my memory, \u201c- the frame looked like real gold, and I thought\u2026 I could take it home to my grandma and maybe she could sell it and then we would be rich-\u201d\n\nIn my memory I saw him wrap his hands around the frame and start to lift it.\n\nAnd then a milky cloud come boiling up behind it, rushing over the frame and down his hands and arms.\n\n\u201cMischa said they had to be spiders. He almost convinced me, but they weren\u2019t. They weren\u2019t spiders. I remember! They were cigarettes, Bailey. They were lit cigarette butts, and they scuttled down my arms and burned and burrowed and-\u201d He stopped speaking, maybe because he couldn\u2019t go on.\n\nI remembered though. The scent of blood and burning skin. The way he\u2019d screamed. The clap of the picture frame falling back against the wall. I remembered him staggering backwards as the tide of cigarette butts rushed under his clothes and left trails of pink and red and black behind them. Hundreds of vicious burns and gouges.\n\nHis older brother running forward and dragging him away from the wall. Mischa pulling his shirt off and forcing him into the hallway. The rest of us running after, because there were MORE and they were pouring out from behind the other picture frames and under the couch and beneath the cabinets. I remember looking *up* and realizing that there were more, bigger ones coming out of the crawl spaces in the ceiling. Bailey slammed the door shut behind us and when I looked back I could see the smoldering ends poking out beneath it. Squirming, wiggling, crushed cigarettes.\n\nMischa picked Badr up and ran up the stairs with him. Because I was the slowest, I was the last out the door and slammed IT shut too. I turned around to find Badr on the roof just screaming and writhing while Mischa and Bailey tried to get the rest of his clothes off. There was so much red. His skin was covered in it.\n\nI joined them when they took off their shoes and started slapping at the cigarettes, squashing them and knocking them off. My mind still shies away from the way the blisters burst.\n\nWe weren\u2019t getting rid of them fast enough, and Badr wasn\u2019t screaming as much or as loudly anymore. Mischa yelled something, I think it was-\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re under his skin.\u201d Bailey supplied in real time. He sounded like he\u2019d been punched in the gut. I looked up and saw the fresh tears on Badr\u2019s face as he only nodded.\n\n\u201cMischa took me down to the river.\u201d It was only on the other side of the chain link fence, but that trip had felt like a lifetime and I was sure he\u2019d be dead before we got there. Mischa had carried him right into the water and held onto him until the last of the embers seemed to have washed away and then Kai ran home to grab a change of clothes for him.\n\nWe all took him home. His grandma must\u2019ve thought he was dead- he was so limp and still bleeding in places. They called the doctor and a priest.\n\nI think one might have been more helpful than the other, because as soon as he started praying Badr kind of sighed\u2026 and a thin red mist seemed to rise from his wounds. His grandmother sent the rest of us home.\n\nWe didn\u2019t see the brothers for six whole days. Mischa and Bailey first. Badr didn\u2019t come out to play with us again for almost an entire month. Physically, he seemed to recover with only a handful of small scars.\n\nAfter that, though, he was terrified of spiders.\n\nAnd cigarettes.","92":"I'm a rather introverted person. It's not that I avoid nor despise interaction, I just prefer to keep to myself and do things my own way. This, with my love of nature and the outdoors in general, leads me to often, foolishly, venture out hikes, camping, and backpacking trips by myself. Which wouldn't be terrible if I didn't also abstained from informing anyone of my plans. 3 years an infantryman and having backpacked through the Adirondacks in winter time, you could easily say that I was cocky and far over confident in my abilities.\n\nThat all changed after I took a trip, well tried to, through some lesser traveled parts of the Rockies.\n\nI had gotten stationed at ft. Carson, and was excited for the first opportunity to take to the mountains for an extended weekend. That opportunity came when we received a four day for whatever reason, not important. I packed up my bag, about 50lbs with all the supplies I would need for three nights. I was warned during reception that if I was to go out for an extended period, a pistol is recommend as black bear and mountain lions aren't rare to run into. Heeding their warning, I also brought along my Glock 20 which gave me 15 rounds of 10mm, plenty I thought for any issues I would run into on my adventure... I thought.\n\nI drove out Wednesday night parked up in a lot and slept in my car. Woke up about 30 minutes before sunrise and started on my way. I had decided that I didn't want to see a single person my entire trip, so I, in my arrogance planned to not follow a single trail, taking only unbroken parts of every mountain I was going to summit.\n\nAs I was making my way out the parking lot, I saw a sign. \"Park is CLOSED after 6pm. No one is to remain on the mountains. Anyone found will be removed and fined.\" I saw this as the perfect chance to practice concealment in a hostile environment.\n\nThe first day I made decent progress about 12-13 miles. I was trying to get as deep as possible into the mountains to avoid an early termination of my weekend trip. Around sunset I began looking for a place to lay low. I found a decent spot to hunker down and began to create a concealed position. I wrapped it up, ate some food, and slid into my sleeping bag just before sunset.\n\nI awoke to the sounds of people trudging through the woods and saw beams of light cutting across the trees. I heard what sounded like two park rangers chatting about their days and bitching about the cold. I stayed still and silent until the noises and voices faded. Rather proud of myself, I wiggled into a more comfortable position and slept till sunrise.\n\nDawn broke, I packed, and went along my way. Following the rough path I had plotted. I covered about 8 more miles then chose a place to stay. I did my preparations and settled down for another good nights sleep. But tonight I would learn why the curfew was set.\n\nI once again woke to the noise of snapping twigs and shifting gravel. I immediately thought that it was another group of rangers, and was wondering how I could have planned my route so poorly and close to main trails that I ran into them two nights in a row. But it didn't sound like the rangers from the night before. Instead of heavy, slow, and rhythmic beating of the rangers thick soled boots, it sounded more like scampering, a pitter-patter of small feet. There were no heavy beams thrown from the powerful flashlights of the night before. And the deep irritated voices were replaced with childlike giggling and hushed whispers.\n\nInstinctively, I froze, trying to collect as much information as I could using my ears and whatever I could get with my eyes. Shadows flickered in the darkness, a crescent moon being the only light, and the giggling and whispers grew louder. The noises skittering feet seemed to be circling me now, drawing slowly closer.\n\nI sat up now, \"Hello?\" I said to the darkness. Fingering my Glock in it's holster, if training had taught me anything, it was to always sleep with your weapon. The noises stopped, not a sound a sound to be heard say for the swaying of the trees in the cold night wind. I reached for my bag and pulled out a flashlight, pointed it at the last placed I had heard a noise and flicked the switch.\n\nIlluminated in front of me was a small girl, no older than 9 or ten, naked and wearing nought but the skull of a doe as a mask. Her limbs were contorted, skewed I would say. Joint's facing directions they never should but looking completely natural. And a large jagged scar on her chest where her heart should be. I saw her for only a split second before she dove for the shelter of a tree away from my light.\n\n\"Hello? Are you okay.\" I called out to her, slowly making my way over to her, hand resting on my pistol. \"I don't want to hurt you are you lost?\" I could hear whispering echo through the woods around me. Very few lines audible\n\n\"He got gun.\"\n\n\"We still got him.\"\n\n\"They need someone. We NEED him.\"\n\n\"Give me stone\"\n\nA rock pelts me in the back and I whip around the light to catch a glimpse of a boy maybe 11, naked as well but wearing what I think is a buck skull. Limbs twisted in a similar manner.\n\n\"We're stronger, they made sure of it.\"\n\n\"We have numbers!\"\n\n\"I'll get his back.\"\n\nThe voices are unmistakably those of children. Another rock strikes me in the side of my head, larger than the last and I feel a warm trickle begin to run down my face. I draw my pistol. A volley of rocks ensues, some bigger, some smaller, all thrown with a strength uncharacteristic of any normal child around that age. I catch one in my light and snap a shot in his direction. The round rips through the eye of the skull mask, dropping the child where he stood. An enraged shriek resounds from the wood-line as the volley picks up intensity.\n\nFrantically I search for targets, but they're moving faster now and are harder to line up. Another particularity hard throw strikes me across the mouth knocking out a few teeth. I'm dazed. Thunk another rock, this time to the back of my head. I fall to my knees, dropping my flashlight and pistol. I hear one running up behind me. Clumsily I grab for my pistol, getting a hold of it and blindly firing three shot behind me. I yelp followed by the sound of a body dropping onto mountain gravel tells me i hit. Grabbing my flash light, still shaking off the impact of the two stones I reveal the figure that ran at me.\n\nBefore me was what looked like a six year old boy, a buck-skull mask adorning his head, twisted limbs and spine, and a similar scar to the girl above his heart. I had hit him in the hips once. He cried in pain clutching at the gushing wound, a large sharpened stick to his right. As I aim for a killing shot, an even larger rock with a harder throw strikes me across the temple and all goes black.","93":"I squint through the snowstorm and look down to my watch, raising it a little closer to my face for a better look, but I don\u2019t know why I bother. It\u2019s just force of habit, I guess.\n\n\u2026The watch is broken. It\u2019s always broken.\n\nI should replace it, really\u2026 after all, who wears a broken watch? \u2026I just can\u2019t bring myself to do so. It was passed down from my grandad, through my brother. Three different repair places have all turned me away and said it was impossible to fix. Too old, they say. Sounds like bullshit to me, but hey, what do I know.\n\nI shiver and my gaze returns to my surroundings; I draw my coat a little tighter around my body.\n\nThe storm rages. All around is snow and an endless world of white, illuminated through the dark with the mist-blurred orange of the endless, dutiful streetlamps.\n\nI carry on trudging along my way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the beginning of the night, right after the bus dropped me off, I considered waiting in the spot I was left behind. Waiting for the driver to realise his error and to come back and get me\u2026 but it was just too cold for standing around, so I started walking down the road- following the bus\u2019s direction of travel.\n\nIt\u2019s been a few hours now, and the bus never came back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah. Hey, my name is Sam, by the way. I\u2019m fifteen. And I\u2019m lost in the snow.\n\nI didn\u2019t realise the mistake until the bus had driven away. The storm beyond the windows was too thick\u2026 and hell, why *shouldn\u2019t* it be dropping me off in the right place? \u2026It\u2019s *always* the right place. Never, never *ever* am I dropped off in the wrong location.\n\n\u2026Except for this evening, it would seem. This, the evening of the storm.\n\nI grimace and close my eyes tight shut against a sudden barrelling gust of icy wind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no idea where I am.\n\nMaps isn\u2019t working. But I should be okay. I\u2019ll just keep following the road until I find something I recognise.\n\nSoon, for sure.\n\nAnd so I walk. I walk, and I walk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s maybe three or so hours or so until I really start to feel the first stages of panic settling in. The air only feels like it\u2019s getting colder and colder. Sharper and sharper. There\u2019s no-one at home right now to come and collect me, so what am I supposed to do? I check my phone again as the battery steadily drops. The device shakes in my shivering hand.\n\n\u201cCome on\u201d, I mutter, grimacing. Looking around for a countless time. \u201cCome on. Give me something here. Something\u201d.\n\nAnd if I squint\u2026 if I squint just right\u2026 There, through the blizzard, is a different kind of light.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFaint at first, and paler than the orange of the streetlamps\u2026 but it\u2019s different enough. Distinct. Yellow and soft, spilling through the windows of a long building, a little ways back from the road.\n\nIt could be an office-block, or something? I decide to go for it, turning away from the road and trudging a path through the fallen snow to the building\u2019s entrance.\n\nAs I approach I realise that the building isn\u2019t an office at all, in fact.\n\nIt\u2019s a school.\n\nNot mine, nor one that I recognise, but a school nonetheless.\n\n\u201cDamn\u2026 it\u2019s probably locked up tight\u201d, I think aloud as I reach the front doors, but to my surprise they push right open at my touch, and so I head on inside.\n\nIt\u2019s not particularly warm in here, but hey at least it\u2019s out of the wind and the snow. My footsteps echo on the hard floor, the door closes with a thunk behind me and the sounds of the weather are dulled.\n\nI draw down my hood and allow myself a breath. It fogs and clouds out into the surrounding airs and I look around.\n\nThe school\u2019s main lobby is illuminated like two of its off-shooting corridors: with a faint, warning yellow.\n\nThe light in corridor three is flickering silently, and the light of the fourth is non-existent. Dead dark and a picture of shadows. An unfamiliar emblem is emblazoned on the wall to my left, above the motto: *\u2018Ad mortem. Ad lucem\u2019.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA disturbing sense of unease passes through me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe light flickers, and the air chills.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI try to clear my throat- but the noise sounds distant and far away\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy breath clouds around my face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2026And a shadow, vast and long, swims into my field of vision across the walls and floor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSlowly, as if beneath a body of water, I turn my head. I turn to look behind me and stagger away in horror, as fast as this newly thickened air will allow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeyond the glass of the entrance doors and drifting through the snow and shadows in the air is a living nightmare. What appears, bizarrely, to be something akin to an enormous eel; black and creeping, slithering its way through the evening air as if the storm were the bottom of the sea. Its jaw cracks open a slither- and as it passes me by I see its teeth: grey and spiked and beyond count. Its eye fixes upon mine. It glows like the lights of the school. Yellow, only brighter. The pupil of this great eel is rectangular, in the manner of a goat\u2019s, and deeper and darker and blacker than anything I\u2019ve ever seen. To meet this thing\u2019s stare is to look back into the eye of the abyss.\n\nIt drifts past the door at a right angle, its long and snake-like body following on behind, and I tear away my eyes.\n\n\u201cFuck\u201d, I stutter uselessly, \u201cfuck, no!\u201d and I turn tail and run. Away from the doors and deeper into the building. I pass by a window to my right and see in my peripheral another dark shadow, a second of these creatures, perhaps, as it swims through the snowstorm outside.\n\n\u201cWhat the hell is HAPPENING!?\u201d I shout out loud, hoping to break through the sounds of my breathing and my beating heart as I tear down the hall and round corner after corner.\n\nI find myself drawn to an ascending staircase, and so up I climb, after a quick check over my shoulder.\n\nI don\u2019t think the creatures can enter into the building\u2026 But\u2026 the flickering lights and the dancing shadows are playing tricks on me. I climb as quickly as I am able and crash down into the nearest classroom, fumbling and stumbling amongst the chairs and landing on the ground in the dark.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI catch my breath.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only light comes through the glass in the classroom door, and through the long wide window beside me. The blinds are open, and the snowstorm rages beyond. The light of a streetlamp, faint and far as it is, filters calmly inside. It illuminates the tips and edges of the chairs and tables. It casts a glossy reflective shine across the artwork, presumably drawn and painted by students, hung on the walls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2026And across the hair of the *girl*, resting casually on the counter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cHey\u201d, she says, with a smile, and I recoil in surprise.\n\n\u201cWhat the- who are *you?*\u201d I ask, stuttering.\n\n\u201cSorry about the eels... They\u2019re here for me, not for you, but best to avoid them all the same\u201d. She says, dodging the question and brushing a strand of hair from her face. She tucks it behind her ear.\n\nI realise that at some point I have bitten my lip, and it throbs painfully. I rub a thumb across the freshly forming bump. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I ask, \u201cwhat are you doing here? Are we safe?\u201d\n\nShe shrugs. \u201cPretty safe, I guess. For now\u201d. She glances to the window, and gently kicks her heels against the counter. \u201cMy name is Ellie. I\u2019m just hanging out. Do you have a name?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I have a name\u201d, I reply, irritated. \u201cIt\u2019s Sam. Is this, geez, is this your school then?\u201d\n\nShe shrugs again. \u201cKinda\u201d.\n\n*Kinda..?*\n\nI glance from the door to the window and clamber up to my feet, taking a seat opposite her on a nearby desk. My dumb teenage brain tries to work out if she\u2019s cute or not. She kind of is, I guess. More importantly though I\u2019m also trying to decide if her presence here has heightened or lessened the imminent danger.\n\n\u201cCould you just, stop screwing around for a second? What the fuck is going on? \u2026Eels? Massive eels in the snow?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t actually eels, obviously, That would be moronic. They just look like eels\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo what *are* they then? Why are they hanging around here? Around your school?\u201d\n\nShe shifts, and brings a hand up to her shoulder to rub her arm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not really your problem\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot my PROBLEM?\u201d I repeat, eyebrows furrowed. \u201cUh, well I would disagree a little!\u201d I throw out my hands. \u201cWhat is HAPPENING?\u201d\n\nHer tone shifts to a defensive one. \u201cJeez if you\u2019re gonna be a whiny little *bitch* you can just GO, okay? I didn\u2019t ask for you to come here! I already told you, they aren\u2019t here for you. They\u2019re here for *me!*\u201d Ellie crosses her arm and stands up from the desk, turning and walking away to face the window.\n\n*Whiny little bitch!?*\n\n\u2026Oof.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe both watch as the enormous shadow of one of the creatures drifts past the glass, temporarily throwing a coat of shadow across the room.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe snow falls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Diplomacy, Sam.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI rub my chin. I want answers here.\n\n\u201cAlright\u201d, I say. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. She turns back to look at me, and I speak on:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just freaked out, okay? You seem a lot more in control of the situation. I\u2019d like to be at the same level you are\u201d. I hold out my hand, an offer for her to shake it, a peace offering, and my grandfather\u2019s watch catches in the light.\n\nHer eyes dart to it at once and her expression changes completely. She squeals a little and puts her face right close to it. \u201cThat is GORGEOUS!\u201d she says, \u201coh my goodness, where did you get this? Can I see it?\u201d\n\n*Why is she not concerned by the monsters outside\u2026?*\n\n\u201cUh, yeah\u2026 sure, here, take it\u201d. I unclasp it from my wrist and make to hand it to her, but she takes a sudden step back.\n\n\u201cOh, no, it\u2019s okay. If you could just set it down on the table that would be great\u201d.\n\nI pause.\n\n\u201cYou want me to just\u2026 set it down on the table?\u201d\n\nShe nods and smiles pleasantly. \u201cMm-hmm\u201d.\n\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d I do as she asks, and instead of passing the watch directly to her I instead place it gently down on the nearest desk. She rests on its surface, one hand on either side of the timepiece, and gets her face really close to it.\n\n\u201cYou were wearing it on the wrong wrist, you know\u201d, she says as she studies the thing.\n\nI shrug again, irritated. \u201cWell, I\u2019m left-handed, so\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t work?\u201d she asks me. \u201cIt\u2019s broken\u2026? Why would you wear a broken watch?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven a broken watch is right twice a day\u201d, I reply drily, and to my surprise she actually laughs.\n\nI chuckle too, a little awkwardly in surprise.\n\n\u201cSure\u201d, she says, sticking out her tongue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe shadow of the eel drifts past the window. Again we are cast in shadow as it passes us by, swimming through the rush of the storm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cPlease just tell me what\u2019s going on, alright?\u201d I say to her, my temporarily-misplaced fear returning at full force. \u201cCome on, don\u2019t play around with me. Are we *actually* in danger? I certainly *feel* in danger\u2026\u201d\n\nShe ignores me, squinting carefully at the broken watch, muttering quietly in thought to herself. \u201cTime\u2026\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a funny thing\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I say, \u201cHey enough is enough!\u201d and I step forward; I reach out to grab her arm\u2026\n\n\u2026But in my attempt, my hand passes right through her skin.\n\nHer skin and body and everything else. She is mass-less, and I watch as my hand passes effortlessly right through her arm, translucent and flickering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a moment of processing, I take a silent and horrified step back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe sighs and straightens, brushing that same strand of hair behind her ear. She no longer looks as solid, or indeed as grounded as she did mere moments ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you ended up here tonight\u201d, she says quietly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe wind whistles beyond the walls.\n\nAnd the snowstorm rages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\[Part 2\\]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qr5i9i\/lost_in_a_snowstorm_i_have_stumbled_into_an\/)","94":"I visited the relatives of my mother in Sikkim last winter and only once had I left the United States, therefore I was thrilled to explore the new sights of my family's homeland. My family had done a variety of tourist things in Gangtok and we had a day out to Zemu Glacier a few hours from Gangtok at the conclusion of the trip.\n\nMy uncle was a helicopter pilot and by pulling a few strings, he could fly my family over the glacier and he said that he could take us to the most isolated parts of the glacier. For a couple of hours we rode around and landed sometimes to get out and stroll about. It was the morning when we landed on a rather uneven area of jagged ice with mountains surrounding us on all sides. For many hours we were walking on the ice, so I was dumbly assuming I knew what I was doing and went out ahead of the family.\n\nIronically it was only a few metres that my right leg fell through the snow, and I threatened to grasp it with my hands, but my whole body went right through the fracture in the ice. Before I knew it, I was free falling with ice speeding at my side until I eventually stopped at the base of the crevasse.\n\nThe landing had me instantly winded and after a few dazed moments trying to regain my breath, I finally stumbled to my feet and only looked around to see the blackness surrounding me. The only light that I could see came down through the hole in the ceiling above me. From the bottom of the crevasse, I shouted out to my family, but heard nothing back. I thought that was rather strange, since they were behind me and I assumed they had seen me fall. The crevasse was deathly black and to combat the darkness, I grabbed out my phone, which had miraculously survived the fall, to use it as light.\n\nAgain I screamed as loudly as I was able to, but I heard nothing back from the crack above me, it seemed my family hadn\u2019t seen me fall. My thoughts were rushing, It would have been a few hours before a helicopter could fly from Gangtok for assistance and then still longer for them to descend the crevasse. In addition, who knew just how much of the entry was blocked.\n\nWhat I was wearing, I peered down. It was October, so I simply had a light jacket and fine gloves. But the longer I stood, the more the air grew colder and I could swear I could feel the frostbite beginning. As I investigated my surroundings, I began to realise the distance I feel and I believed I should have plummeted at least 40 metres.\n\nAfter another few minutes I eventually became so anxious to find a way out, to my luck I saw a hole across from me that was just barely higher than me, it was my only hope. But my gloved fingers slipped on the ice as I tried pulling my way up, I squirmed and lifted my arms over the holes lip, finally I managed to push my top torso and my legs onto the lip of the hole.\n\nAs I brushed off the ice, I flashed my phone around me and found a tunnel jutting off from the hole, large ice chunks and snow coated the floor in a thick carpet. To add even more mystery, A maze of ice walls emerged from the tunnel, which I can only characterize as leading all over the glacier.\n\nRegardless, I had to find a way back up to the surface.\n\nSomewhere ahead of me, I heard a loud rumbling, it was a sound I had heard before and Uncle told me that it was the ice shifting. As I stood still, I froze and listened intently to the rumbling and I contemplated turning around and going back, but in the end, I chose to continue on. I may freeze to death if the ice moves, blocking my way, but I had to give it a try.\n\nIt was only a few metres walking into the maze that I came across a startling sight.\n\nA chamber of ice greeted me as I entered, Icicles encircled the upper walls of the circular structure and with my mouth agape I looked around the room. A concave, almost nest-like pillar sat in the centre of the room, and I stepped up to it to see. On the interior, there was a thick layer of snow covering the surface and it reeked of rotting meat.\n\nI turned around and slowly walked back to the maze, where I had left off earlier. So, when I entered a tunnel that curled upwards, I sprinted. This time around, I was trying to stay focused and avoid slipping when I heard it.\n\nAs I looked up and forward, I heard the same loud rumbling, but this time it formed a guttural growl.\n\nMy eyes were drawn to the dazzling light at the end of the tunnel when I saw a tall being standing in front of it, but the weird thing was that the being was made of pure ice and some rays of light behind it pierced through. In a way it looked like a man made of icicles and toward the top of its body, two blue orbs gazed at me.\n\nThe icicle being hovering above the ice and in the silence of the glacier, the being emitted a slight ringing, much similar to a Wind chime. In an instant, the icicle levitated down the tunnel at me and I immediately bolted the other way, trying not to slip as I sprinted. It took me a while to find my way out of the ice maze, but eventually I found the narrowest passage I could, I thought that the creature wouldn't be able to get through.\n\nI could hear the thing wandering around producing the same deep sound that I had heard earlier, Until I couldn't hear it anymore when I went into the smaller passageways to hide.\n\nFollowing an hour of silence, I began going back towards where I'd fallen from the surface. By some miracle, I ended up in the original tunnel from before and I made my way out as silently as possible. In the crevasse where I had begun, I dropped and gazed at the tunnel in hope that it was too tiny for whatever I had just seen to fit through.\n\nBut as I turned to return back to my original position, I heard a deep rumbling behind me and I dared not turn around to see what was there, for in the ice in front of me I could see [the beast's ice blue eyes staring right at me.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ylodeckard\/)","95":"I barely noticed the letter peeking out of the stack of bills.

If the water makes any contact with your skin immediately contact your supervisor.*\n\n*Near the building of the facility there is a guard shack. This is where you are to spend the majority of your time. If you need to contact your supervisor there is a phone. There is also a cabinet of tools in case your work requires it.*\n\n*Upon arriving at work you are to:*\n\n*1) Ensure the door to the facility is not obstructed in any way.*\n\n*If any items have been placed in front of the facility, remove them.

Whilst I could make out the street names that hugged the edge of the forest, everything beyond the initial grouping of trees was blacked out with a marker.\n\nThe rules and description of the job raised additional questions, but my eyes remained locked on the promise of a salary. That night I went to sleep early; excited about the chance at a life that doesn\u2019t involve regular visits to the Ministry of Labor.\n\nAs I found myself drifting off, however, an odd phrase crept into my mind:\n\n*\u0492\u044b\u043b\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u049b\u043e\u043d\u0434\u044b\u0440\u0493\u044b.*\n\nThe building formerly known as the People\u2019s Institute of Science was occasionally referred to by that name, but that name would only be uttered in the most select of paranoid circles. The institute was only called *\u0492\u044b\u043b\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u049b\u043e\u043d\u0434\u044b\u0440\u0493\u044b* in old wives\u2019 tales to terrify children and by grizzled drunks who\u2019s grasp on reality had slipped beyond help.\n\nBack when the Soviets still ruled the country the People\u2019s Institute of Science was a research facility. That was all that was known of it. Somewhere around the early 2000s there was hushed news of Russian soldiers traveling into the woods, but that information seemed to be more connected to the constant speculation about the institute rather than any factual evidence. Whenever the institute was mentioned people spoke of forbidden knowledge and vengeful spirits, but I\u2019ve never considered myself particularly superstitious.\n\nFor a moment the thought of the stories behind *\u0492\u044b\u043b\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u049b\u043e\u043d\u0434\u044b\u0440\u0493\u044b* stirred me in my bed. Even thinking of the name disturbed me\u2014 yet, soon enough, memories of the Ministry of Labor washed out the thoughts of abandoned science facilities.\n\nEvery two weeks I was required to appear at the ministry to reiterate my inability to find work. Every two weeks I had to meet with the same angry clerk. The man had a very peculiar mole right above his mouth. Whenever he would berate me the strange piece of flesh would bounce above his lip like a destructive basketball trapped in an office.\n\nWith hopes of never visiting the Ministry of Labor again, I drifted off to sleep.\n\nLast Christmas my mother bought me a thermos and a sandwich-press. When I left the house for my new job the air had sharp cold teeth, yet the hot thermos and freshly toasted ham and cheese sandwich provided me warmth. That warmth slowly grew into a need to call my mother; to tell her about my new job, to thank her for her gifts and care, yet by the time I picked up my phone I was out of signal range.\n\nThe forest had no coverage. Even if there was signal I would have to wait for my mother to call me back. My phone has long been without credit. All that I can use it for is sending call requests, accepting calls and bulk-loading reddit posts off of my neighbor\u2019s wi-fi.\n\nI made a mental note to call my mother after my first shift and kept on walking through the forest. Even though each breath of the frigid air pained my lungs, there was a semblance of tranquility in the woods. Aside from my footsteps on the leaves and the occasional crackling twigs, the universe was completely silent. No birds, no wind, no wildlife; just the forest and me.\n\nThen a screaming foreigner ran down the forest path.\n\nThe man wore a heavy motorcycle jacket and would have looked intimidating in the dim lighting of a roadside bar, yet in the middle of the forest he looked utterly absurd. I didn\u2019t understand a word that he was yelling at me, but that didn\u2019t dissuade him from screaming even louder.\n\nFor a couple minutes I tried to figure out if he needed something, if he was lost or hurt, but it quickly became apparent that our language-gap couldn\u2019t be crossed on a timer. Not wanting to be late for my first day at work, I pointed out the way to the nearest road and bid the man goodbye.\n\nSure, the right thing would have been to make sure the guy was alright, but I wanted to make a good first impression at my new job. I wanted to keep my new job.\n\nFor a moment the lush green forest around me started to trouble me. Was I going in the right direction? The forest just seemed like a regular forest, no change in the foliage and no Soviet science facility in sight. I checked the time on my phone every two minutes.\n\nBut then, my mind calmed. The trees in front of me started to grow sickly. The bushes shed their leaves and turned into tortured wooden grasps. Soon enough the forest around me turned gray and dead. *The foliage around the facility is quite distinctive.* I was on the right track.\n\nThe trees grew progressively thinner and bent until there were none at all. It was as if the big cement block that lay in front of me had seeped out every ounce of life from the land around it. The building that was formerly known as the People\u2019s Institute of Science stuck out of the dead earth as if it was a tombstone for an inhuman corpse. Like a metallic crown of lenses, a mess of spotlights sat on top of the institute. The eyes of the electric lanterns were dim, but I felt as if they were all looking at me.\n\nNearby was the guard shack the letter had mentioned.\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief. It was exactly 07:00.\n\nI confidently walked into the shack, prepared to make a good impression on my supervisor. Yet the shack was empty. I was alone.\n\nFor a couple minutes I waited by the phone, expecting some sort of a phone call to make sure I\u2019m at work, but when none came I decided to do the actual work I was being paid for.\n\nJust as the letter had said, there was a ditch filled with water surrounding the building of the institute. The moat stank of old socks and something seemed to be moving in the water, but it was easy enough to jump over and ignore.\n\nI took a walk around the concrete block and didn\u2019t find any vagrants, dead or alive.\n\nThe big double door to the facility, however, had a metal lock in it. The thing was clapped on tight, but the bolt cutters in the tool cabinet made quick work of the fixture.\n\nI walked a couple more circles around the facility to check for vagrants and then I went into the guard shack. It was 16:40. I still had nearly seven hours of doing nothing until midnight. I started to search the shack for the supervisor\u2019s number, just so I would be prepared if the need arose.\n\nI did not find it. After closer inspection, however, I realized the number wouldn\u2019t be of much use anyway. The phone had no dial pad; it was just a black box with a receiver. Out of curiosity, I picked up the phone.\n\n\u201cWhat is the nature of your emergency?\u201d a female voice strained through static asked.\n\nI explained there was no emergency and introduced myself. A couple seconds into my introduction the voice cut me off.\n\n\u201cMonitor the facility grounds until you hear the siren. Only contact your supervisor in case of emergency or to verify documents.\u201d\n\nThen she hung up.\n\nThe receiver did not go silent however, a strange electric hiss started to grow on the other side. It was as if the static itself was trying to repeat the woman\u2019s words, as if the strange misfires of circuitry were trying to achieve sentience.\n\nI hung up the phone. It was making me feel uncomfortable.\n\nI spent a good chunk of time staring at the open field of the institute. The stillness, the silence; it was all sort of calming. But then I got bored. By the time the sun set and the spotlights of the institute lit up, my phone battery was already at 50%.\n\nI was hopping back and forth between browsing through interesting AskReddit threads and gazing out at the cement structure. The things on my phone were interesting to read, but looking out at that perfectly square construction in the woods, sensing the way the light fixtures slowly followed me through the shack, it was all quite hypnotic.\n\nMy job was tranquil and the promised pay was good. As I sat in the shack I found myself drifting off to daydreams. I was never going to see the clerk with the mole again. I could pay off all my debts. I could date. In my mind a new future was starting to manifest.\n\nThe siren quickly chased it out.\n\nThe shrill sound coming from the wall startled me, but I got into position as quickly as I could. I placed my chair against the window and stared at the wall. I would do as the letter told me to do\u2014 keep my eyes to myself and just read out the documents.\n\nThe siren eventually quieted down into a low buzz. The lights on the facility went dim. Only the small light in my shack kept the darkness at bay. Outside staggered footsteps approached.\n\nI hoped that I could strike up some conversation with the members of the midnight shift and maybe better my chances of securing steady employment, but these people did not speak. They simply passed me their documents through the window slot and ignored any of my small talk.\n\nI did as I was told. The documents I was passed were simple enough to understand. All that was present was a name, a badge number and a picture. These were definitely scientist types. They all wore glasses.\n\nI read their names and badge numbers into the phone, one by one. The supervisor grunted in response to each name.\n\n\u201cDr. Nikolski, badge number so and so.\u201d *Grunt.*\n\n\u201cDr. Krymsky, badge number so and so.\u201d *Grunt.*\n\n\u201cDr. Nowak, badge number so and so.\u201d *Grunt.*\n\nOnce no new badges were presented the siren picked up again. I shouted into the phone, asking the supervisor if there was something else I was meant to do.\n\n\u201cHas Dr. V\u00edtek appeared?\u201d the voice asked.\n\nI told her I didn\u2019t know, but that I could ask the midnight crew.\n\n\u201cYou are to not look at or communicate with any of the employees. Remain seated until the siren ends and then go back to monitoring the grounds.\u201d\n\nShe hung up. I quickly put the phone down before that horrid static started up again.\n\nThe siren dragged on into the night, and it didn\u2019t make for pleasant company, but when it finally quieted down I found myself appreciating the calmness of my new job even more.\n\nThe lights on top of the facility did not turn on after the siren went quiet, but there was plenty of moonlight to convince me that no one was sneaking around the grounds. The metal double door of the building was shut.\n\nIt was a couple minutes after midnight.\n\nI finished reading the rest of the posts I had saved up on my phone and ate the sandwich I was too nervous to eat before. I kept the last 5% of my phone battery to tell the time. As soon as the digital clock struck 04:00 I was out of the shack and on my way back.\n\nBy the time I got back home there was an envelope in my mailbox. 15,000 tenge. No additional letter.\n\nI counted and recounted the money for longer than I would care to admit and then I called my mother. She has always been quite superstitious so I simply told her I was hired as a groundskeeper at a government facility and skipped any specifics. Even without details she was overjoyed that I had found some form of employment.\n\nAfter I got off the phone with her I counted the money one more time and then passed out.\n\nMy next shift contained no vagrants, locks or corpses. I simply got paid to show up and stare at an empty field and read some name badges for a grunting supervisor.\n\nDr. V\u00edtek didn\u2019t show up that night, or on any of the other nights, yet every shift the supervisor still asks about him.\n\nAt first I was happy about the money, about the possibility of digging myself out of debt, but after a couple of shifts at the building that was formerly known as the People\u2019s Institute of Science I have found myself troubled.\n\nThere\u2019s a part of me that is curious about what is on the other side of that door.\n\nDid I wonder what happens inside of the institute on the first night? Obviously. As satisfied as I was in that shack, the temptation of the unknown called to me. My mind filled with various explanations for the different rules the letter dictated. I found myself thinking back to the scary stories around the campfire, trying to figure out what tales about the *\u0492\u044b\u043b\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u049b\u043e\u043d\u0434\u044b\u0440\u0493\u044b* could actually be real. But I let go of those thoughts quickly.\n\nEven thinking of that horrible name gave me Goosebumps, but more importantly, I knew what was on the other side of that door:\n\nThe clerk with the strange mole.\n\nSitting in that shack I knew that if I was to open that door I would also be opening the door to getting fired, to having to spend countless hours filling up forms at the Ministry of Labour.\n\nThe door was guarded by the clerk on the first night, he stood there, reminding me what would happen if I disobeyed my faceless employer. The clerk\u2019s specter has kept me away on the first night, yet my memories of him are starting to fade.\n\nAfter a week of working at the building formerly known as the People\u2019s Institute of Science I barely remember what the clerk looks like.\n\nI can still resist it. I can still ignore the strangeness that surrounds my job. Yet I fear that one day, one day soon, I might fall to temptation and look inside of the building*.*\n\nI fear I might look inside and not like what I find.\n\nI fear all of those stories I heard about *\u0492\u044b\u043b\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u049b\u043e\u043d\u0434\u044b\u0440\u0493\u044b* are [true](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MJLPresents\/comments\/q2qjz1\/%D2%93%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BC%D0%B8_%D2%9B%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D2%93%D1%8B\/).","96":"((August 2021))\n\nEmergency Operations, Digital Call Log 1\nWittacur County\nAudio Transcription \n11:02pm - 11:47pm\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOperator > \u201c911, what is your emergenc-\u201c\n(..cutoff by caller)\n\nCaller > \u201cThere\u2019s someone outside my driveway, standing on the curb.

As you can imagine, when I was first assigned by US intelligence to monitor the paranormal online, I obviously stayed away from stories that were posted in places meant for fiction. It would just be silly to investigate the stories that people explicitly make up. But what if they weren\u2019t made up? In this case we\u2019ll see fiction turn into reality, and one man\u2019s dreams turn into a whole town\u2019s nightmare:\n\n\nIt begins with a story posted by a now deleted account on a now closed short fiction subreddit entitled \u201cDreamweaver\u201d:\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had nightmares since I was a kid. The kind that keep you up all night. Creepies and crawlies, ghosts and ghoulies, these were the things that awaited me every night. When I was a teenager everything started to change, I grew bigger and stronger, and in my dreams I became bigger and stronger. I could stand up for myself. Tell the monsters to go away and leave me alone. Soon there were no more creepies and crawlies. Soon I became the creepy and the crawly. \n\n\nAt school I would be picked on and bullied, but at night I could pick on and bully back. The mean kids would cower in fear as I did to them what they did to me. It felt good. It felt great. It felt like I had all the power in the world. \n\n\nEventually the bullies faded away as I became an adult. I got a job. I got a boss. I hated my boss. I hated him so much, and soon I hated the fact that he would show up in my dreams. No, that\u2019s not quite correct. He didn\u2019t show up in my dreams so much as I dreamt his dreams for him. Every night I would find myself in his body, seeing whatever shadows and sunshine his mind decided to produce. At first I was just a passive observer, soon I started to change things. No longer were his dreams about tropical vacations and big promotions, now they were about monsters, and things lurking in the night. \n\n\nOne day he was really mean, he yelled at me for half an hour for something that wasn\u2019t even my fault. I was so mad that that night I put all my energy into his nightmare. This time I wouldn\u2019t torment him with something so abstract, this time it would be something real. He got to dream that night of his wife divorcing him, taking their kids and running off to somewhere across the country. It was a good night, for me at least.\n\n\nThe next day my boss came in, whisky hanging on his breath while his head hung between his hands, hovering just above his desk. Halfway through the day he came up to me and told me that he was leaving, I asked why, and after swallowing his pride, he told me that he woke up to an empty house, save for a note from his wife telling him that she was leaving with the kids and would never come back. I was floored. I was thrilled. I knew it was no coincidence, I knew that I did this to him, and I knew that I could do it again. For I am the Dreamweaver, and whatever dream I weave can turn your life into a living nightmare.\u201d\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe story didn\u2019t gain much traction, but that didn\u2019t deter the OP, for a week later he produced the next instalment: Dreamweaver Part 2:\n\n\n\u201cMy old bully appeared today. He\u2019s a cop now. A mean cop. He pulled me over for going 5 over the limit and gave me a ticket, laughing about how I was as big a loser as ever. But he doesn\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t know that I am the Dreamweaver. He doesn\u2019t know that the anger he\u2019s given me will poison his dreams tonight, and his world tomorrow. \n\n\nThat night I dreamt of a terrible scene. A drug deal being busted. A wanted felon who can\u2019t afford to get caught. The bullet rips through Bully\u2019s leg, shattering it into a million pieces. He cries in pain. It\u2019s music to my ears.\n\n\nThe next day something ripples through the town, a collective unease that is not put into words. Not until that night when the local news broadcasts that a cop was killed that morning. I was careless. I was clueless. I did not realize that the bullet would rip his artery just like his bones. Too much blood was gone by the time the ambulance showed up. They were looking for who did it. But I did it. I killed a man. I should have been strangled by my guilt. I felt joy. I felt elation. I could not only ruin a life, I could end one too. I am the Dreamweaver, and whatever dream I weave may just be your last.\u201d\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nThree weeks passed, then came Dreamweaver Part 3:\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never liked school, I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve never liked children, I don\u2019t know why. Yet every day they pass by on their stupid yellow bus. Yet every day they yell and scream at the nearby playground. And every day my annoyance grows. I don\u2019t know why. I had no real reason. Yet I did it. Yet I did it.\n\n\nThe valley just outside of town is vast and steep. The valley outside of town is horrifically deep. The road barely has a barricade. The road barely has a barricade. The yelling and screaming children fill my dream, laughing with glee. Suddenly the yelling and screaming stops as the bus doesn\u2019t make the turn. Then the yelling and screaming starts up again, louder and terrifying. Then it stops again.\n\n\nThis time I didn\u2019t have to wait for the local news at 6, it dominated the airwaves all day. 48 children, all in the hands of a bus driver who chose the worst time to have a heart attack. No survivors. No survivors. I laughed. I laughed. While the whole town weeped I could only laugh. For I am the Dreamweaver and I can end dreams as easily as I create them.\u201d\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFollowing a tragic bus crash in Montana, local law enforcement found these stories, and while they concluded that they were just the ramblings of a crazy local who spent too much time reading the news, the stories did eventually find their way into my hands. While I was looking them over I found one final story posted, Dreamweaver Part 4:\n\n\n\u201cThey found me today. On the way home from work they caught up to me. The men in the black suits with the red ties. They were scared of me. I saw the way their hands trembled. I heard the way their voices cracked. They took me down a back road. No one around for miles. They put a gun against my head. They put a gun against my head. They opened a suitcase full of money. The choice was mine. They said. The choice was mine. They said.\n\n\nFor. They said. I was the Dreamweaver, and with the dreams I weave I could make the dreams of my country come true. I could dream away dictators and despots. I could dream away the radical left and extreme right. I could dream consent and I could dream condemnation. I could do all this. Or I could refuse and feel the hot lead make me dream my last. They were scared of me. I was scared of them. Together we could weave dreams forever. \n\n\nFor I am the Dreamweaver and I shall weave the world into a beautiful tapestry.\u201d\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNow, hard as it may be to believe, I do try to remain skeptical. You obviously don\u2019t want to waste the government's time on wild goose chases, and, I mean, it certainly makes it easier to sleep at night. I definitely didn\u2019t want to entertain the idea that someone had both the power to send a busload of children off a cliff, and lacked enough conscience to actually do it. However, for the sake of thoroughness, I put in a request to investigate the man behind these stories and make sure he was just a nutjob. However, the response I got from the agency was deeply unsettling \u2013 it simply said that he was already in contact with the agency, that I should close my case file, and any attempt to find out more about him could lead to \u201cpunitive actions\u201d.\n\n\nSo I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s all I have on this one for you. I think about this case a lot, I\u2019m not going to lie. Every time I watch the news and some elected official suffers a tragic accident, some election is won by a few last minute voters, and whenever I have a nightmare that feels just a little too real, I think about the Dreamweaver and a chill runs down my spine. \n\n[x](https:\/\/www.lairofmysteriouspowers.com\/)","98":"[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qouqlw\/the_sun_never_rises_in_emerald_bay_part_1\/)\n\n[Part 2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qpkuva\/the_sun_never_rises_in_emerald_bay_part_2\/)\n\nThe woods were dark, large trees drowned out the moonlight and yet it was always bright enough for me to see my surroundings. The eery silence had returned once more, all I could here were dry leaves and twigs breaking under my feet. The fairytale had mentioned beasts who hunted the girl through the forest and I sure hoped the story wasn't to be taken literally.\n\nThe prospect of finding Dia was all that kept me on my feet. At least my headache slowly faded and therefor, no lasting damage seemed to be done by the gunshot. It still scared me to no end that I had survived a fatal wound without any consequences, but at the moment I was simply grateful. I had no time for anything that slowed me down.\n\nI didn't have to walk far until I reached the hunter's cabin. The place where my little nightmare journey had begun. Dim lights were visible through the windows and I contemplated walking in and visiting him. I approached a window. The formerly warm and welcoming house was cold now, the temperature seemed to drop as I got closer and I shivered.\n\nThrough the window, I saw the hunter's body. Pale and lifeless, his shotgun on the desk in front of him. His eyes were rigid as he stared straight ahead. Unmoving.\n\nDead.\n\nI forced myself to blink the tears away. The man who had saved me in the woods, who had given me a place to rest and a weapon to defend myself, had died. I felt nauseous. The lights grew dimmer and dimmer inside the cabin. I wanted to say something, some sort of last words, an apology, a goodbye, but the words were stuck in my throat.\n\nI turned around and faced the human eyed owl again.\n\nIt sat on the ground in front of me and we stared at each other for a moment in complete silence. The lights went out behind me. There was nothing left to do here; I had to continue my way towards the wizard, find Dia and go home. That was all the reason I had left.\n\nI ignored the owl and walked deeper into the forest. The shadows grew darker, the freezing wind tugged on my clothes, I held onto my gun like my life depended on it. Part of me expected a monster to emerge from the darkness, to find myself staring into glowing eyes and being torn apart by sharp teeth and claws and yet, I couldn't bring myself to fear the dark. It was all too familiar to me to be afraid of it. I remembered how the shadows numbed the pain of the gunshot, how they had been there at the beginning, when I had woken up. How they had drowned out the heat, the fire, the lightning.\n\nIt was a faded, broken memory \u2013 shadows devouring the blinding light, replacing the agonizing heat with their cold.\n\nThere wasn't a lot I remembered. A car. A faded sunrise. A beautiful wedding ring with a blue crystal. Dia. Her wedding dress. *You're perfect, Kayla.*\n\nFire. Lightning. Darkness.\n\nThe wind should freeze my skin and yet I welcomed the chill.\n\nI walked for a while, always straight ahead, and the owl followed me. For a long time, my surroundings didn't change, but I never slowed down, never changed my direction, just walked on and on until I finally reached something that marked my progress.\n\nA car.\n\nThe remains of a police car in the middle of a dirt road, crashed and burnt out, the writing barely visible on the side. I figured it had belonged to the dead policeman I had found in Emerald Bay.\n\nAt least I was making progress.\n\nI paid little attention to the car, just crossed the road and continued my way. The owl stayed by my side and contrary to my expectations, no beast ever came for me.\n\nIt took forever to leave the forest behind and at the same time, I felt like no time had passed at all, but at some point the trees disappeared. I stepped onto an open field and found my theory confirmed \u2013 the fairytale was true. In front of me lay a graveyard. I took a deep breath, braced myself for whatever abominations would await me there and stepped between the graves. The tombstones continued endlessly left and right of me, each one was black and apparently empty. No name, no dates. No flowers.\n\nI lit one of my matches and carried it carefully in front of me, as if that would keep the spirits away. Wet grass brushed my legs, the cries of ravens or crows echoed over the field yet no bird was to be seen. The heat the small flame radiated clashed with the cool night air and its light burnt in my eyes. I looked around me, gun in my hand, ready to shoot whatever would attack me, but I seemed to be entirely alone. The cemetary was abandoned. Every bird cry in the distance made me jump a little. I quickened my pace until I was almost running.\n\nA gust of wind blew the match out and I jumped as darkness closed in around me again.\n\nThe full moon illuminated the graves and it didn't strain my eyes as much as the flame had done, so I didn't light another match. My heart was racing, my fingers trembled, but I didn't slow down. The graves still showed no names.\n\nAnd after countless rows of identical tombstones, I reached the end of the path. A large, fancy grave blocked my way, tombstone made of black marble, with a metal cross on top of it. This one had an engraving in faded white letters.\n\n*Here lies a child, died after birth. Unnamed by the parents.*\n\nThe dates were too withered to be read, no flowers lay there and grass grew high and messy all around the tombstone. This had not been visited in a very long time.\n\nThe owl landed in front of the tombstone and looked up at me.\n\nI looked back.\n\nI walked around the grave and realized I had reached the cemetary's end. But in front of me lay no wizard's castle, but a worn-down factory.\n\nI took a deep breath. The fairytale had not been entirely accurate, considering I had encountered neither the beasts nor the spirits. But wether I would find the wizard in a castle or a factory didn't matter to me. For all I cared, he could live in a dumpster. He needed to help me, that was all.\n\nThe Grey Man stood next to the entrance. I was on the right way, after all.\n\nI straightened my back and stepped towards the building. It was grey, except for the red rust and the large metal door was slightly ajar. The Grey Man merely looked at me and vanished, so I pushed the door open and walked in. Before me lay a long corridor, neon lights on the ceiling illuminated everything. I raised my gun and walked, passing metal barrels and a bunch of boxes filled with iron waste. The smell of gasoline filled the air. The lights above me flickered.\n\nI looked behind me.\n\nNo one was there.\n\nAs I reached the end of the hall, I found myself in front of another door. *That's it,* I thought. I was sure I would find the wizard beyond this door and then it would be finally over. I would find Dia. We would go home. If my role was indeed the one of the girl in the fairytale, I would wake up from this cruel nightmare. My happy end was waiting.\n\nI opened the door.\n\nThe room was small and covered in dirt. Cobwebs hung from the ceiling and covered the machinery, mould grew on the walls and debris was littered all over the floor. The air was hot and humid and stuck in my throat, the stench of decay almost made me sick.\n\nAnd in the middle of it all was a dead body. A man in a grey suit, already half decayed, leaned against the wall between cobwebs and mould. The sockets of his eyes were hollow, rotting skin stretched tightly around his skull and his clothes were falling apart, but I recognized him nonetheless.\n\nThe Grey Man.\n\n\"No\", I muttered. I had done everything right. I had listened to the fairytale, walked through the woods, crossed the cemetary, found the factory. He was supposed to be my wizard. He should help me to wake from this nightmare, to return to my world, to get my happy end. But he was dead. For a very long time, he was already dead.\n\n\"No\", I repeated. \"You can't be dead. Please, no.\" I fell to my knees, sobbing. \"You were supposed to help me. I... What should I do now?\"\n\nThe ghost of the Grey Man appeared next to his own corpse, staring at me.\n\n\"Why did you even lead me here, asshole?\", I screamed at him. \"Just to crush my hopes again?\"\n\nHe stared.\n\nDia was out of reach. I had no idea how to leave this place. My last hope was dead, existing only as a mute ghost. I felt lost, hopeless, and utterly defeated.\n\nThe Grey Man had helped me. And yet, it had all been for nothing. The body in front of me was dead. He couldn't help me.\n\nEverything was lost.\n\nThe ghost raised his arm to point behind me. My will to live not yet lost I stumbled to my feet and spun around, only to be faced with the cool metal of a gun against my forehead and Monroe's tired eyes staring at me. He looked worse then before, his clothes were covered in blood, he was pale and his eyes were burning with fever. I felt the heat of his body even across the distance between us. His hand trembled slightly and he breathed shallow. \"I knew it\", he hissed.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"She chose you.\" He pressed the gun harder against my skull. \"She abandoned me because she chose you. But I won't accept it. This is my role, *Kayla,* you won't take this away from me. I will kill you and I will proof to her that I'm the right choice.\"\n\n\"Kill me?\", I repeated. \"You tried that last time, Monroe. You know the definition of insanity? Doing the same shit over and over again and expecting a different result.\" Anger was boiling inside me at this point, born from all the confusion, the fear and the hopelessness. I wanted to hurt him. Wether through my words or with my fists.\n\n\"I remember.\" He gritted his teeth. \"I shot you through the head and here you are. Still standing. She gave you her gift, you little bitch, and she took it from me. I barely healed from your bullets. She abandoned me and that's all your damn fault\", he screamed the last words at me, face distorted into a grimace of fury.\n\n\"Who are you talking about?\", I shouted back.\n\n\"Who I'm talking about? You even had the audacity to call her your fucking wife!\"\n\nI clenched my hands into fists, fingernails digging deep into my skin. \"Don't bring my wife into this\", I hissed.\n\n\"She's not your wife!\" His eyes were burning.\n\nThen everything happened very fast. I realized he was about to pull the trigger, so I jerked my hand up and punched his arm as hard as possible. A shot rang through the air, but it missed my body and I used the momentary distraction to punch Monroe in the face and run past him, towards the door. There was no time to think about his mad rambling as I ran down the hallway.\n\nI had a plan.\n\nFootsteps echoed behind me and I began to run left to right and back again to dodge the bullets. My own gun was still in my hand. I heard bullets hit the wall. A sudden, sharp pain flashed through my shoulder and I screamed, but kept running. He had hit me. The pain was dull, pulsated in my shoulder and my entire arm.\n\nBlood was flowing steadily from the wound. Breathing was difficult, I felt dizzy, but I didn't slow down. The lights still flickered, gunshot after gunshot echoed from the walls. Monroe screamed at me to stop, but I barely listened.\n\nOnce I reached the end of the hallway, I turned around, raised the gun and shot. Three bullets missed. One hit his stomach. One went straight through his head.\n\nHe fell to the floor and I wasted no time. Next to me was a barrel full of gasoline \u2013 or at least something similar. My arm hurt like hell, but I forced myself to ignore it as I used my full body weight to tip it over and empty the liquid onto the floor. It sparkled in rainbow colours in the neon lights.\n\nTrembling fingers retrieved the tinderbox from my pocket. I was panting, my vision was cloudy, I was barely able to light the match.\n\nMonroe made a pained sound that sounded almost like \"no...\".\n\nI threw the match into the liquid and took a step back as I watched the floor and Jack Monroe's body go up in flames. Burning heat hit my cool skin. The pain in my shoulder was mindnumbing.\n\nMonroe was dead. Once and for all.\n\n\"Zombie rules, asshole\", I spat at his burning body. \"Shoot through the head and burn the bodies.\"\n\nI turned and exited the factory before the flames could reach me, stepping outside into the cool night again.\n\nNow that I wasn't running for my life, I had the time to consider Monroe's words. I had come here for answeres and now I was all alone with more questions than ever. Who was *she?* What gift had I received? What did Dia have to do with any of this?\n\nHow could he say she was not my wife?\n\nI remembered her. Nothing else, but she was there. Her laughter, her white dress, her long blonde hair. *You're perfect, Kayla.*\n\nThe pain from the gunshot distracted me way too much.\n\nThe Grey Man \u2013 my wizard \u2013 was dead. Noone would save me now.\n\nMy head was spinning. The adrenaline from literally fighting for my life left my body quickly. Bright spots were dancing in front of my eyes, I couldn't focus my thoughts anymore. I was dizzy, the gun dropped from my hands and fell onto the foor.\n\nMy vision faded to black before I hit the ground.\n\nI lay there for a while, keeping my eyes closed. I felt grass on my skin although I was sure I had collapsed on asphalt. The pain had disappeared, yet I didn't dare to move because I feared it would return.\n\n\"Do you want to know how the fairytale ends?\"\n\nI knew the voice. I knew it all too well. And still, I didn't dare to open my eyes because if that was just a dream, I didn't want to wake up. I wouldn't shatter the illusion of Dia being close to me.\n\n\"The girl enters the castle and finds the wizard dead\", Dia explained. \"She turns on the Dreamer, angry that he has betrayed her like this. She kills him and burns the nightmare to cinders, leaving nothing but an ashen wasteland. And as she stands in the remains of her world, the ghost of the Dreamer appears to her. *Why can't I wake up?* She asks him. Do you know the answer, Kayla?\"\n\nI didn't respond.\n\nDia giggled. \"The girl is dead\", she answered the question herself. \"Doomed to dream for all eternity. *So why did you lie to me?* She says to the Dreamer's ghost. *Why did you tell me the nightmare will end?* And he shakes his head and smiles a sad smile. *Because there was nothing left for you but pleasant lies.* He tells her and disappears forever. The girl has killed the only friend she had left and is trapped in her desolated nightmare forever.\"\n\nI winced. Why? Why did my wife tell me that? What was going on here?\n\n\"There isn't always a happy end, Kayla. And now, show me a little respect and get up. Playing dead doesn't suit you.\"\n\nI opened my eyes and realized I was lying in front of the grave of the nameless child. It was still night, but the grave was different now, flowers were placed all around it and candles were lit. And right in front of the tombstone stood my wife.\n\nIt was weird to see her face after trying to recall it for what seemed like eternity. She was beautiful, stunning even. Bright blue eyes, face like an angel, long blonde hair falling down to her waist. She wore a long, white dress.\n\n\"Dia\", I whispered.\n\nShe laughed again. \"Oh, so you remember our conversation? How unexpected.\"\n\n\"What...\" I slowly stood up. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Our little meeting after you arrived\", she explained patiently.\n\n\"I don't understand.\" Instinctively I reached for the knife in my pocket, but it wasn't there. I had no weapon. \"You're my wife! We... we came here together.\"\n\n\"Wife?\", she repeated. \"Oh dear, you don't remember anything.\"\n\n\"Explain it then!\", I demanded. The whole situation was off, almost unreal but vaguely familiar. Like an old memory, just out of reach. \"What is this place? Where am I?\"\n\n\"If you want me to.\" She leaned casually against the tombstone. \"This is my grave, Kayla. My body is buried here.\"\n\nI looked at the woman who I had called my wife mere minutes ago. The woman I had wanted to find so desparately, who had been my sole motivation for going further and further in this hellscape. \"But... but I...\"\n\nShe shut me up with a simple gesture. \"Now, as you might realize, I don't quite agree with being dead since I can still exist in dreams. Which is, to be honest, not enough. I want to return to the real world, Kayla, but I need a body. A *compatible* one, to be exact.\"\n\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\", I screamed at her. Nothing of that made sense. Dia was my wife. I remembered her.\n\nHer laughter. The white dress. *You're perfect, Kayla.*\n\n\"About the people you met. All of them seemed oh so promising... and yet, they didn't fit.\"\n\n\"Monroe...?\" I didn't finish the question.\n\n\"He was almost perfect\", she sighed. \"The others were nothing. Reduced to insanity in such a short amount of time. He handled it well, but the madness took over, after all.\"\n\nMy mind tried to comprehend the words, but failed. I felt dizzy again and leaned onto a nearby gravestone for support. \"Stop speaking in riddles!\"\n\n\"I'm  not\", she replied. \"You are just a little slow.\"\n\nThis was my wife, I thought, and yet she was a perfect stranger at the same time. My memories were confusing, I felt like my head was about to explode. \"The seamstress and the hanged man and Monroe... they were not compatible with you.\"\n\n\"See, not so hard when you use your brain a little.\" She flashed a condescending smile. \"Poor Jack took it a little personally I think. He became obsessed with me, tried so hard to be perfect so maybe he could fulfill the role he so desparately craved.\"\n\n\"What about the ghost? The Grey Man?\"\n\nShe waved her hand dismissively. \"Merely an echo of another failure. He's no different from the others.\"\n\n\"Why did he help me then?\" Exasparated, I threw my hands in the air.\n\n\"Because he hates me. Contrary to Monroe, he never wanted to become my vessel. Maybe he thought he could actually save you.\" She laughed. \"Poor, confused man.\"\n\n\"This is ridiculous\", I snapped. \"So you're not my wife? Why do I remember you then? What happened, why am I here? I survived a bullet through the head, god damn it. I can't remember anything and I want answers right now!\"\n\nFor what felt like hours, she simply looked at me, the hint of a smile on her lips. \"You still don't realize\", she then said. \"Are you hungry, Kayla? Thirsty?\"\n\nI blinked. What had that to do with anything. \"I'm... no. No, I'm not\", I answered.\n\n\"You don't need to eat or drink, a bullet doesn't kill you... you really can't figure it out by yourself?\" She raised an eyebrow. As I didn't answer, her lips twisted into a smirk. \"You're dead, Kayla.\"\n\nThe terror that gripped me in that moment was indescribable. I felt my whole body go numb, my skin ran cold as I clutched onto the gravestone. That wasn't true. It couldn't be. I was standing there, I was alive. There was no way that could be true. I shook my head, again and again and again as if I could simply shake the thought away.\n\nAnd suddenly, memories flooded my racing mind as all the pieces of the puzzle fell into place.\n\nI had been in the car. The police car. My partner had sat in the driver's seat, proudly showing me his wedding ring. A silver one, with a blue crystal inside. We had been driving towards a town called Emerald Bay, as apparently some campers had gone missing there. The sun had just set as we entered the woods when all of a sudden, a person had appeared on the road right in front of us. The car had spiraled out of control and crashed against a tree. It had caught on fire immediately. I had tried to get out, but the door wouldn't budge and I had felt the fire burning the skin off my bones. I had screamed until I had finally fallen unconscious.\n\nI had died at that point.\n\nAnd then I had woken up again, in this exact place, with Dia in front of me. She had asked me if I wanted to live and of course, I had agreed immediately. \"You're perfect, Kayla\", she had said with a smile and then shadows had taken over my body and I had woken up in the woods, my body burnt and my mind delirious from fever.\n\nThe crashed car in the woods had been mine.\n\nThe dead policeman had been my partner.\n\nI was dead.\n\n\"Do you remember now?\", Dia asked.\n\nMy body was shaking. I nodded, tried to breathe and realized at the same time that it didn't matter. I did not need oxygen anymore. I was a walking corpse. \"You want me as your new body\", I said to Dia; my voice sounded weak.\n\n\"Oh, I would have loved to have you\", she agreed. \"But sadly, you don't fit. Not as perfect as I thought, after all.\"\n\n\"Then let me go!\"\n\nShe laughed. \"You died, Kayla. You're only standing here because my shadows keep your heart beating. There's no place left for you but my nightmare.\"\n\nI wrapped my arms tightly around my torso, drawing shaky breaths. The wife I had searched for did not exist. There was no way for me to go home.\n\nAll hope was lost.\n\n\"What do you want from me?\", I asked Dia weakly.\n\n\"For now? Nothing.\" She stepped closer and lay a hand on my arm. \"The madness will take you soon enough and you'll bring me new bodies, just like Jack did.\"\n\nI shook my head again. \"Never\", I spat.\n\n\"We'll see about that, Kayla.\" She turned around and walked away, back towards the grave, as the world around me faded to white.\n\nI woke in front of the factory again. The wound in my shoulder did no longer exist.\n\nNow this is the end. I wrote everything down and if this warning reaches you, please remember to stay away from Emerald Bay, no matter what reason could lead you here.\n\nI still don't understand everything, but most of it is clear now. Monroe has just saved me to sacrifice me to his beloved Dia himself, the Grey Man has saved me to spite Dia and everybody else has just succumed to insanity. This place is her dream and yet somehow, it's also real.\n\nI'm afraid of what she might be capable of if she ever finds a suitable body.\n\nThe moon stands unmoving on the black sky. Everything I have thought to remember is a lie. I have no wife. I am not alive. All I have done since I woke up in the forest has been for nothing.\n\nI won't end like the others. I won't kill innocent people and help Dia's mad goal. As soon as this is finished, I will return to the factory, douse myself in gasoline and burn this body to ashes.\n\nI'm hyper aware of the shadows inside me, constricting around my heart to keep it beating.\n\nI don't remember anything before the car crash. To anyone I might leave behind: I'm sorry. And goodbye.\n\nMy story is over.\n\nNo last sunrise for me to see.\n\nI hope this reaches the real world, however that might be possible.\n\nStay away from Emerald Bay.\n\nOnly death waits here.\n\n\\-  Kayla Chase\n\n**This is where the diary ends. Dismissing this as a made-up story would be easy, I know, but I guess I should mention that my friends returned to the place where they found the diary. They've read it too and decided against all the warnings to search for Emerald Bay.**\n\n**According to them, they had made it into the woods where the hunter's cabin was supposed to be, when they had encountered a person with \"charred skin\". They aren't sure if the burnt person wanted to attack them or drive them off, but they ran away and haven't returned there yet.**\n\n**They got separated though.**\n\n**And one hasn't come back yet.**\n\n[X](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/LadyOfHellWrites\/)","99":"[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qo2vbu\/our_vacation_got_turned_into_a_hunting_trip_where\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nYou guys wanted an update, so here you go.\n\nFirst off, sorry if this is all over the place. My life is currently in shambles, and I\u2019m crying as I write this so bear with me. Not to give any foreshadowing or whatever, but the past few days have not been pleasant in the slightest.\n\nSecond off, I\u2019m starting with the happy moments before anything because I know the bad moments will feel horrible to discuss. I\u2019m tired of crying, so be patient with me as I relive the happy moments with you guys. They weren\u2019t the happiest because we did have to be very quiet out of fear that the beings would hear us, but they have become some of my favorite last memories with the love of my life.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of time to play board games whenever your power is off, cell phone towers are down, and you are stuck in a house for days on end. It was difficult due to having to be quiet and using candlelight during nights, but it was better than just sitting there doing nothing. I won probably 10 games of monopoly, 6 of uno, and 3 of Phase 10. Who knew the fear of dying at any moment could make your love for board games more powerful? It also made me realize how much I truly loved my girlfriend, and I was glad my possible last moments would be with her of all people.\n\nThe main thing it was hard to do was to eat. It was difficult to cook things and not make a lot of noise, so we often just ate junk food. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to eat a pop tart or honey bun ever again simply just from being tired of them but also to avoid memories of this time. Hell, the board games will probably never bring me happy memories after these events, either, but at least they created some happiness while they could.\n\nOther than board games and junk food, we mostly sat by the fire. Her grandpa thought of the idea for us to have notepads to write things for conversation. We would spend hours just chit-chatting and doodle on those little notepads. My girlfriend attempted to draw a donkey that was so stupid-looking that we almost busted out laughing over it. We started crying due to trying to stifle the laughter. I now have that dumb donkey doodle folded and placed in a fold in my wallet, and that is where it will always stay.\n\nThe good didn\u2019t last long, no matter how much I hoped it would, so let me get into the parts I know you guys really care about. We decided our best option would be to hide in the house. Barricade all doors, board up all windows, block any exits or anything that could be forcefully made into an exit. All of us carried a gun: Gramps and I had shotguns while my girlfriend carried a pistol. We usually stayed in the same room together, especially whenever we heard sounds outside, besides Gramps and I taking turns to go around the house and check that none of our exits were infiltrated. There were a few times that we heard them trying to get in, bashing themselves against doors so hard that I thought they would come off the hinges. One night they had smashed all the windows, leaving only the wooden boards. They slammed themselves against those too, and their blood seeped through the tiny cracks between the boards as the remaining glass shards cut them upon impact. It wasn\u2019t long before we had to nail more boards, and it was while doing this that everything started going to hell.\n\nIt had been a while since we had heard any activity outside, so we thought it was safe. We had been listening for hours after all and thought they had moved on in search of other women. I was helping Gramps out by nailing the boards as he held them whenever we heard a scuffling outside. We both immediately froze, afraid to make any noise if it was one of them. We sat there for what felt like ten minutes as we heard something move around outside whenever my arms began to burn. By the ten more minutes had passed, the muscles in my arms were burning like a forest fire, and I knew Gramps was struggling as well because I could see his arms shaking.\n\nHe slightly moved, and my girlfriend and I immediately stared daggers at him. I felt bad afterward, though, because I knew he was struggling harder than he was letting on. We watched as he carefully moved, trying to remain as silent as he possibly could. He held up a hand to his lips and made a *shh*ing motion before holding up three fingers. I nodded, understanding that he meant to let go on the count of three. I could tell the being hadn\u2019t heard anything because it was still shuffling around outside. I waited until he gently placed his hands back on the board we had been nailing and looked at me. I readied myself as he began to nod, and on the third nod we both softly removed the board from the wall and backed up. There were three boards still remaining on the door, definitely enough to reinforce it against only one of the beings.\n\nI noticed the nails a second too late, but it wasn\u2019t like there was anything I could do to stop them. They were unscrewing themselves one by one and dropping to the floor. Our main source of protection was dropping like dead flies, and we all stood there in fear and watched as it happened. We felt powerless to do anything else. It was silent after the last nail dropped, and the ring of the nail bouncing on the floor echoed through the room.\n\nAnd then, all hell broke loose as a fist slammed through one of the boards so powerfully that it shot towards the wall opposite the door before clattering to the floor. A perfect rectangular indention of a 2 by 4 was now there from the impact. Before we could even fully react, more were shooting towards the wall. One accidentally smacked my girlfriend in the arm and sliced it open. The next thing we know, Gramps starts blasting his shotgun as the corpses try to enter the house, wailing and screeching at top volume. I start shooting as well, and I yell to my girlfriend to go find a place to hide.\n\nOne of the beings leapt over the 5 others that are blocking the doorway, climbing over their outreached and decaying hands. He managed to grab the front of Gramp\u2019s shirt, tugging on it so hard that it ripped. The beings began to scream even louder as they realized their buddy had clawed Gramp\u2019s pretty deep. Blood flowed down his chest as we both continued to shoot. We were slowly running out of ammo, though, and I need we\u2019d have to retreat to go find more eventually. Gramp\u2019s chest was gushing blood by this point, and I knew he would have to rest, too.\n\nRight as I thought this, he collapsed to the ground with a grunt. I kept shooting, managing to take three down just with headshots. I allowed myself only a moment of pride before I ran to Gramps. I could hear some in the distance, but for right now we were alone.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get to her,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave me. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would never forgive me if I leave you,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWell at least she\u2019d still be alive.\u201d\n\nI debated arguing some more and trying to help him anyway, but I could hear the beings growing closer. I simply nodded and headed off to look for her.\n\nI got there too late, though. I ran into the guest bedroom just as I saw them surrounding her, a whole swarm of them. I couldn\u2019t tell how many due to all the hectic violent movements. They had managed to break through the boards on the windows. They took up almost the entire room, practically shoving each other onto the old squeaky mattress as they fought over their prey. She was tangled up in their grips, being snatched this way and that. She screamed at me to run, to flee for safety, but I felt that same paralyzing force take over my body. All I could do was watch, even though every fiber of my being screamed at me to try to help, to do *something.* A part of me knew that it would be pointless considering it took multiple gunshots to even take down one, which I had absolutely no ammo to do, but I felt like a piece of shit boyfriend at that moment. It was supposed to be my job to protect her, and I had failed.\n\nThey fought over her like wild animals, clawing and biting at her body as she screamed in pain. A few of them left the group once they had ripped off a chunk of flesh. I thought they would notice me, but they were too focused on their snacks. My eyes flashed over their sharp teeth as they nibbled on it before jumping back to my girlfriend\u2019s torture. The fearful paralysis stayed over me until I watched them begin to stretch all four of her limbs out way beyond their limits. I started to scream as well as I realized they were trying to rip her apart. Our screams mingled into a chorus of agony, hers at being torn apart and mine at watching it happen.\n\nI watched as they took her arms off, the arms I had felt wrapped around me only hours before. They ripped them off so forcefully that I felt her blood splatter across my face, barely missing my gaping mouth. One began to nibble on her left hand, and tears poured from my eyes as I remembered imagining the perfect ring for that hand. I had even decided on one and had it hidden in my nightstand, waiting for the perfect time, but these demons had taken that dream from me. I was watching my girlfriend be eaten alive, and I had no way to stop it.\nI screamed until I felt my vocal cords giving out, until I saw her head slump down as she passed out from the pain. At least, I hoped it was her passing out and not dying.\n\nOnce they were done devouring her body, they surrounded me, aggressively sniffing me. I flinched every time they got too close. Feeling their decayed and damaged skin scratch across my body was overwhelmingly uncomfortable, and I had to fight the urge to gag. The smell of rot and decay did nothing to help, either. It was suddenly more noticeable since I wasn\u2019t focused on them eating my girlfriend. I didn\u2019t want to do anything to upset them or make them want to kill me, or worse, turn me into a fresh buffet like they had my girlfriend, so I fought my urge to flinch and stayed as still as I possibly could.\n\nSuddenly, a cry came from outside. Another one of their beings was emitting this god-awful screeching noise, calling them to it. Their attention became focused on it, and they shot out of the room, nearly taking the door frame off as they jammed their bodies through it.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I managed it, but I made it out. I\u2019m currently at a truck stop an hour away. I was shocked that our car hadn\u2019t been destroyed when I made it out of the house, but I guess the beings had forgotten what vehicles were since they had been undead. Or maybe they never thought we would make it that far. All I know is that when I did, I shot out of that hellish community like a bat out of hell. I didn\u2019t even care about the potholes. Even if all of those tires had gone flat, I would have driven until the rims on that thing were flat, too. I\u2019m not even going to lie, I drove over a few dead bodies laying on the roads. I don\u2019t know who they are, but I was more concerned about avoiding death than offending the dead, especially with a whole army of the undead on the prowl.\n\nNow, I\u2019m waiting for the cops to show up. I have no idea what happened to my phone, so I called them using a payphone. I have no idea if they will believe me, but someone has to help the people in that town, if they\u2019re all even still [alive.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ShortTalesWithAsh\/)","100":" [Mr. Wallet Throat was definitely a good start](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/), but I have a hell of a lot more stories to share. I\u2019ve seen many, many bodies over the years, and it\u2019s more rare for the corpses condition to be natural-- a fall, hypothermia, starvation, suicide, the likes-- but I\u2019ll share some more cases of the weird with you here. I share one that\u2019s, well, supernatural I suppose, and one that is not.  Or at least doesn\u2019t look supernatural to me, it\u2019s honestly hard to tell. The non-bizarre deaths seem more supernatural than the strange, at this point.\n\nAt one point, roughly four years ago, we had a surprising dry spell when it came to the dead. The flow of corpses into my office is usually very steady, corpse after corpse landing on my table, varying degrees of weird for me to dissect, so when I\u2019d gotten only one new body in over two weeks I knew something was up. If I\u2019d been just a few years less experienced then, I may have felt relaxed or relieved at such a thing, but by then I had a fairly tenuous grasp on what was going on. I still, now, have no real idea what is going on, but I at least know how I should and shouldn\u2019t handle things.\n\nAt nearly the three week mark of no real work to do, my nerves felt shot. I\u2019d spent all that time waiting for the next shoe to drop, preparing for whatever nightmare would roll in through that door at any moment. Despite all that mental preparation, I still was nowhere near prepared for what would be brought to me.\n\nHave you ever heard of fetal abduction? If not, well, it\u2019s pretty self explanatory, but nonetheless I\u2019ll elaborate. \n\nFetal abduction is a fairly rare kind of crime. It involves a pregnant non-consenting party having a crude c-section performed in order for the abductor to steal the fetus. I don\u2019t need to give an in depth description of exactly what would go on to have you understand how horrible and gruesome such an act is, so it\u2019s really no surprise that it\u2019s such an uncommon crime to commit. Most people want to unleash that sort of violence on someone, and even the type who would wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to steal a fetus. What would you even do with a fetus? So often in these instances both the child and mother die, so there\u2019s no real gain for the perpator by stealing away the child. The crime is usually perpetrated by another woman who often will fake their own pregnancy in order to get closer to the target.\n\nI\u2019m sure by now that you understand why I\u2019ve brought this up.\n\nThe day she was brought in was blisteringly hot and muggy. Thankfully my office is always well air conditioned for obvious reasons, but when the EMT\u2019s and Police arrived at my door, they were all sweating bullets. I knew right away that what I was dealing with would no doubt be unbelievably disgusting.\n\nThey brought her in and helped me place her atop my table, and as soon as I unzipped that black bag I was hit with the overwhelming, repugnant stench of rot and decay.\n\nThe summer heat and moisture in the air had badly exacerbated the decomposition and the state of her corpse was as bad as you\u2019d think. Imagine one of those rubber stress balls with the liquid inside-- better yet, imagine one with one of those little animal faces on it. Got the mental visual? Now imagine what they look like when you squeeze them in your fist, the rubber stretching thin and popping out from between your fingers. That\u2019s what she looked like, specifically, her face. It was likely someone had taken an air pump to the skin and fat of her face, legs and arms and pumped it just until it was bordering on popping. It was made an even more disconcerting sight when combined with how deflated her torso looked.\n\nThe cut was across her lower stomach, and from the waist down she was soaked in blood. Clearly, from the amount of bleeding, it had been down while she was still very much alive. That theory was further proven by her chipped and broken fingernails, some fingers missing the entire nail itself. She\u2019d put up a real struggle as this had been done to her.\n\nWhoever had done this hadn\u2019t been particularly careful. They\u2019d mutilated many different organs in the process of cutting open her womb, her intestines and colon taking the brunt of that damage. A punctured colon smells awful, by the way, the horrendous mixture of rot, blood and shit was as bad as one could imagine. I ended up wetting the inside of my mask with vanilla in an attempt to block out the stench, and while it had helped significantly, the smell was burned into every fibre of my being for days after. I was honestly just short of taking a tomato juice bath in hopes of at least masking the smell until I could be able to get it to go away permanently.\n\nThe umbilical cord had been hanging out and the afterbirth was in place still inside. With how roughly the person had gone at it, I was sure that the fetus itself had likely been damaged.\n\nThe baby was never found-- that didn\u2019t surprise me at all. I doubted that the child had survived the attack and was most likely buried or burned somewhere. Maybe one day the remains will be found, but with how vast these mountains and forests are, I really doubt it at this point.\n\nThe next I\u2019ll tell you about is a little bit weirder. I mentioned in the previous post the man without the lower body. That is a trend in my town, people appearing out in the woods missing limbs. That in and of itself, finding a corpse missing parts, is not too unusual, but these bodies look like those of people with birth defects. It\u2019s as if the limbs had never been there, something that is heavily contradicted by the victims' family photos and the like.\n\nThis instance is fairly recent, only about a year and a half ago I believe, when I got one such case.\n\nIt was early morning that he was dropped off to me, and the moment I saw the cadaver, I knew the exact cause of death.\n\nFrom the neck down, his body was spotless. There was no sign of injury, no bruising, no broken bones, not even a scratch from a bush. If it weren't for the fact that the top of his neck was only smooth, unblemished skin with no head attached, I\u2019d have figured the guy would be alive.\n\nA person obviously cannot live without a head, and while it isn\u2019t unheard of for tragic birth defects that cause a fetus not to develop a head to occur, they\u2019re just that. Fetuses. This was a fully grown, developed, adult man! You can\u2019t just live thirty-some years with no head, that isn\u2019t how it works. It was so beyond bizarre, I haven\u2019t seen something quite like it since. Just like every other corpse he was shuttled away by the Sheriff to wherever he\u2019s from, and I never did learn who the guy was. The guy was entirely nude when he came in, so there was no form of identification on him.\n\nIf I recall correctly, they found him down in a small ravine. I\u2019d say he must have fallen down into it, or perhaps even climbed, but that would have ended in some sort of bruising somewhere on his body, whether it be the hands and feet from the climbing, or his back or whichever body part would have hit the rocks below. There should have, somewhere, been some sort of damage, and yet he was fine from the neck down.\n\nThe head never ended up getting sent to me, which could mean that it was never found *or* that the Sheriff came to the conclusion that taking that route wasn\u2019t necessary. If it was found, I would have preferred to be able to take a look at the thing, to analyze it and see if there was any damage to it. Maybe someday in the future I\u2019ll finally be able to get my hands on one of these disappearing limbs-- or at the very least, get to know where they are ending up. Who or what is taking them.\n\nOkay, so there was a whole lot of interest in my screaming undead guest, which is totally understandable. Hearing about corpses sitting upright and screaming like a banshee is a bit unusual and would draw any rational human being's attention. It definitely caught my attention, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nI won\u2019t delay it any longer-- I know you\u2019re all here for the details of the situation, and it\u2019s probably best that I\u2019m able to let off a bit of the mental load that the whole situation that\u2019s gone down these last few days.\n\nThe day had been blissfully uneventful, I\u2019d spent most of it sitting at my desk dicking around on my computer, just generally browsing the internet. My favourite types of days are the boring ones. The ones where I can just sit down and stare at a wall for eight hours, thinking about absolutely nothing with absolutely no responsibility. They were rare, so every opportunity I got I relished in the uninterrupted, sweet sweet boring.\n\nI\u2019d been so close to the end of my work day when I\u2019d received the call. Another corpse had been found several kilometers outside of town and they needed me to, at the very least, refrigerate it until the morning. As annoying as the call felt in the moment, it was definitely still preferable to getting it once I\u2019d already left the building. If they had called later I\u2019d have had to return back to work to refrigerate the body for morning, and there is truly nothing more obnoxious than getting called back to work after having just left, something I\u2019m sure some of you can relate to.\n\nI got ready for their arrival, and about twenty minutes after the call an ambulance without it\u2019s lights or siren pulled into the small lot. We went through the usual pleasantries, they unloaded the gurney with the body bag atop it, I held the door open for them, we all lifted the cadaver onto the cold metal slab that served as the drawer for the mortuary fridge. It was a simple process, and I dismissed their offers for any more help. I appreciated it, of course, but there really wasn\u2019t much else for me to do that night. All I needed to do was push the drawer back in, shut off my computer and the rest of the lights and go.\n\nUsually the idea of having a body to work on the moment I arrived at work was annoying, but  from what I\u2019d seen of the person as we shed him of his bag it wouldn\u2019t actually be all that much work. The only injury I could see was a scabbed up gash peeking out from his blood and mud stained shirt. No guts falling out, bodily fluids oozing all over the inside of the fridge nor anything of the extremely yucky nature that so often entered my establishment. It was refreshing in a morbid way, not having someone who was torn to bits or bloated to hell on my table.\n\nI pushed the fridge shut, sheathing the body into the cold darkness within. I locked it using one of the dozens of keys on my chain and reserved myself to forget all about that responsibility for the night.\n\nI shut down my computer, turned off the office lights and was about to shut off the mortuary's lights as well when I first heard the noise. It was quiet, a soft thud, and then after a moment of silence, scratching. \n\nMy first horrible thought was, \u2018oh, *fuck*, the rats are back.\u2019 Those goddamn rodents kept getting into this place, I\u2019d been setting traps for *years* to catch them, and yeah, they worked for the first while, but these suckers adapted and learned to avoid them. No matter what kind of trap I bought, cheap or expensive, they made their way around them, ignoring them as if they didn\u2019t exist! I have called the local pest control companies several times and everytime they managed to clear some of them out, those fuckers always came back. I even paid extra to an out of town company to come in to try and rid the place of them, and it was the exact same results! Well, with the added negative that the guy they sent up here ended up vanishing\u2026 I\u2019ll probably be getting him on my table any day now, honestly.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a whole lot I could do about a rat at the moment, I could try to catch it, but if that thing bit me I could catch all sorts of weird diseases that I really prefer not to catch.\n\nI stood still, waiting for the sound to return. After a few moments of complete silence, the only noise being the soft sounds of my own breathing, I began to believe that perhaps I may have been hearing things. While I don\u2019t have a history of that sort of stuff, it really wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it were to happen. Spending your entire day with only dead bodies for company has just the kinds of effects on a person that you\u2019d suspect. Before I allowed myself to feel relieved, another thud came. To my dismay, it seemed to be coming from the just shut drawer.\n\nI couldn\u2019t leave knowing one of those rodents was in there with the corpse-- a rat would without a doubt have a total blast gnawing on a human corpse and putting the burden of explaining to that guys loved ones that a peckish rodent went to town on their friend onto the police was completely unfair. I\u2019d also get chewed out by the Sheriff for being so neglectful, so with great annoyance, I steeled myself to at the very least chase the little asshole out of the refrigerator. Better to have it running around the open room for now than allowing it to stay in its current residence.\n\nFiddling with my keys, I jammed it into the lock, turning it and listening to the click that reverberated throughout the room. The acoustics had always been poor, so things tended to echo in the large, open room.\n\nI paused and waited, listening for any sign of movement inside. Nothing came, and with a steadying breath, I slowly pulled the drawer open. My body tensed and I snapped my arms up, ready to smack at it or yell, anything to startle it out of the metal container, but I found no movement. There was no furry rat, just a plain old chilly cold dead body.\n\nI pulled the drawer out further, until it was completely open, but I still saw no sign of any animal.\n\nI grimaced slightly. Perhaps it was in another drawer-- if that was the case, it could stay there for the night. This guy was currently the only body being stored, so it wasn\u2019t like it\u2019d have any other cool snacks to feast on. I did debate checking the surrounding lockers, but a slight, twitching movement snapped my attention downward.\n\nI was staring at the hand of the man, completely still. Sometimes, dead people move. Muscles tense in rigor mortis, sometimes eyelids will flutter, lungs will release trapped air and the bladder and bowels will expel their disgusting waste. Really, seeing a corpse twitch isn\u2019t so unusual. \n\nI shook my head dismissively. This was all stupid and unnecessary, I was tired and really just wanted to go home, eat some shitty frozen to-go dinner and curl up with my cat to read a book for an hour or two.\n\n\u201cSHIT--\u201d The corpse sat upright with a shout, voice breaking around the words, eyes blowing wide with terror as he bellowed out as loud as he could.\n\nNow, look. I\u2019d like to say that I reacted rationally to this situation, that perhaps I replied some professional words to convey my surprise and confusion at the once very, very dead body that now sat ramrod straight in front of me. Sometimes people get mistaken for dead, it\u2019s much less frequent these days due to modern science being able to nip accidental burials in the bud, but every once in a while, usually in places which didn\u2019t have much access to the necessary tools to assess someone thoroughly.\n\nThis, though, was not the case whatsoever.\n\n\u201c--FUCK!\u201d I shouted in surprise. My body moved entirely without my brain's permission and my fist went flying. I popped the guy right in the nose, sending his head flying back and smashing hard into the slab beneath him. The noise was hollow and echoed around the room, bouncing off the walls and ringing like a gong.\n\nHe was still, I was still. I was frozen in place because he wasn\u2019t moving. I feared the worst, that I\u2019d hit the guy so hard I\u2019d killed him, but that thought was soon washed away by something significantly more concerning.\n\nThe gash that had been on his chest just earlier seemed to be healing. The best way that I can describe what I saw was like it was a timelapse of a cut healing. Look one up, you\u2019ll get what I mean. The flesh mended itself, discolouration of the skin fading away to instead take it\u2019s more natural peachy colour, the paleness in his face revitalizing, flood seeming to flow. It looked almost as though frames were being skipped, it looked entirely unnatural to the human eye, like someone had turned the quality down on my sight as I analyzed it. As the wound skipped from gaping wound, dark scab to pale, years old looking scar in the matter of moments, I knew that I for a fact had not killed the guy with my hit to his face.\n\nWhen the wound had finally finished it\u2019s fast forwarding, a slow, thick glob of blood oozed from his left nostril and down his face.\n\nI checked the guy for a pulse, and indeed he had one. It was steady, definitely not what it should have been considering the grievous wound he\u2019d just had. \n\nI couldn\u2019t leave him there, and so I didn\u2019t. I ended up staying put in the building, sitting in my office with the door wide open to listen for any sign he was waking up again. In those few hours I typed up the first part while waiting for him to regain consciousness.\n\nI\u2019ve had some weird shit go down in my building, but I think that this whole situation may take the cake, kind of by a long shot.\n\nHe\u2019s woken up a few times, but making conversation with zombie-not-zombie is a lot like talking to a drunk brick wall. He\u2019s lethargic and can\u2019t seem to speak properly, like his mouth can\u2019t really keep up with his brain. I got a lot of \u201cWhere am I?\u201d and \u201cWho are you?\u201d, but once I told him what he was requesting to hear it was like he\u2019s brain went and shit itself.\n\nI\u2019m not entirely sure what I\u2019m meant to do. I\u2019m debating calling the Sheriff at the moment-- but I\u2019m concerned what will come of that. I\u2019m just as guilty, as complicit as everyone else in this shithole, but I can\u2019t send this guy away to them in good conscience. I\u2019m not superstitious, I promise, but I do see what goes on here. I\u2019ve turned a blind eye to these thinly veiled cover-ups for so long\u2026 And I\u2019m unsure whether I should continue to, in this instance.\n\nI\u2019m going to mull it over some more, I\u2019ll see what I can do. I wish I had someone in my corner right now. I wish that someone was Williams, and maybe he could be.\n\nI need to think it all over properly. If anyone has any advice about how to proceed with this situation it\u2019d be really appreciated. I guess you, my readers, are in my corner, I guess. You\u2019re the only ones who I can confide this all in, after all.\n\n\\-Esme Hall, 2016, October 15th.","101":" \n\n5\/23\/21\n\nI live next to a lake a fairly large one and very deep. I built the house myself but it\u2019s been run down for a few years now but the deck has always been well structured. But lately the lake has been a bit discolored it\u2019s usual dark green and even darker shades of aqua blue have been replaced with a dark, dark shade of reddish pink. \n\nI don\u2019t know what had caused it or if it\u2019s normal or not but they usually fade after a few days but today I wanted to write what I see down because\u2026 it isn\u2019t going away as if the lake itself is bleeding as if whatever is causing this decided it didn\u2019t want to stop this time. I\u2019ve thrown packages of meat into the lake occasionally to keep\u2026 whatever inside satisfied but maybe it wasn\u2019t enough.. Maybe this time I just wasn\u2019t enough. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing this but on the days that I had forgotten or just didn\u2019t want to put the meat into the river shark like spikes would pierce through the water like a knife through butter.\n\nI don\u2019t know what 's inside of that.  Almost like clockwork I saw the spikes cutting through the water as I finished writing that I\u2019ll go throw the meat into the lake and continue to write once I\u2019m finished with the god forsaken task. It\u2019s getting more and more agitated. It rammed the deck. I don't know how big this thing is but given the shadow it looked as long as a school bus at least. I\u2019m scared of the thing in all honesty.\n\nMy name isn\u2019t important, it's not relevant to the thing inside of my lake. I\u2019ve called the police about it but they don\u2019t care. They say \u201cthere\u2019s nothing in the lake sir we searched it two weeks ago.\u201d  So they\u2019re not an option to help me get rid of this thing.\n\nAnother thing is that when I was fishing I got a fish but\u2026 it was half eaten by something that looked like it had to have been ten times its size. But I\u2019m genuinely worried about what\u2019s inside that lake\u2026 and I thought that snakes would\u2019ve been the worst thing inside of that thing and speaking of snakes I haven\u2019t seen any around in at least a few weeks.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside of the lake but I need to rest before I continue writing. I want to make sure that anything that does happen is recorded so that if anything happens I at least have the reason I did.\n\n5\/24\/21\n\nI woke up to sounds of scraping across wood and when I went outside with a flashlight half the deck was gone. Not floating, Gone all of it. I don\u2019t know what that thing had done but it was so big now it could eat half of an entire damn deck. Safe to say I\u2019ve given it extra meat today. I don't know how large this thing is but it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s beginning to worry and scare me.\n\nI spent the day away from the house. I took a drive in the car away from the house and went to a restaurant. Just ate a burger and things like that but when I got home the lake was pure red. A dark crimson red. As if the thing inside had been eating more than what was in the lake and more of the deck had been missing as well. I think I\u2019m going to take the day off from writing this\u2026 this is beginning to be more than I can handle we\u2019re talking about a gargantuan sized creature inside of my lake. It\u2019s\u2026 extraordinary.\n\n5\/25\/21\n\nI woke up fairly well this morning. I had thrown more meat into the lake last night so I was hoping the thing was satisfied. So it seems like it is. I\u2019m gonna lay down after I throw some more meat into the lake more than usual hopefully. Once I let the thing eat I\u2019m hoping to get some well earned rest. If anything happens today I\u2019ll write down what happens.\n\n5\/26\/21\n\nWell nothing happened yesterday but I woke up to a sore and scratchy roar that sounded like a mix between a lion\u2019s roar and a dog's bark.  I finally thought of an idea after hours of long pondering but\u2026 I\u2019ve finally come to a conclusion of what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m going to kill it. I'm going to take a boat out to the middle of the lake and kill it using a gun. I\u2019ll use the meat and a deer\u2019s carcass to lure it. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll see when I do this and I don\u2019t know what even is inside of this lake. But whatever it is. I\u2019m going to find out even if it kills me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nMr. Heartman was never heard from again. His neighbors called the local police. After hearing yells then nothing else afterwards. They were used to him yelling since they\u2019ve seen him yelling at his lake or something inside of it. But nothing was found at his house, not even a boat like his journal says. The lake he lived by was renamed in his honor to \u201cHeartman\u2019s Lake\u201d. The reason this is even being written on the report is because there have been whales and sharks found eaten by an unknown creature in the nearby ocean. We believe whatever was inside of Mr. Heartman\u2019s lake is the thing that is now hunting. We don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to do when it finds out there\u2019s a giant meal waiting on the mainland. All it has to do is look and it\u2019ll know. It doesn\u2019t have to restrict itself to a lake or an ocean. It\u2019ll know we\u2019re the next food on the menu and it may know soon.\n\n\\-Detective Priston, Case 368, The Heartman incident","102":"TRANSCRIBED: 11\/09\/2021\n\nTRANSCRIBER: Maker Bachvarov\n\nITEM 9 OF UNKNOWN\n\nITEM TITLE: Finnick and Titus #1\n\n[Table of Contents](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Bestzugen\/comments\/q6uicq\/records_of_bridgerton_reformatory_table_of\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n[Part 8](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qnhuht\/records_of_bridgerton_reformatory_part_8\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nTRANSCRIBER NOTE: This part of the note is written on a cloth napkin we found stapled to the notebook paper that the rest of the letter is written on.\n\nI've been down here ten minutes and already I can't wait to leave. I gotta say, I'm not a huge fan of this \u201call for the greater good\u201d business. I'm writing this on a napkin in the pantry. I\u2019ll write more later, but in case I don't get the chance I want you to know that you were right. On this end at least. I\u2019ve already seen so many people that I recognize. You know them too, the ones who went missing for being \u201crowdy\u201d or whatever equally outdated term the Headmistress used.\n\nNone of them have seen me, though. I\u2019ve tried, believe me I have tried. But if they look at me at all they just turn their eyes in my direction, as if there\u2019s nothing in front of them.\n\nTRANSCRIPTION BREAK: Here the letter switches from the initial napkin to the attached piece of notebook paper.\n\nI don't have much time. The people down here, they don't get a break. The chef has everyone working 24 hours straight. If I can't find a way to catch some shut eye and sneak a little food now and then we may not be able to continue this undercover mission as long as we\u2019d hoped. *I* may not be able to. You hold on as long as you can; you're more important to this than I am.\n\nThe things going on down here aren't exactly what you had suspected, but they're close. I know you thought that the missing kids were just being put to work, but it\u2019s worse. If they had just been put to work they would still talk, they would still respond to anything other than the chef\u2019s neverending barrage of orders. He doesn't stop. I'm not even entirely sure that he breaths between barks.\n\nI need a way to record what goes on down here so we can get it to the proper authorities. Taking photos won't do it, though. The chef surveys this place with a close and suspicious eye; I wouldn't be surprised to find out that he and the Headmistress are in cahoots with one another about something strange; something they don't want getting out.\n\nI\u2019ll write to you again when I can, but not as often as we first planned. Keep a close eye on the kid we\u2019re using as a mail runner. I mean, it\u2019s not like you could really stop them if someone decided to do something to him, but maybe you can dissuade them.\n\nEND TRANSCRIPTION\n\nTRANSCRIBER NOTES: When I left yesterday a woman stopped me before I actually made it to the door. She was an older woman, and her back was hunched as though straining against a weight that her crocheted shawl couldn't account for. Her face was kind, but that doesn't change the fact that the moment she opened her mouth to talk to me I wanted to get as far away from her as possible.\n\n\u201cHello dear, are you well?\u201d\n\n\u201cI, um, I'm fine. I\u2019ve got to get home. My cat, he gets lonely, you know?\u201d I tried to use that half-assed excuse as a reason to skirt around her and leave, but she got in my way far quicker than she should have been able to.\n\n\u201cYou don't have a cat.\u201d She looked into my eyes from under heavy brows and I felt a chill run down my spine. Her eyes, they were human, I suppose, but they were hollow. It was clear that she saw far more of me than I could have ever guessed, and in return she gave nothing.\n\n\u201cNo, I don't. What do you want with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to remain intact, that\u2019s all.\u201d She took my bicep in her hand and we started walking. I wasn't sure where she was taking me at first, but after the first couple of turns lined up I realized she was taking me home.\n\n\u201cThere are people,\u201d she said, her voice sounding like crinkling paper, \u201cwho have been watching you. Not unkind, but interference of any kind is interference. I am here to keep them from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't know what you're talking about, ma\u2019am.\u201d The response was automatic, robotic.\n\n\u201cOf course you don't.\u201d She sounded sympathetic. \u201cYou won't for some time still, if things go according to plan. But your mind, it was falling under the influence of dangerous powers and human frailties. I am here to assure that all parts of you remain intact and functional, that is all. Speak of the devil.\u201d\n\nThe old woman\u2019s hand left my arm and she stepped out before me to face a man who had just prior exited an alleyway. The man was dirty; pale hair and paler skin only illuminated the grime that clung to him. He had his sights set on the woman.\n\n\u201cHand over what you\u2019ve got and this will all go smoothly. And you!\u201d he focused his rage at me, \u201cdon't try to be a hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cWouldn't think of it.\u201d I choked.\n\n\u201cOh dear, there\u2019s no need.\u201d The old woman was talking to me, despite actively being mugged. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m here, of course!\u201d\n\nAnd then she grew. Her back straightened, and knees popped backwards. Fingers stretched and hardened into talons. Her clothes fell away to reveal leathery skin, and she regressed in age to early fifties. Wings, elegant and terrifying, rose from her back. She was at least eight feet tall.\n\nShe was beautiful.\n\nThe man who had so stupidly decided today was a good day to go mugging regained his mental functionality far faster than I did, and made a laughably futile attempt to run. As was to be expected, he made it about halfway through a turn before he was being raised into the air by one of the woman\u2019s gargantuan hands.\n\n\u201cPlease, dear, retain *some* dignity.\u201d\n\nHe did not. The moment he made eye contact with her he started screaming. To be fair, if I was on the wrong side of this woman\u2019s favor I would also be screaming.\n\nI looked around for someone else who witnessed what had just happened, or a business with a camera who I could beg for the footage later. I just\u2026 I wanted something else to show people. If I have proof I can tell others, if I have nothing, the things that keep happening to me will live only in my mind, and I don't think I\u2019m strong enough to hold them.\n\nShe sighed, and bit a chunk off of his head. There was a crunch, and a squelch, and she swallowed it in one fluid motion. She didn't bother to take more than the top half; everything from halfway up his nose and down was still there. His body twitched a few times, and then fell still.\n\n\u201cSuch a waste,\u201d she whined as she threw the rest of the man into the alley he came from prior. \u201cI would have offered it to you as well, but alas, raw flesh is not good for humans.\u201d\n\nShe reverted back into the form of the old woman and looked at me. \u201cMy dear, are you coming? That cat of yours must be so lonely by now.\u201d\n\nWhen I spoke my voice was strangled. \u201cOf course.\u201d","103":"The smoke spilled over her wrinkled, gray-fuzzed upper lip as she exhaled her cigarette; the yellow window she sat by illuminated her face in a sickly hue and made me feel bad about giving her the cigarette in the first place. \u201cThanks, Josh,\u201d she\u2019d say, when she undid the oxygen tube from her nostrils and draped the green translucent tube across her lap. No one was supposed to give her anything to smoke, her lungs were black, and she was dying because of it. But my grandmother\u2019s begging was unlike anyone else\u2019s, and I could not deny her any request, even when it was for her own good.\n\nIt was midday and we were waiting for her nurse. She had a nurse come by and check on her once a week\u2014every Tuesday\u2014because she was dying. Me and my grandmother lived together because of my parents. Two people with hearts full of wanderlust, it\u2019s only too bad that being traveling vagrants meant they eventually wandered past each other. So, it was my mom\u2019s mom that took care of me and now that she was too old to move around properly, I was taking care of her in the old house south of Hebbronville in Texas. We lived on a hill with old wisps of skinny weeds and a dead brown yard.\n\nA knock came on the door and my grandmother handed me the cigarette, wafting the smoke away from her face. Just as I snubbed the cigarette out into a soda can I\u2019d just polished off while she slipped into her tube. I answered the door and the nurse greeted me with a suspicious expression immediately.\n\n\u201cHave you been smoking?\u201d asked the nurse.\n\nI shook my head. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot you.\u201d She looked to the old woman in the recliner by the window. \u201cHer.\u201d\n\nMy grandmother, raspy voiced, answered, \u201cWhat\u2019s it matter? It\u2019s spread up my spine anyway. I don\u2019t have much time. Shouldn\u2019t I enjoy what little time I have left?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you suffocating in your sleep.\u201d The nurse pushed past me, and I moved into the kitchen for the washing up from lunch. I did the dishes and listened in on their conversation; it was the same as it always was. My grandmother fought the nurse over philosophical differences; that\u2019s how she would\u2019ve put it. But the nurse was being practical. It was the nurse\u2019s job to be practical. I didn\u2019t want her suffocating in her sleep either. I should\u2019ve thrown the smokes out. I should\u2019ve denied her that precious liberty.\n\nWhen the nurse was gone, I cooked us each a serving of grilled pork and corn. She was getting thinner; she was always getting thinner. Her appetite dwindled with each passing day and despite me trying to make her favorite foods, she hardly touched a thing beyond a can of potato sticks she kept by her recliner\u2014she might idly munch on those while watching The Price Is Right or NCIS.\n\nAs evening came, we sat around the back porch on the hill and watched the blue sky become purple then black and we talked about the stars. My grandmother was big on the new-age-constellation-hippie-crap that I never put much stock in, but she could trace them with her finger and point them out to me and I\u2019d sit absently by her. Truth be told, I always found space bleakly horrifying. A great expanse of nothingness without oxygen\u2014looking out at it was almost like suffocating. She coughed and hacked into her bony balled fist, and I helped her wobble back to the house. She was stronger. I remember that. How strong she used to be. When I was little, she could pick me up and then I could probably pick her up with how small she\u2019d gotten. I moved her through the living room and then to her bed in her room, and she sat hard on the edge of it, throwing back the blankets. She used to pray. She didn\u2019t do that anymore. Not at the end.\n\nAfter putting her to bed, I moved to the living room to sleep on the couch. I enjoyed falling asleep to the dull glow of the TV with the monotonous drone of infomercials.\n\nWhen I awoke again, it was to a blinding light and the first thought\u2014as ridiculous as it may be\u2014was that the TV had exploded. I shielded my eyes and sat up, seeing vibrating beams of concentrated light spill out from around the cracks of my grandmother\u2019s closed door. In a swift panic, thinking that perhaps the house was burning down, I rushed to the door, slammed into it, and spilled into the room to find something that is never easy to explain.\n\nThere, stripped, bisected, organs sitting next to her opened remains, was my grandmother. Standing over her were smooth, waxy-skinned aliens with a sheen across their globby foreheads that sloped away from slitted black eyes. They froze, looked at me, each one holding an unknown instrument; there were three, maybe five of the bastards circled around her bed; the light cut shadows harshly and made it difficult to tell. And there she was, eyes already removed, black holes staring up at the ceiling. It felt as though I might explode, my joints ached, and I wanted to scream, but as I opened my mouth to belt out something, anything, one of the things moved to stand in front of me and then there was only white light and nothing.\n\nI awoke once more on the couch, kicking a throw-blanket off me. It was bright, the yellow window by the recliner shone light harshly through it. I was sweating, there was a faint metallic tinge in the air. Gooseflesh sprang across my forearms as I bolted to my grandmother\u2019s door. Pushing through the door without twisting the handle, the wooden molding exploded away from the threshold and my shins immediately met the bed frame. I looked across the bed, fully made, seemingly untouched. There wasn\u2019t a stain\u2014not so much as an imprint to suggest that she\u2019d ever been there. Still, there was the strange odor\u2014a mixture between pennies and gas.\n\nHoping that it was all a dream, I moved through the house, making a racket as I went, screaming, \u201cHello? Where are you? Hello?\u201d over and over and over again. There came no answer. I stood out on the back porch and scanned the surrounding area from the hill, hoping to catch a glimpse of the woman that had raised me. There was nothing and no one. I was entirely alone.\n\nCupping my hands together, I circled the house many times, screeching till I was hoarse for something to make sense. But nothing did. I was at a loss and totally destroyed.\n\nOoze dripped from my nose, and I wiped at it only to find that it was a bright lime green color. I knelt in the grass and blew my nose hard, sending out a smattering of that viscus stuff down the front of my shirt. What had they done to me? I could only surmise that it was the stuff they\u2019d used to knock me out. But if they were going to do that, why hadn\u2019t they wiped my mind or something? Like in the movies. Or better yet, why had they not simply killed me?\n\nI sat among the dead grass and watched the lulling heads of heartleaf hibiscuses that saw me from their place in the garden against the porch. My vision glazed over, and I cried into my forearms as I tucked my head into my chest. Somewhere in the recesses of my mind, were the signals of a fight or flight response, but I was too tired, too distraught to care if they appeared from the sky at that moment and beamed me up\u2014if they even do that sort of thing.\n\nOnce I\u2019d collected myself enough to stand again, I moved to the house and called my mom, but only received the voicemail I\u2019d become accustomed with. I left a brief message telling her to call back and then phoned my dad. Same thing.\n\nWhat was I to do? Call the police and tell them my grandmother had been killed\u2014not only killed, but *collected*\u2014by aliens? I\u2019d be thrown in the slammer; I\u2019d be the first person they\u2019d accuse over her disappearance.\n\nI threw together a backpack of clothes and tossed them into the beat-up Ford pickup, pulling from the drive on the hill and meeting the brushland further out, my eyes always drifting up to the deep blue midday sky. Without purpose or direction, I drove until the gas tank was empty and then I filled it and drove some more until it was getting dark. There was an overwhelming sense of dread hanging over my head. Each airplane or jet or satellite I saw in the sky could\u2019ve been them returning to take me.\n\nWithout being conscious of it, I drove into Hebbronville and stopped at the Burger Barn, ordered a plain cheeseburger with fries, and stared at it. The waitress shot me concerned looks and it took me some time to realize why. I was still wearing the shirt with that green ooze down its front\u2014hard, crusted; trying to ignore this, I focused on the meal. Because that\u2019s what people do. They focus on their meal. They act totally normal. They don\u2019t latch onto the nearest passerby and tell them about how aliens are real and how they\u2019re coming to take our grandmas. That would\u2019ve been too much. So, I focused on my meal.\n\nI took a knife and sliced the burger down its middle to expose a pinkish center and almost lost the bile in my stomach remembering the way they\u2019d opened her up. There I was, doing the same\u2014I could\u2019ve, if I so chose, placed the lettuce, the pickles, the patty, each piece, to the side and examine them clinically. I pushed the plate away and nibbled at the edge of a crispy fry while sipping on a Dr Pepper.\n\nAfter trying to urge myself to eat more, I excused myself to the bathroom to wash my face and possibly my shirt. Some guy stepped from the stall and the tile room smelled like stale feces as he caught the swinging door in my hand and moved past me. I went to the mirror, running water from the faucet. Splashing cool water on my face helped hardly at all. I swiped it through my hair and told myself to get a grip. None of it was real. Of course not. That\u2019s not how real life works. I looked at my shirt and sighed.\n\nI tried scraping the gunk from the shirt and in doing so, I caught a glimpse of my left eye in the murky mirror. There was something red there. For the briefest of moments. Not red tissue, but a bright red light splintering through my vision. It blinked for a split second and then it was gone completely. I hissed through my teeth and leaned in closer to the mirror, pulling down at the skin on my cheek bone to see my whole eye at once\u2014or at least as much as that would afford.\n\nI kept both eyes open and watched, holding my breath. Then something red blinked. It splintered through my watered vision, and I rubbed my eye. It wasn\u2019t that something was shining *at* my eye. Something was shining *through* my eye from *behind* it. I chewed my tongue. Had they implanted me with something? Were they tracking me? Was I like cattle to them? Would they someday snatch me up? It blinked again and I could feel it. It felt like the thump of my own increasing heartrate. Or perhaps I was overreacting, and it only seemed that way.\n\nIt was possible I was suffering from a psychotic break, but did people suffering from that even have the wherewithal to know what was happening? Gripping the edges of the porcelain sink, it felt solid and real, and I knew I wasn\u2019t making things up; something was very awry.\n\nUpon my return, the waitress was standing near my table\u2014it was possible that she thought I might dine and dash; I nodded and smiled and slid into the booth. I wasn\u2019t myself, after all. I probably seemed a smidge erratic. After paying and tipping, I drove myself to Dial Hardware to purchase a few knives and a standard boxcutter. Once I\u2019d collected these things, I went out to the Garden Inn and got a room; standing out in the cool air of the evening while I grabbed my pack from the pickup, I could not help but to flinch at the darkening sky. Every light from above felt like a trap. Somehow, I knew they were tracking me, following me; they were probably looking at me right then and I couldn\u2019t tell it.\n\nI went to my room and double checked that it was locked then moved to the bathroom to look over myself once more. Holding open the left eye, I watched, and it blinked that red color. There was something back there.\n\nRipping through the packaging of the boxcutter, I placed a razor blade in it and held it up to the soft tissue just beneath my left eye. I felt that blink again, like an electric hum in my brain. My chest was heaving, and I stopped, punching the counter. \u201cFuck.\u201d The room was spinning, and I removed my shirt. I stood in front of the mirror, pale chested, totally transfixed on the metal blade across the bottom of my eye.\n\nWithout having a moment to question myself further, I moved my arm in one swift motion and clenched my teeth so hard it felt like they might splinter from my mouth. Blood shot across the mirror and the blink came again, I circled the blade through groans\u2014muffled screams\u2014sliding directly around my eye socket till I felt the point pressed against bone and pulled the lids away in running flaps. I hovered my head over the sink and looked down with my one functioning eyeball; I had pissed myself. The next part would be worse. I took one of the larger knives I\u2019d bought from the hardware store and pushed it into the bottom of the eye like a crowbar and prodded it from its resting place until it fell into the sink, destroyed, hardly resembling more than a squished blood clot except for the torn ocular nerve running from it.\n\nI washed my face down, removing the excess blood. It blinked and I saw it with my right eye, but only briefly; reaching into the socket with my slippery fingers, I felt the bulbous end of something hard. Pinching it between my forefinger and thumb, I tugged until the tugging was more ripping than anything else. I felt it dislodge and a long metallic tube clanged into the sink. On the end of the tube was a blinking red ball. In a fit of adrenaline, I threw it on the floor and stomped it under my shoe then sat on the edge of the bathtub. Blood kept coming. I took a towel and packed my left eye socket before sliding into the bathtub.\n\nThe air smelled worse as minutes ticked by, the thick blood made me nauseous, but I somehow did not throw up.\n\nMy heart raced and the tremendous sharp pain became a tremendous throb instead. There was a thump. And another and another and I listened to my heartbeat, willing my eye socket to clot properly so I wouldn\u2019t bleed out.\n\nThen it came. It fell into rhythm, the same as before. I *felt* it. And there was a hardly noticeable red in my vision. I stopped and looked at the thing I\u2019d crushed in the floor. Its remains were still there. In a burst, I slipped from the tub and pulled myself up to the scabbing sink to see what I saw with my one good eye.\n\nThere it was.\n\nA blinking red light.\n\nBehind my right eye.\n\n[Site](https:\/\/lucaswhorley.wordpress.com\/)\n\n[Sub](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Edwardthecrazyman\/)\n\n[TCC](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TheCrypticCompendium\/)","104":"As you may remember from [my first story](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/pkd0c2\/im_a_private_detective_and_it_almost_got_me_killed\/), I used to be a police officer in the UK. Whilst moving house recently, I found an old box of cassette tapes. Yes, cassette tapes. Even as late as 2014, we were still using old fashioned cassettes to record our suspect interviews in our crumbling, old police stations.\n\nIn case you don\u2019t know how things work in the UK (or did ten years ago) I\u2019ll explain. The police generally don\u2019t have guns. In Britain, we generally police \u2018by consent\u2019 and will arrest people only when necessary. If a crime has occurred, and you suspect that person of committing it, then you can arrest them and take them to a police station - BUT - only if it\u2019s necessary. Necessary is a broad term, but it generally means if there\u2019s still a lot of investigating still to be done, such as a statements from witnesses or evidence to be gathered.\n\nAnyway, once arrested a person gets taken to the nearest police station with custody cells and they get booked in. They then get free legal advice and are interviewed. Those interviews, back in my time, were done in small rooms with a cassette machine. The machines held 2 tapes, one was the original that got sealed up and the other was a copy from which more copies were made. I always made a spare copy for myself as tapes were known to go missing. It also helped to have a tape for when we typed up our court reports and transcripts.\n\nOver the years, I interviewed a lot of people. Some of the crimes were really petty; we arrested people for making threats on Facebook or stealing chocolate. But, some crimes were really awful, as you can imagine. A lot of the time, we interviewed by ourselves; just me and the bad guy (and it usually was a guy). My tapes got put in a box, and almost never got opened again. I decided to go through the box and reminisce on old times. I still have a cassette player, of course, I\u2019m an old dude now.\n\nPlaying back a tape, I was met with the usual screeching beep - the indicator that the tapes were recording. There was no video in those rooms, not where I worked. There is probably CCTV in every room now with recordings saved to hard drives, but just ten years ago it really was a crappy old cassette system. The beep stopped and I heard the usual drone that started Every . Single. Interview.\n\n\u201cI am PC \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* and this interview is being recorded at \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* police station. The time by the interview clock is 9:39am and the date is January 3rd 2009. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given as evidence\u2026\u201d\n\nThe intro to interviews usually took a few minutes at least, but we had a running joke at one point to see who could do the shortest interview from start to finish. Not very professional, but we had to take the fun where we could find it. One colleague, Mike, managed to interview a shoplifter from start to finish including all of the formal spiel in just 3 minutes. He must have raced through it at a crazy speed, I\u2019m sure that if the suspect contested it at court then the whole tape would have been thrown out!\n\nAnyway, this tape wasn\u2019t like that. In fact, it was more than one tape. I remember the dude sat across from me. He\u2019d declined a solicitor, refused a phone call, didn\u2019t want anything to eat or drink. He just sat there, smiling at me. He\u2019d been arrested in the middle of the night by other officers for assault.\n\nI came in at 7am and was told to take over the prisoner\u2019s processing; which really meant to interview him and try to charge him with something.\n\nThe interview went very normally at first. I did my bit in the introduction, explaining the alleged crime, his rights and the purpose of the interview. I had my interview plan, topics to talk about and challenges ready. I started as I always did, with a very open, \u201cPlease tell me about your day\u201d type question and let him talk. Oh yeah. He talked.\n\nIt was part of our training not to interrupt a suspect when they were talking. Instead, we were to try to summarise what they\u2019d said and break it down into relevant topics that we would then probe. It was called the PEACE model: plan, engage, ask, challenge, evaluate. I was good at it. But this interview really started to annoy me early on. He rambled and rambled about what time he got up, the clothing he chose, his breakfast, which then span off into a tangent about where he bought his cereal and the people at the supermarket. Eventually, I had to step in.\n\n\u201cOkay, okay, I get all that, but we\u2019re here to talk about the behaviour that lead to your arrest. I want you to tell me about that. What happened before you were arrested? What were you doing? Describe your thoughts and actions.\u201d I said, exasperated. It wasn\u2019t a professional question, it was many questions in one and could potentially be picked apart in court by a clever lawyer who wanted to argue that I was being confusing. Nevertheless, he started talking again. He wasn\u2019t annoyed by my interruption or obvious patronising instructions. He smiled, with a genuine grin that reached his eyes and made them sparkle. He was really enjoying the attention.\n\n\u201cFine, fine, sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to be helpful. So, basically, I was in the bar having a drink and went to speak to a few ladies. They weren\u2019t really chatty, so I went and stood back by the bar. I guess they were embarrassed or felt shy or something. So, when the redhead got up and walked to the bar by herself, I started chatting to her. She got really rude and pushed me away. I told her that wasn\u2019t a very nice thing to do and she swore at me. I told her that she ought to be careful who she spoke to like that. There are some horrible people around. She thought I meant me, and called the police. I decided that I didn\u2019t want to wait for the police and waste their time. I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. So, I left the bar, walked down the street and that\u2019s when of your fine colleagues stopped me and arrested me. I think the woman ought to be fined for wasting police time.\u201d\n\nI was cringing inside. This guy was a real creep. Smarmy, slimy, smiley, full of himself; basically thought that butter wouldn\u2019t melt. I felt really uncomfortable looking at him, but I kept my face neutral and gave my usual professional interview. I thanked him for his account, summarised it and then dove into the specifics, such as his intentions and actions, etcetera. The interview went on for a couple of tapes and eventually, I returned him to his cell.\n\nNow, the next part of the process, which some people don\u2019t realise, is that we - the police - don\u2019t usually make the decisions. We need to take all the information we have (witness statements, interview summary, 3rd party witness accounts, and so on) and put it together in a file that goes to the big boys: The CPS; the crown prosecution service. A lawyer reviews it, asks a few questions and usually gives a decision on it.\n\nIn this case, based on the fact that a few people gave witness statements to back up the victim\u2019s point of view, they decided to charge the guy with threatening behaviour and assault. I told him the charge, did the process and never saw him again. That usually happened. Once someone was charged, unless we had to give evidence at court, we might never see or hear anything about that person again. This dude:  - I\u2019ve never heard about him since and had pretty much forgotten the whole thing. He might be creepy, but I used to meet a lot of creepy people.\n\nSo, you know his point of view of what happened, but you also know he got charged with a couple of things, so I\u2019ll explain the incident from the real point of view according to witnesses:\n\nThe dude was in the bar, by himself, drinking bottled alcopops. You know the kind: the sweet, fruity colourful bottles of 4% alcohol that are basically designed for teenagers. He had been in the bar from about 8pm, when it was really quiet. Around 9:30pm, a group of women come in and sit around a circular table for a girl\u2019s team night out. There were four women, all in their 20s, all fairly slim and attractive. None of them were single and none of them were looking for male attention. Still, as often happens, a few guys offered to buy them drinks or tried to start a conversation, which they politely declined and nothing bad happened.\n\nThen, some time between 10 and 10:30pm, the victim, Charlotte, walked up to the bar. She claimed that he had not previously been to their table, but might have done, as a few people had during the night. No issues there. However, she claimed that he then stood next to her at the bar and told her that she was just his type: he \u201cloved a leggy blonde\u201d and offered to take her home. She declined and tried to ignore him, but he didn\u2019t take the hint. He started rubbing her elbow (goodness knows what that is supposed to achieve) and started repeating a sentence like a mantra.\n\n\u201cYou need what I\u2019ve got to give,\u201d he repeated, over and over again, still rubbing her elbow. She pulled away and told him to get lost. He tried to touch her again so she pulled out her phone and started to call 999. The creep left the bar, but thanks to his description being given in great detail, he was stopped just a few minutes by officers patrolling the area and then arrested. Charlotte\u2019s account was corroborated by a few witnesses, so he was charged. End of story (for me).\n\nI never got called to court for that job, which wasn\u2019t unusual - as I said - and I never heard about it again, so never gave it another thought. It\u2019s a sad truth that in the early 2000\u2019s, as it is today, that women get harassed in bakers every day without fail. They rarely report it, but I think they should.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m digressing again. After listening to the tape and thinking about the creep, knowing what we know today about the rate of offending that sex pests like him are up to, I decided to do some digging. I wanted to know if he\u2019d been up to no good since. Using my contacts, I got them to do a check on his name and nothing much came back. It turns out he wasn\u2019t convicted of that assault case. I guess it got thrown out at court due to witnesses not turning up. I wasn\u2019t happy with this, so decided to look into it further. The tape was good as I\u2019d referred to his name as well as the names of all the witnesses, so I decided to investigate each one. The results made me feel sick with worry and anxiety.\n\nIt turns out that the main victim ended up being reported as a missing person just a week before the case was due to go to trial. She went on another night out with friends, went their separate ways at the end in taxis, but she never responded to her friends\u2019 text messages afterwards. Her phone was not recovered and she has not been seen from since. She\u2019s still listed as a missing person and there\u2019s no evidence to pursue that the police didn\u2019t already check.\n\nThey followed up with the local taxi firms, but no records of her were ever made. It\u2019s technically illegal to pick someone up in a taxi that isn\u2019t pre-booked (except for those larger \u2018black cabs\u2019) but people always jump into a taxi at 1am on a Saturday night and pay over the odds for a lift home. The danger with it is that anyone can pretend to be a taxi. Especially nowadays with unmarked Uber cars and other ride apps.\n\nThings got even more scary when I started tracking down her friends. I started with the names of those who were registered as witnesses for the original court case. It turns that 2 out of the 3 that gave statements are also currently missing. Missing in the real sense that they disappeared without a trace: no phone, no messages, no body, no financial withdrawals, and no sign of an adequate police investigation.\n\nHow can this be? How can 3 women, all friends, go missing without a trace in the space of a year of each other yet barely anything has been done? Well, it turns out that one of them is in a different police force area, which means they don\u2019t have information about any links. The other 2 were both within my force\u2019s border, but 2 unrelated women with no police record don\u2019t flag up on the system. The police don\u2019t know who\u2019s friends with who all the time, and most missing people aren\u2019t really investigated very well until it becomes obvious that it\u2019s extremely serious. By then, evidence has been lost, leads reduced and communication breaks down. It\u2019s sad but true.\n\nI did my best to try and talk to different people at the different forces, but they weren\u2019t giving much away - or they had very little to give. I couldn\u2019t believe that 3 women had disappeared who knew each other could be a coincidence. So, I was left with no option but to track down the common link between. Our Mr Creep. It turns out that he was virtually unblemished in terms of police contact - no convictions, no drunk driving, no petty offences, just that one arrest and charge.\n\nPeople who harass and touch up women don\u2019t just do it once, so this guy had obviously become a more careful operator. I found his address and started following him one day. He worked in a regular office, doing regular hours, wore a regular suit, drove a regular car and had a regular routine. However, he wasn\u2019t a regular guy. He was smart; suspicious it seems.\n\nThe second time I followed him, he pretended to break down on the side of the road, and as I slowly passed him, he waved - beckoning me to pull over, so I did. No point pretending, I thought. I got out of the car and walked back to where he was stood. It was a public road so I didn\u2019t anticipate any trouble.\n\n\u201cHello, piggy,\u201d he began, wearing that unforgettable creepy grin. \u201cHow can I assist you today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a police officer,\u201d I replied, which was technically the truth these days.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut, you used to be. I remember your face very clearly, little pig. One doesn\u2019t forgot something as life-altering as being locked up in a cell and interviewed at a police station. No, no no. You\u2019ve been indelibly marked in my brain for quite some time. I often think of you.\u201d\n\nI felt very cold all of a sudden. He was not the same, polite and friendly person that he appeared to be back during the interview. He was grinning, but it suddenly looked very evil, rather than welcoming. His smile stretched his cheeks and almost reached from ear to ear, exposing perfect white teeth. The smile of a wolf.\n\nHe continued, \u201cYou\u2019re following me. I don\u2019t like it. I am telling you to stop. Consider this a one-time warning.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d I asked, cloaking myself with fake confidence and standing up as straight as my aching back would allow.\n\n\u201cYes, quite frankly,\u201d came his brazen response. \u201cI am making it very clear that you neither have the authority, nor the reason, to be following me. I don\u2019t take kindly to being antagonised. So, please be a lovely little piggy and run away - for your own good.\u201d\n\nHe continued to grin. Anyone watching from the road would think we were friends chatting, but his smile did not reach his eyes. They were like a shark\u2019s: dark, dead, empty, disinterested. I considered my response before speaking, and carefully whispered.\n\n\u201cI know who you are. I know where you live. I know what you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d He interrupted, \u201cI very much doubt that, or we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation. Although, you must be following me a reason. Would you care to share?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a psychopath,\u201d I stated. \u201cYou\u2019re good at pretending to be a nice guy, but you\u2019re clearly dead inside. You\u2019re responsible for 3 missing women and I\u2019m going to prove it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s absurd. I\u2019m an upstanding member of the community. I pay my taxes, recycle my bottles and donate to charity. I\u2019m leaving now. You know what not to do now. Goodbye.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. He was so comfortable with the accusation, and so arrogant in his response. He just strolled the few steps to his car, got in and started the ignition. I stared at him, daggers would fly from my eyes if they could. Just when I thought he was about to drive off, he brought his window down and looked at me, clearly waiting for me to approach. I put my head near to the window and nodded, encouraging him to say whatever he had to say. He merely whispered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more than 3.\u201d\n\nThen, he drove away.\n\nI immediately felt sick. Sick, humiliated, angry, in slight shock and disbelief. This was not how it was supposed to go. He was supposed to be afraid of me, but now I felt extremely vulnerable. Everything at the police station, on tape, on CCTV in the corridors and the cells was an act. He was not as smarmy and such an obvious creep after all. He was cold, calculating, confident and callous. I had no doubt that he would have dropped my body in a ditch if he could get away with it.\n\nI went back to the office, had a few drinks and made a few more phone calls. I asked former colleagues about missing women of a certain age and description. It seems that in our force area alone - and there are more than 40 forces in the UK - there had been over 6000 reports of missing people: nearly 20 a day. So, nationally, that would be about 700 per day. Apparently, only 1% never turn up. That sounded low, until I realised that meant 2,500 people a year basically disappear in the UK. I was staggered. How could so many people disappear without a trace. Sometimes bodies turned up in rivers, refuges and hospitals but there are still hundreds upon hundreds of people that just vanish.\n\nThis was unacceptable! My blood ran cold just thinking about it. Mr Creep might have been lying to me, but I didn\u2019t believe that. I think he\u2019s quite proud of that fact that he\u2019s making people disappear. I needed to go home.\n\nI walked out of the door and drove straight home. I walked in the front door, locked it behind me and poured a stiff drink. I fell asleep on the sofa with the TV on, slipping into a grim, yet realistic dream.\n\nIn the dream, I was in an infinitely large room. There were no floors or walls. It was completely black. However, there was a dining table in the middle, as if standing on an invisible floor. Mr Creep was stood next to it, looking at me, grinning his never ending smile. Suddenly, the body of a women was lying on the table. She was naked, pale and had long, auburn hair. Mr Creep ran a finger over her ribs. I tried to walk forward, but I was unable to move my legs.\n\nHe stroked her hair, and ran his hand down her shoulder. He caressed her arm, then starting stroking her elbows. It was weird but so real at the same time. He never stopped grinning. With one hand he carried on stroking her elbow, and with the other he started to stab with a short, sharp knife that randomly appeared between his fingers. There was no fury or pace to his assault, just a repeated stabbing motion at every reachable body part. Sometimes he looked at her body, sometimes he looked at me - grinning - but continued to stab, stab, stab. Blood covered her body, painting it deep red, and more blood dripped from the table, falling into the infinite void.\n\nI woke up, feeling clammy and sick. I was groggy but realised where I was: sat on my sofa in front of a playing TV. I noticed a movement to my right, glanced and after a second of slow-sleepy-brain-processing realised it was a man. It was him.\n\n\u201cJesus!\u201d I shouted, and tried to stand up on my still-groggy legs.\n\n\u201cNo no,\u201d he said, pulling on my jumper to keep me sat. I noticed that he was holding a small, sharp knife, not unlike the one in my dream. He wasn\u2019t pointing it at me, just holding it and resting it on his knee. It was an implied threat, rather than an explicit one. I got the point.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to check that my message had not fallen on dumb, piggy ears,\u201d he said, calmly, quietly and still grinning - although the grin had receded slightly. I didn\u2019t reply. \u201cYes. I just wanted to ensure that you weren\u2019t going to be annoying and try something again. I was being honest with you; I really do not want to see you again. I do not expect any trouble. Clearly, I can find you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get in my house?\u201d Was all I could say.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s more of a bungalow, really, but that\u2019s for me to know and you to never find out.\u201d His grin disappeared completely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been having a lot of fun since I first saw you those years ago. I have no intention of giving it up. It\u2019s become increasingly that you and your piggy friends are completely incompetent and never talk to each other, so please maintain that approach and we\u2019ll get along swimmingly. Now, stay there.\u201d\n\nAnd, with that, he stood up, replaced the grin and walked out of the door. I just stared at the space he\u2019d vacated, still groggy and totally dumbfounded. This would not do. I had to do something and there was only one person I could think of that would be in a position to help: [Anya](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/pkd0c2\/im_a_private_detective_and_it_almost_got_me_killed\/)\n\nI was hoping never to see her again, and she\u2019d made it clear that we were never to cross paths. However, this was insane. How many psychopaths are there in the country, just walking around looking normal and acting like actual human beings? I had to choose the lesser of two evils. Well, she was really the worst of all evil as far as I had seen, but she might just be willing to spend some time with Mr Creep.\n\nI just had to hope that she was a more dangerous psychopath than he was.","105":"[Part 1](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qolzd7\/lesters_game\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n*Lester was born in 1887. He wouldn't divulge where to me yet, but that wasn't too important anyway. For by telling me he was born... he gave away the fact that he was indeed human. Or at least, he used to be. Needless to say, his age certainly explains his choice of wardrobe, but you'd think somewhere along the way he'd have thought to put a fucking toupee over that god damn head of his! Seriously! I can almost see my reflection in that thing!*\n\n\"Are you quite finished!?\" Lester scorned impatiently at me as I wrote. \"You know you can write down as much as you want, but it's all worthless to you until you've passed the second and third game. That is... if you still want to continue...\"\n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw his mouth twist into a subtle smirk.\n\nAdmirably, after what id just gone through in the first game, I wasn't super excited. Couldn't let him know that though.\n\n\"Alright, Dickhead!\" I said with a smile. \"What's the next one!\"\n\nHe smiled. \"The next game you will play is the game of temptation...\"\n\nLester gestured to the wall behind me which had once again eroded away. Instead of the dark stone halls, I'd seen before though, the entrance now opened to a lush bright forest. Various trees and plants clustered around a single dirt path.\n\n\"The rules are simple.\" Lester continued. \"Simply follow the path until you reach the trail's end. No matter what you hear, no matter what you see, you must never leave the trail.\"\n\nI look up to see him smiling with undeserved pride.\n\n\"Wow!\" I exclaimed. \"It's almost like it's the EXACT SAME FUCKING GAME!\"\n\nHis expression quickly changed. \"What... how... no this is completely different I assure...\"\n\n\"NAH NAH NAH NAH The path is my candle and the creepy things are hiding in the forest and the goal is to go from point A to point fucking B! Only this time it's ridiculously fucking easier! Jesus fucking christ Lester! You told me you've been around for what!? Well over a hundred years??? And THIS is all the creativity you fucking have!?\"\n\n\"I don't think you will find this easier.\" Lester nearly growled.\n\n\"Yeah, whatever. Later Dickhead!\" I said, turning to stroll through that door.\n\n\"Oh not yet ya don't!\" He grabbed me by the collar and yanked me back into the room.\n\n\"WOW HEY!\"\n\n\"NO BOOZE THIS TIME!\"\n\n\"LESTER! LESTER GOD FUCKING DAMN IT!\"\n\nI tried to fight him but Lester as it turns out is incredibly fucking strong. With one hand he flat out lifted me off the ground and used his other arm to start rooting through my pockets. He tore out my notes, my phone, my knife, my flashlight, my pen, my other knife...\n\n\"DID YOU GO TO SLEEP CARRYING A FUCKING UTILITY BELT!?\" He yelled in annoyance!\n\n\"SCOUTS CODE! BE PREPARED YOU WANNA BE WARLOCK!\"\n\nFinally, he grasped it and threw me to the ground.\n\n\"Okay wait, wai-wai-wai-wait!\" I stammered. \"Lester. Buddy! If I don't have that on me, I can actually start going crazy! Seriously! It's not like I'm going to set the forest on fire or something! It keeps me grounded man! Please!\"\n\nHe grinned.\n\n\"No.\" He said, and then kicked me out the door.\n\n\\-\n\nI blinked. I was laying down in the middle of the dirt path. The room and Lester had seemingly just vanished into thin air this time. I groaned, lifted myself to my feet, and stared down the path ahead.\n\n*Just a fucking walk in the woods.* I thought to myself.\n\nThe sky was bright, the fauna was mostly lush green with a few flowers and mushrooms standing out amongst the brush. As a began to move forward. I started noticing the occasional beetle, or butterfly, making its way. Then I began to hear the birds chirping.\n\nAs I continued moving forward, this thing nearly flew into my face. Mistaking it for just another bug I was about to swat it away, when, upon taking a closer look I held my hand. The thing definitely had characteristics of a bug, chitin green body, dragonfly wings, those undeveloped shitty eyes of a thousand little hexagons. It also had two legs, two arms, a torso, and when I looked at its face, it smiled at me.\n\nWith its two little arms, it beckoned me forward. I request I humored until we reached the edge of the path. When it realized I had stopped I quickly zoomed back around and once again hovered in front of me, motioning for me to continue.\n\nI slapped my hands together and smushed the fucker!\n\nHeheheheheh, gonna have to do better than THAT Les- OH SHIT!\n\nSuddenly a thousand pissed-off little dickheads came swarming out of the bush! Flying right for me!\n\nNow, I'm not typically afraid of bugs, a swarm of bugs, maybe, a swarm of angry, unknown, possibly intelligent- Okay, I ran out of there like a little bitch.\n\nTook me an embarrassing amount of time to remember per Lesters rules I was safe while I was on the path.\n\nAfter I calmed down they proceeded to just swarm around me for an annoying amount of time before FINALLY giving up and flying back off into whatever little part of hell in that forest they came from.\n\nMoving in, a familiar lovely smell hit my nose. The smell of Liquor! Somewhere off the path, a stream of smoke could be seen rising out of the trees. Almost like someone was cooking moonshine out there!\n\nA good move, but predictable Lester.\n\nI moved on.\n\nAs I journey further and further along the trail, I began to come across more and more unusual things.\n\nA tree with leaves of written pages, just visible through a crack in the fauna. A cabin barely visible, its structure made of gold. A humanoid steam-work colossus, standing dead in the pines. A plant whose fruit was tiny bags of what looked like cocaine. A group of women, dancing naked around a fire. The smell of cookies...\n\nEverything caught my eye. I was here to document, but nothing pushed me to leave the trail. Nothing... until I heard her voice. I wasn't even sure it was her at first, but she kept calling, pleading for help.\n\nI called back, and she screamed my name.\n\nI should have known it was a trick. Thinking back, I think kinda did know, but I couldn't risk it. Shamefully I came to my senses way too late.\n\nShe kept calling me. First, it seemed just a bit more to the left. then a bit more to the right. It wasn't until her voice was coming from behind me, that I realized how far off the path I'd ran. Every direction was like looking into a kaleidoscope. Endless trees, ferns, bushes with no discernable way of recalling where I'd came from.\n\n\"no no No NO NO!!!\" I shouted angrily out into nothing. All the while, her voice continued to taunt me.\n\nI felt defeated. Helpless. This was it. this is exactly what Lester wanted.\n\nIt wasn't until I heard the buzzing, that my perspective changed. The buzzing of that hoard of wanna-be imps that pestered me nearly as soon as I walked through that door because even if I had been fucking played, there was no way I was DYING to those FUCKING PIXIES!\n\nI tore two sticks off a tree and stripped a handful of dead leaves from the forest floor. And I took those sticks and I started rubbing em! I REALLY started fucking rubbing em! Meanwhile, that god damn buzz buzz kept getting closer and closer! BUT I KEPT FUCKING RUBBING IT!\n\nFinally, I saw the first spark. Then another, smoke was slowly coming from the leaves now.\n\nI looked up, just in time to see the hoard emerging through the brush. And I smiled.\n\n\"Scouts code MotherFuckers!\" I exclaimed gleefully! \"FIRE TIME!\"\n\n\\-\n\nNow I didn't know exactly what direction I'd came from but I had a fairly good idea of how far I had moved. Once you've managed to light the fucking forest on fire that's a pretty significant signal to tell you your point of origin. This way? nope. Back to the fire. That way? Nah. Back to the fire! How about this- Ahhhh! There's the path!\n\nLester simply stared at me with a vacant expression as I strutted my way back into the room. The fire spreading evermore behind my back. I expected him to be pissed, but he seemed unsurprised.\n\n\"What was her name?\" His question caught me off guard.\n\n\"What?\" I stammered.\n\n\"The girl in the woods, the one you ran after.\" He was smiling now. \"What was her name?\"\n\nI glared at him. \"You already know her fucking name.\" I hissed.\n\nhe began to crackle. \"Oh, my Sawyer! And to think you were implying I was cliche! She's one of the ones that never returned if I recall!\"\n\nHe calmly took his seat at the table.\n\n\"So tell me,\" He grinned. \"Now that I know why you're really here. Why not make the request to kill me. Why not ask me to bring her back? Why... all the questions and all this other shit?\"\n\nI took a seat.\n\n\"I already told you,\" I said with my best smile. \"It's just more fun this way!\"\n\n[Part 3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nosleep\/comments\/qrj6vc\/lesters_game_part_3\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)","106":"Teaching driver's ed was supposed to be an easy job. Like any job, it has its stressful moments, but I was always pretty relaxed about everything. But what happened on Jefferson Road managed to make even me nervous. \n\nMy student that night was Jordan McKellar. An 18-year-old senior and a quiet kid like me when I was younger, it was only his second class with me. But I could tell he was a good driver. Focused and steady. \n\nIt was the middle of November, so it was already getting dark out when his session was scheduled. It was a beautiful day out, a crisp blue sky that made the bright orange leaves vividly stick out. But as it got darker the weather got at least 10 degrees colder, and the faint wind made the leaves rustle wherever they fell. \n\nAs usual, we were driving steadily down back roads because those are the best places for new drivers to learn.  After about 10 minutes, we came to a four-way intersection with a road closed barricade across the road I usually have students learn on, so I had Jordan take a right to follow the proposed detour. We followed it as it wound up and down various back roads until we came across more detours and by the time they all ended, we were staring at the sign for Jefferson Road. \n\nJordan stopped the car and looked at me. He didn't say a word, but I knew what he was thinking. The same thing I was thinking. \n\nJefferson Road was the kind of road people talk about in hushed voices and the kind of road people dared each other to walk down alone at night. Its reputation preceded it. A 4-mile-long trek with minimal lighting, no gas stations, and unwieldy turns in places, the reputation is in part based on things that have happened over the years. People have gone missing here and never been found, while other times police have searched the woods and found any number of ominous things. \n\nOne time when I was spending the night at my friend Ethan's house, he told me that his cousin was driving one night on Jefferson Road, and he swore that he saw what looked like a cult doing some ritual in the woods. That night was also one of the times his dad yelled at us to go to bed. We were always driving him crazy with how late we stayed up and played video games. \n\n\"Well, I guess we have to go down Jefferson Road.\" I eventually said. \u201cAll the other main roads are cut off, or local traffic only.\u201d\n\n\"Ok,\" Jordan nodded before he put the car in gear and started down the road. If he was nervous, he didn\u2019t show it. \n\nWhile Jordan began the journey down the road, I leaned back in my seat and made sure to stay alert. The few streetlights cast an ominous orange glow over the faded black pavement. Although most of the trees near the street had no leaves left on them, the rest of the area was buffeted by thick pine trees that went on for miles. The kind of woods that are an ideal place for people up to no good. \n\nAnyone who teaches driver's ed or has some road related job knows how roads affect human behavior on a massive scale. Certain roads decide not only what houses people buy and what businesses thrive, it decides what cities thrive and what cities struggle. I wasn't afraid of Jefferson Road per say, but I was wary. Just like I'm wary of many roads and areas based on their history, layout, and the road conditions. Everyone encounters car trouble at some point, but there are definitely places that you don't want to have any sort of car issue around. People have been telling stories about scary things happening on roads for ages because scary things have been happening on roads for ages. Jefferson Road was just one more road like that. \n\nThe drive had been inconsequential for a while when Jordan drove around a bend and the headlights illuminated a road closed sign up ahead in the distance. \n\n\"What do I do?\" \n\n\"Keep going. Ignore it.\"\n\n\"Ignore it?\"\n\n\"Yes. If the road was actually closed, the sign would've been right at the start of the road.\"\n\n\"Ok.\" But I could tell he was nervous. And understandably so. Either someone forgot to move the sign, or someone was up to something. And I didn't think someone had forgotten it. The sign was also old, so there was no way it had sat here that long forgotten. \n\nI took a deep breath and silently repeated the cardinal rule of teaching someone to drive. Remain calm and never yell or scream. Because yelling and making someone who's already nervous driving even more nervous is a recipe for literal disaster. Besides, this was excellent training for Jordan. In this day and age, the odds of someone coming across something like this was frighteningly common and I'd much rather he learn to deal with this with a trained adult and not when he was alone in the middle of nowhere. \n\nI flashed what I hoped was a reassuring smile. \"Just keep doing what you normally would do. Don't stop and stay focused. Just like any other road.\" \n\n\"Ok,\" he said as he carefully drove on and the sign got closer. \"But what if someone jumps in front of the car?\" \n\n\"Don't worry about it.\"\n\n\"Seriously?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\" \n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"A car weighs far more than a person. And it travels a lot faster. If someone is up to no good and they jump in front of your car, the only way they win is if you slam on the brakes and suddenly swerve to avoid them. That usually causes the driver to crash, which means you\u2019re stranded here and at the mercy of whoever or whatever is out there. But if you keep going, they have no choice but to jump out of the way, or let you plow right into them. Do you know which one it tends to be?\"\n\n\"They jump out of the way.\"\n\n\"Very good. I'm glad this came up because it's very important. Unless there's some massive barricade that you can't get around, do not swerve or anything like that if someone tries to stop your car late at night in the middle of nowhere. But aside from that, when you're driving at night, alone, and there's not anyone around, use logic. If something seems off or doesn't make sense, proceed with caution.\" \n\n\"Ok.\"\n\n\"Driving is a lot like life; if you stay focused, try to keep calm, and use your head, you'll do just fine.\" \n\n\"Thanks Mr. Allen, that actually makes a lot of sense.\" \n\n\"I can't tell you how many irresponsible students I get. People who are just generally an accident waiting to happen. That's not you. You're smart, attentive, and I can tell you're responsible. I have no worries about you.\" \n\n\"Thank you, that really means a lot to me.\" \n\n\"You're a smart guy, so I suspect you already know this, but the key to driving is that it's not yourself you have to pay attention to. It's everything and everyone else. It's another thing that's just like life. If you pay close attention to what's going on around you, you'll do ok. Do you know why I didn't have you turn around and go back?\"\n\n\"No, why?\"\n\n\"Because there's no guarantee we'd be able to get out. If someone planted that sign, they clearly want whoever is driving to turn around and go back. This is a long road, which means there is plenty of time for someone watching down by the sign to let their buddies out by the road's entrance know that someone is coming and block that entrance. Then whoever drove back would be trapped.\"\n\n\"That does make a lot of sense.\" \n\n\"Sniffing out trouble when driving is all about context. If a road is officially closed, you can tell. Plus they warn you in advance and leave you a way to go around.\u201d \n\nWhat I didn't say was that I was worried about what might be waiting for us since we didn't turn around like the sign said. I carefully watched as Jordan smoothly passed the road closed sign and I kept looking around. Aside from the trees surrounding us on all sides, there was nothing and no one around. But the longer I sat there, the more uneasy I felt. I was painfully aware that the car\u2019s driver's ed sign was a message to anyone up to no good that the driver of the car was probably not very experienced. Which is not something you want people up to no good to know. \n\nHe drove casually for a few more minutes that seemed like an hour and I could tell we were getting close to the end of the road as the car navigated a dip in the road. As the car bounced slightly, I felt myself relax a bit since we were getting close to the end. \n\nBut any good feeling evaporated immediately as the road swerved left and the headlights illuminated a woman standing in the road and frantically waving her arms. She was in her late 20s and I could see a car nearby with its front end in a ditch. As we got closer, my stomach sank as I noticed the rear of the car had no license plate on it. But despite that, something about the car looked familiar. It was a red sedan with a noticeable dent on the right side near the trunk. \n\n\"What do I do?\" Jordan asked, his voice laced with nerves.\n\n\"Just like I told you earlier. Keep on going. Like she's not even there.\" But just in case the situation called for it, I got my foot ready to hit one of the pedals I have on my side of the car in case I ever need to take control of the vehicle. \n\n\"Ok. But what if she actually needs help?\"\n\n\"Then she'll be pleased when I call the authorities and let them know where she is.\"\n\n\"Smart move Mr. Allen.\"\n\n\"Like I said, it's all about context. There's nothing to prove that's even her car. Besides, I've seen that car before somewhere, and I've never seen her before. I'm just not sure where.\"\n\n\"That is weird.\" He said as he kept on driving. The woman in the road did nothing to stop or get out of the way as we approached. In fact, she stood there until she had no choice but to jump out of the way. As we drove by, I looked in the rearview mirror and saw her land in the ditch near the car. To my immense relief, nothing came out of the woods after us. \n\nI exhaled as quietly as I could and was silently thankful as the end of Jefferson Road appeared just ahead. I could also see the relief on Jordan's face as he also realized it was the end. \n\nJust as we passed a sign letting us know the road was ending and we were approaching an intersection, a figure came out of the woods and stood there with his back pressed to the trees. The figure stood where the woods began to thin out and waited there without moving. Beside me, I heard Jordan gasp.\n\n\"Keep going,\" I told Jordan without looking at him. The car's headlights revealed that the stranger was wearing black leather gloves, a black tracksuit, and his head was covered by a large black ski mask. As we passed, I locked eyes with the figure, and he raised his hand and wiggled his fingers at me in a creepy farewell gesture. To match him in the unflinching department, I made sure to flash him a wide grin and waved right back.\n\nAs the figure receded from view, I watched in the passenger seat mirror as the figure spoke into a walkie talkie and several other figures emerged from the woods on 4 Wheelers and roared down the road in the opposite direction from us. With that, we were at the end of Jefferson Road and arrived a few minutes later at a normal intersection in a nice suburb. \n\n\"Well done, Jordan,\" I said before I called the cops and explained what happened while Jordan drove us back to his parents\u2019 house. They were shocked when I told them what happened, but proud of their son. Before I left, I gave Jordan the 200 bucks I had in my wallet as a reward for a job well done. \n\nNot surprisingly, the cops searched the area and found nothing. No road closed sign, no woman, no car in the ditch, and certainly no masked figures. I thanked them for their time, ended the call, and hopped on the computer before turning in for the night. When I checked my email, I saw Ethan had finally sent me some photos from a few events we'd been to over the past couple years. I was about halfway through the pictures when one photo made me pick up the phone and call the police again. At a Fourth of July event two years ago, a bunch of us were watching fireworks while sitting in lawn chairs in Ethan's driveway. Parked right next to where we were sitting was the same red sedan with a dent, but this time it had a license plate. A license plate that belonged to Ethan's dad, who police eventually arrested in connection with a series of unsolved crimes and disappearances over the years, many of them happening in the woods near Jefferson Road.","107":"Hi everybody, this is my first time posting and i\u2019m sorry if it isn\u2019t the best. this is a true story that happened to my husband, a couple of friends, and i a few nights ago and i can\u2019t get it out of my mind, so i figured i\u2019d share it here. my husband will be D, his friend is W and his friends girlfriend is M for reference. \n\nIt was around 12:30 in the morning and we were all leaving this entertainment center and they had had a few so i was the only sober one. M was talking about going ghost hunting and i brought up elbow road, because D and M had gone a few weeks prior and had a freaky experience. i had never experienced paranormal before so i thought this would be exciting to see if this stuff is actually real. the boys tried convincing us that we shouldn\u2019t go because we wouldn\u2019t enjoy it and would be really scared but we pushed forward. i was stubborn. i shouldn\u2019t have been.\n\nIt took us about 30min to get there, so it was around 1am. we parked my car in this little sheriff pull off and climbed out. W told me and M that we had to sit on the hood, and ask for the spirits of a little boy and an old woman to show themselves. seemed easy. so me and M climbed on up and i didn\u2019t have the balls to talk, so M as loud as she could said \u201clittle boy, old woman. we ask you to show us that you\u2019re here with us\u201d and as soon as she finished the \u201cs\u201d in \u201cus\u201d there as movement to our right. i froze out of pure terror. was this just an animal? \n\nAfter a few minutes of staring at the spot we heard movement from, M continued. \u201ci know you\u2019re here, you\u2019re by the car.\u201d i wanted to leave so badly. D and W were on the sides of the car looking around and a rock was thrown and almost hit my husband in the knee, freaking everyone out. i started to look for a person because there\u2019s no way this is happening by itself. 2 more rocks were thrown at the back of my car where there\u2019s only woods as far as you could see. i closed my eyes and raised my hands to cover my ears, but as my hands were coming to my ears there was a puff of hot air against my neck and i froze. \n\nSuddenly there was moment surrounding us, and i mean surrounding us. there were twigs snapping in front of us, rustling grass to the left and the right, rocks shifting behind us. but what made us leave was one giant snap of a branch that was no more than 5ft away and all other sounds stopped. there were no crickets, no wind, nothing. M was the  first one off the hood and i quickly followed. both of us saying goodbye and D and M opened the doors for us. but whatever was there wasn\u2019t done with us yet. \n\nI started my car and quickly put it into drive,  double checking it was in the right gear because D\u2019s car malfunctioned when he was here, and took off. about 10 yards later my car stops accelerating and i look at my gear shift and it\u2019s in low, so i push it back into drive and something slams it back down into low gear. i know it wasn\u2019t my husband, nor our friends in the back seat. that was the last of what happened to us on elbow road.\n\nI was a believer in the paranormal before, but now i wish i wasn\u2019t. whatever is on elbow road wants company, but as soon as company arrives it doesn\u2019t want to lose its company."},"author":{"0":"Zithero","1":"Salt-Adeptness-3133","2":"ashrachell","3":"lightingnations","4":"donotshare","5":"Colourblindness","6":"BurntSchmidt","7":"cal_ness","8":"twocantherapper","9":"tavvyj","10":"Darkly_Gathers","11":"Darkheroxx","12":"MustyBones","13":"ArchonNoche","14":"Zaikovski","15":"thegeneralg","16":"RuTang94","17":"FirstBreath1","18":"thedreadfiles","19":"HeeHawShofar","20":"thepurplefeline","21":"Karysb","22":"Mammoth-Nothing2558","23":"tjlocke44","24":"LaDeckard","25":"Themascura","26":"Yobro1001","27":"spectracle99","28":"SkullSir3","29":"ksjeepfreak","30":"kazthemurphyfan","31":"SkittishReflections","32":"bruggalug","33":"Death__Valley","34":"Israel_Leon","35":"choneymaster545","36":"leoofalexandria","37":"Azraelux","38":"aproyal","39":"tjlocke44","40":"Sawyerthesadist","41":"EaPAtbp","42":"RobotVampire","43":"queenava9","44":"Atticus_Joyfull","45":"maddieharvey","46":"withbite","47":"Darkly_Gathers","48":"M00nfac3","49":"L-K-L_Mind","50":"lightingnations","51":"Justateahorse","52":"Themascura","53":"aaron__47","54":"ToffeeTorres","55":"mikeventure76","56":"Saint_Circa","57":"MysteryBlock","58":"Erutious","59":"Formal-Zone","60":"WeirdBryceGuy","61":"pwittykittykat","62":"MustyBones","63":"haroldkebba","64":"Blue_Aeries52","65":"templeoftheancients","66":"robotfromwalle","67":"Yobro1001","68":"anyaaiza_","69":"SuckingGodsFinger","70":"ColdIndrid","71":"michaelmcmichaels","72":"YukiharaMono","73":"M00nfac3","74":"Bestzugen","75":"twocantherapper","76":"RubyEggRollz","77":"Project_POE","78":"PostMortem33","79":"FishermanTales","80":"Cretin998","81":"Verastahl","82":"JhonaMonroe","83":"SovietOnion66","84":"AliceRosegreen","85":"Salsal_Azar","86":"Jigen8206","87":"Certain_Emergency122","88":"Jgrupe","89":"golden-abyss","90":"BonesDanger","91":"Themascura","92":"M0rtyM0use","93":"Darkly_Gathers","94":"LaDeckard","95":"MikeJesus","96":"Scorpwie","97":"maximumpowers69","98":"lady-of-hell","99":"thatreallyshortchick","100":"Loli-nero","101":"darthyeetusthewise","102":"Bestzugen","103":"Edwardthecrazyman","104":"aprivatedetective","105":"Sawyerthesadist","106":"thegeneralg","107":"awkdrey"},"upvote_ratio":{"0":0.97,"1":0.96,"2":0.97,"3":0.95,"4":0.9,"5":0.97,"6":1.0,"7":0.94,"8":0.96,"9":0.94,"10":0.94,"11":0.81,"12":0.94,"13":1.0,"14":1.0,"15":0.86,"16":0.96,"17":0.95,"18":0.96,"19":0.96,"20":0.91,"21":0.89,"22":1.0,"23":0.88,"24":0.85,"25":0.87,"26":0.95,"27":1.0,"28":0.77,"29":0.6,"30":0.7,"31":0.97,"32":0.88,"33":0.83,"34":0.83,"35":0.87,"36":0.81,"37":0.73,"38":0.91,"39":0.95,"40":0.89,"41":0.96,"42":0.85,"43":0.91,"44":0.75,"45":0.97,"46":0.96,"47":0.96,"48":0.96,"49":0.87,"50":0.94,"51":0.84,"52":0.92,"53":0.88,"54":0.55,"55":0.91,"56":0.8,"57":0.67,"58":0.9,"59":0.67,"60":0.97,"61":0.9,"62":0.97,"63":0.83,"64":0.88,"65":0.93,"66":0.82,"67":0.83,"68":0.88,"69":0.83,"70":0.75,"71":0.82,"72":0.67,"73":0.93,"74":0.73,"75":0.95,"76":0.96,"77":0.84,"78":0.94,"79":0.96,"80":0.75,"81":0.97,"82":1.0,"83":0.8,"84":0.92,"85":0.79,"86":0.91,"87":0.95,"88":0.92,"89":0.83,"90":0.91,"91":0.93,"92":0.82,"93":0.98,"94":0.72,"95":0.91,"96":0.96,"97":0.92,"98":0.89,"99":0.88,"100":0.87,"101":0.72,"102":0.88,"103":0.92,"104":0.83,"105":0.9,"106":0.88,"107":0.71}}
