B H.,2021-09-18,4,Cute restaurant pretty good and varied all vegan menu though drinks are a bit pricey Definitely recommend the peanut butter cup dessert would love to go back to try more items as Im sure they would be delicious as well Service was pretty good  except they did not make any attempt to check our vaccine card at the door Just interesting considering it is a public health order for all restaurants to do so,MILA Plant-Based
Jess S.,2021-07-05,5,Everything from the atmosphere to the service presentation of food prices and amazing flavours is TOP NOTCH This place is incredible We made reservations for Saturday for 5:30 and we were sat and served immediately Our server Calen was so friendly and very efficient His patience was incredible We had a toddler with us and he was able to navigate through the menu to help us sort out an appropriate meal My friend settled on Agedashi Tofu GF fried tofu sticky orange ginger sauce dry for the kid Dan Dan Noodles spicy dan dan sauce farro gai lan peanuts with sauce on the side and Mushroom + Sausage Tagliatelle GF OPT +3 pistachio pesto cream parmesan garlic bread wedge  no bread to make it GF Food was so well presented Service sizes are perfect The dan dan sauce was spicy and INCREDIBLE My pasta was really good and full of mushrooms as well I wish I got the Romesco Vodka Pasta but I am so looking forward to returning We also ordered Peanut Butter Cup Pie GF puffed crisps chocolate ganache maldon and it was hella good Perfection We also ordered their house wine Indigenous World Winery Red Blend  which complimented the meal perfectly Definitely coming back,MILA Plant-Based
Arlene B.,2021-10-03,4,You dont have to be vegan to appreciate the food experience at Mila restaurant I must admit that I was initially sceptical about how much I would enjoy this restaurant as I so often include meat as part of my diet But I was wrong and genuinely enjoyed my food My sister and I came to pick up food for lunch The restaurant has a polished feel from the chair line angles that echo in the tile work The staff at the front of house was attentive and helpful in terms of suggesting some of the most popular menu items and advising against certain items that might not be suitable for takeout eg ice cream We ordered the Mila roll the pistachio cream and sausage tagliatelle the bulgogi tacos and the peanut butter pie The Mila roll was served with the sauce on the side which I appreciated as Im not a huge fan of wasabi The roll itself was fresh and tasty I didnt try the bulgogi taco but my family members who have had it before have raved about them I thoroughly enjoyed the pistachio cream and sausage tagliatelle The sausage had characteristic fennel flavour and a meaty texture The pistachio cream and vegan grated cheese added the perfect amount of creaminess and cheesiness to the dish I in no way felt like I was missing out on meat or cheese in this dish The peanut butter pie alas melted somewhat during transport so we put it in the fridge to solidify Even if you are a meat eater Mila could possibly convince you to occasionally eat and enjoy a plant based meal I would definitely come back here,MILA Plant-Based
Poonam M.,2021-08-08,4,This the old Juniper so the layout is the same We had Bao smash burger Dan Dan noodles mushroom and sausage tagliatelle and peach cobbler All phenomenal Hands down the best vegan food I have had So so good The service Not so good My noodles did not come until I had asked for it twice The glass of wine my friend ordered never came About three different times we were offered food that we did not ask for...so the front staff a hot mess The chef clearly knows what they are doing I would recommend this place only bc the food is outstanding Just manage your expectations regarding getting your food on time,MILA Plant-Based
Suzan L.,2021-06-26,1,Very disappointing experience The Sakura cocktail tasted awful floral in all the wrong ways  it was so bad that I didnt even want to drink it after 2 sips When I bought this up with the server he just shrugged and told me that I can get a different drink next time Wow is this really what to expect from a higher scale restaurant like this It took forever for the food we ordered to come out How does it take over 30 min to make 6 pieces of sushi for one The coconut curry noodles were awful It was so salty it was almost inedible My friends dandan noodles were so much better However the dishes were lukewarm by the time we received them Makes me wonder if they were just sitting there Overall a complete disappointment I paid over 50 for bad food bad drinks and bad service,MILA Plant-Based
Celina L.,2021-08-12,5,I know the thought of vegan food can scare off people but as someone who is not vegan this place was TOP TIER The ambience inside gave me high-end Gastown restaurant vibes especially with how stunning the bar was and how the space was designed The food Im telling you you cant even tell anything was vegan The aburi oshi tasted close to the real thing because of the vegan mayo PLEASE get the smashed potatoes Its so addicting The Mila roll had heart of palm in it Who knew a forgotten ingredient like that could make something taste sooo good Please go check it out with your vegan friends or with your non vegan friends Im definitely going to go back and take my bf there ,MILA Plant-Based
Sangeetha M.,2021-05-05,4,I ordered for delivery so I cant comment on the actual restaurant I was excited to try this restaurant because a lot of people mentioned how amazing it is But I was quite reluctant because it is more on the pricey side and I always find it a little odd to pay for vegetarian food more than or as much as I would pay for meat or seafood After trying the food I stand by this Good food but too expensive for what it is IMO I tried the mushroom and sausage tagliatelle It was a big filling portion and it felt like I had meat Really hit the spot Desert  I tried the peanut butter cup pie I shared this with a friend and one slice was way too much for the both of us Its really good as if youre having Reeses peanut butter cups but it also got to be way too rich and too much I must say that it looks beautiful though with the gold and some crunchy bits,MILA Plant-Based
Pam C.,2021-02-16,4,MILA is right beside Bao Bei formerly Juniper MILA was very busy the night we visited We had reservations but we werent seated at a nice spot Our server was nice and I didnt mind waiting a little longer as they were pretty busy I ordered Aburi sushi and the tagliatelle They used carrots as fish which I thought was fantastic It tasted really good with the melting cheese atop It made me chuckle in my head when I tasted the carrot as I thought in my head Omg that is so vegan Haha The Pesto Tagliatelle was amazing Even the bread I am not really into crunchy bread but this was had flavour in it so I ate the whole entire thing I love pasta in general and this was one great We loved the Broccolini so much that we ordered two It was the best thing we had on our first visit We will come back again to try other dishes,MILA Plant-Based
Matt B.,2021-02-14,5,Vegan brunch doesnt get much better than this Weve been wanting to try this place since it opened We ordered some brunch for take-out around noon and it was ready within 25 minutes I ordered the tempeh rib hash 16 and my wife got the breakfast sandwich 18  both were pretty magnificent Tempeh rib hash this comes with perfectly roasted potatoes tempeh wild mushrooms tofu scramble avocado roast veg and arugula with a wonderful sauce The flavours and textures were just incredible Very filling 5/5 Breakfast sandwich pretty decadent sandwich with sausage tofu scramble cheese avocado etc served with smashed potatoes Almost too decadent and extremely feeling Very tasty 4.5/5 Overall though its on the pricier side the quality clearly matches and the portions are generous Looking forward to returning to try other items on both their brunch and other menus Highly recommended,MILA Plant-Based
Coco L.,2021-10-24,5,Such a good brunch spot Everyones meals were fire and the mimosa flight was awesome 10/10 recommend,MILA Plant-Based
Doris H.,2021-01-31,5,Ive ordered from Mila a few times before on UberEats and I was beyond impressed each time I got to go in person today and still does not disappoint First things first I am not a vegan but I love trying plant based foods The first time I ordered the Aburi Lox Oshi Sushi I was blown away as I truly could not tell the difference and the texture felt so close to the actual thing Today I ordered the Bento Lunch which came with the Kuri Curry Soup Yam Tempura and a choice of a half sushi roll of the Aburi Lox Oshi or the Mila Roll and of course I went for the Aburi Lox since its got such amazing flavour It only came to 12 It was definitely enough to feed me but I definitely could have eaten more if I wanted to I also got the Isla Nublar cocktail which is dangerous since Im obsessed with it now and the Sakura cocktail which has an edible flower in it Super cute My friend ordered the fish n chips and she has been a vegetarian for a loooong time and said that it was awesome We are definitely coming back here again,MILA Plant-Based
Manfred D.,2021-10-24,1,Horrible service We waited almost 2 hours for a table The host initially said that the wait time was 1 hours than she came and shame that we would have to wait for more 1 hour What kind of joke is that She should have said in the first time that we would said suck long time Also I found her very rude and snobby I will never set my foot is this place again There are restaurants with better service,MILA Plant-Based
Leeza N.,2021-07-20,4,Finally got the chance to try Mila for a late lunch yesterday since they were open for indoor dining The tables inside are very spacious and clean there is also a huge bar as well The servers were very nice and informative about the menu I decided to get the smashed chips and the mila roll and my friend got a kale caesar salad since shes allergic to eggs this was her first time trying a caesar salad The smashed chips came out first and they were SO GOOD It was kind of like home style fries that you get at brunch but more crunchier and flavourful due to the miso garlic butter and it came with a sambal ginger aioli sauce which tasted so amazing tasted kind of like chipotle sauce without the smokiness Next my mila roll and my friends kale caesar salad came out The mila roll was plated so nicely with drizzles of wasabi mango mayo and crunchy toppings The roll itself consisted of avocado cucumber and heart of palm mix which resembled the texture of unagi It was so delicious I honestly didnt even feel like it was plant based My friends kale caesar salad was so good as well the dressing was amazing and the kale leaves were not too salty at all My friend also got a cocktail yesterday and she said it was so good but I forgot the name To finish off our meal we ordered the churros to share The churros were garnished with pistachios and a rose cardamom syrup As much as they were delicious the churros were TINY and for 8 I expected to get long churros but it was very small and a bit dissapointing which is why I had to take off a star because everything else portion wise was amazing I definitely will return to Mila with my vegan friends soon to try other items on their menu,MILA Plant-Based
Bekah H.,2021-10-10,1,So disappointed All the food looked so good but everything had such a weird taste The Romesco pasta was ok but the veggies accompanying it had a strong stringent taste that made me gag The bao buns also looked appetizing but the tempeh was flavored in an odd way I really cant describe what it is making these dishes off but I was surprised it was as bad as it was Even the peanut butter cup pie wasnt anything to rave about Looked nice but was just meh,MILA Plant-Based
Elvi R.,2020-10-27,5,I had been waiting a while to go check out MILA Was so happy that I decided to go here for my birthday dinner It did not disappoint Before I even got to the restaurant I looked at the menu and already had a hard time ordering since everything sounded so good We finally decided to get the Bao Buns the Tagliatelle the Bulgogi tacos and the carrot lox oshi Everything was AH-MAZING 10/10 for all the dishes I ordered The one little thing that bugged me a little was the price for the Oshi I did find it a little on the pricey side especially cause theres no fish in it So I dont think that I would order that again Other than that I cant wait to go back to try more items on their menu,MILA Plant-Based
Tasfia T.,2021-08-15,5,We came here just for dessert since they are open late and I am glad we did All the desserts were excellent I would highly recommend the peanut butter cup pie Cant wait to come back here for dinner,MILA Plant-Based
Jill N.,2020-11-11,5,Some of the best vegan food Ive ever had We had an amazing bottle of little Engine Chardonnay recommended by the sommelier who was very knowledgeable and patient with us The Aburi sushi was to die for as well as the mushroom toast The boa buns were very tasty too Burger was top notch and the Harvest Salad and Tagliatelle was also phenomenal Highly recommend,MILA Plant-Based
Kristie W.,2020-09-28,4,I was too excited when I caught word of a new vegan place that served not only usual burgers wraps and buddha bowls On my first visit I tried the Salmon Lox Oshi bao buns and sausage pesto tagliatelle The salmon oshi looks exactly like a Miku style salmon oshi and it pretty well tastes identical except for the fact that a slice of carrot replaces the usual torched salmon The bao buns contain a thick serving of tempeh that is surprisingly tender and picks up the flavors of the two sauces used in the bun The pesto tagliatelle was yummy and you just about forget that the sausage is plant-based Overall the dishes have no flaws but they are not particularly novel or mind blowing Their cocktails menu looks awesome as well Still the meal ends up being rather pricey for casual dining roughly 60 after tax and tip for 2 appies and a main without any drinks Cocktails are about 15 a piece You also need to make a reservation well in advance even for a party of two and especially on a weekend,MILA Plant-Based
Cherry W.,2021-03-08,4,They have a max 2 hour sitting and everything is partitioned Quite cute aesthetic The food that I had tried was really yummy but definitely on the pricer side The portions are smaller which is why I gave them 4 stars I saw a lot of people getting drinks and tasting trays so maybe that is why their portions are smaller If you are looking for a place/brunch to fill you up I dont know if this is the place for you Their Aburi Lox is really something else and I totally recommend getting it The way they treat the carrot is fantastic to be like salmon If you like Aburi sushi but dont like the fishy taste of salmon this is for you The Crab Benedict is good However with the soft tofu as the egg and the hollandaise sauce it really overpowers/overshadows the crab which I really couldnt taste With the price point I dont know if it is really worth it I wish they gave more smashed potatoes,MILA Plant-Based
Chloe C.,2021-02-08,5,Was disappointed by my first brunch visit but my second visit was much better Glad I gave their brunch a second chance Tempeh Rib Hash 5/5 Amazing crispy potatoes with tempeh mushrooms and tofu scramble topped with a delicious and creamy gochujang mayo  whats not to love Crab Cake Benedict 5/5 The crab cake was the star of the show It was so delicious Ive never had hearts of palm before but now Im sold The tofu egg was okay but the hollandaise could be creamier and the flavour needs some adjustment The side crispy potatoes are literal crack  Breakfast Baos 4/5 The bao was fluffy and the sambal aioli was creamy and flavourful The textures were a bit one dimensional and the tofu scramble with the bao was quite tasteless once you run out of aioli The bacun was a nice touch but the strip was way too tiny The buns needed more aioli and double the bacun Quiche 2.5/5 This was a soggy unattractive mess Looked nothing like the pictures No pie crust at all which is the best part The dill yoghurt was not good and almost ruined the whole dish It was just a pile of tofu scramble with some unseasoned carrots Not impressed PBJ Waffles 1/5 Another dish which fell way short of my expectations Definitely not worth the hype The only good thing was that the waffles were crispy and the peanut butter was tasty The waffles had a weird rosemary/thyme flavour that did not work with the other components of the dish The amount of peanut butter was abysmal just a drizzle and the whole dish was just a bunch of confusing flavours Definitely get the hash and the crab cake benny and maybe the breakfast baos Would skip the other items,MILA Plant-Based
Charly S.,2021-05-12,5,I stopped here specifically for the Vegan Benny a month or so ago and Im happy to report it met my craving and was very tasty and hit the spot I also tried the chaga tea latte and I really enjoyed it The food was well prepared and well presented The owners are lovely kind and welcoming I also bought the plant based omelette mix to take home and I really enjoyed the flavour/texture if you pick it up remember to follow the directions carefully I didnt and I could see in hindsight the errors of my ways  haha  but it was still very tasty,Lotus Seed Vegan
Becky T.,2021-08-02,5,The pho is yummy Broth is very flavorful and lots of veggies and some tofu Will be back to try the other items,Lotus Seed Vegan
Gurpreet S.,2021-10-24,1,I am very surprised that this place has close to five stars My husband and I came in 40 minutes prior to closing hoping to find some vegetarian friendly food As we walked in and before we could say anything we were told that they were about to close that if we wanted anything it needs to be take out We went ahead and ordered some food The kitchen is visible from the front of the restaurant and the preparation was not sanitary The cashier helped make food and did not wash her hands she touched every item of food with her bare hands The food was also bland we ordered the Benedict just mushrooms and avocado on half burnt bread and pho tasteless For the money that they charge their food is very subpar,Lotus Seed Vegan
Donna D.,2020-12-03,4,In need of a sit down meal after running around Broadway Lotus Seed is a vegans choice spot I came here for lunch again after a day of errands and shopping We were greeted and got safely seated in a distanced table My partner and I ordered the baked spring rolls a meatless ball sandwich vietnamese coffee and a macaroon Everything was delish We split both meals to try each and were very satisfied with our choice The meatless ball sandwich was filling a light it was perfectly dosed in sauce so nothing was dry about it If Im in the area and have time for sit down vegan Id def visit again,Lotus Seed Vegan
Lily D.,2021-07-29,5,I love this restaurant My favourite dish so far is the poke bowl I also really love the blue flame smoothie Everything Ive tried so far is so delicious Definitely one of my favourite restaurants,Lotus Seed Vegan
Chloe C.,2021-06-10,4,Their poke bowl is very flavourful with many components but could use more chipotle mayo and toppings as I was left with a lot of brown rice and quinoa at the end The thai curry wasnt my favourite as it was quite sweet due to the pineapple and had a pretty strong pineapple flavour The rice noodles also clumped together a little bit Id go with the poke bowl but not the curry A good place to grab a quick healthy meal,Lotus Seed Vegan
Fernanda G.,2020-10-21,5,This restaurant serves some of the most delicious food I tried in Vancouver I know most of their ingredients are organic and everything is made from scratch,Lotus Seed Vegan
Spring C.,2020-08-06,4,So happy to have found BAKED spring rolls I just wish they came with peanut sauce or a little more sauce  I always run out of sauce before the roll runs out I am happy that this place  at least with the dishes Ive tried  doesnt use fake meats My patties in the soup were made from seeds nuts beans  much healthier Thank you very grateful for a real vegan restaurant with real food,Lotus Seed Vegan
Ayaka H.,2018-11-29,5,Ive been searching for Vegan Asian cuisine in an all vegan establishment and Im happy to announce that Ive found one that I can rave about to everyone I naturally prefer food that isnt deep fried whenever possible so their baked spring rolls stood out at me Although it lacked the crisp of a traditional spring roll it was still bursting with flavour and the fresh variety of veg fillings made it healthy Their winner however was their Thai curry see pic  Oh my goodness if I could have their recipe Id make it all the time seriously I dont think Ive had better Thai curry anywhere else in the city Will I return Yes of course Im anticipating my next visit already Tip casual atmosphere good for quick lunches,Lotus Seed Vegan
Nicole B.,2019-09-17,1,I ordered the yellow curry dish and was thoroughly disappointed It had too much carrots and corn in it and the veg didnt taste fresh The plate was also dirty The spring rolls are baked very dry The cilantro looked old that was on the other dish When I spoke to the owner she was surprised but in the end I was reimbursed for the dish I did not enjoy the food here they menu is weird and has some pasta dishes and Vietnamese dishes it was all over the place and didnt really have a vibe that matched the name Food is sub-par lacking flavour and lukewarm,Lotus Seed Vegan
Carolyn L.,2018-06-13,4,The Thai curry was really delicious I ordered it to go and had them separate the rice noodle from the curry The portion of rice noodle looked small but it was actually a lot Looks were deceiving For non-vegans/vegetarians I jazzed up the curry by adding roast chicken meat to it when I got back That was amazing The curry was great on rice too I think I may start doing that Order the dishes to go so that I can add meat/seafood to complement the meal,Lotus Seed Vegan
Pam C.,2018-03-20,5,It has been MONTHS since I wanted to try this place and finally last night a friend who is a regular brought me here to eat some delicious vegetarian dishes The owners are Buddhists and theyre super nice Its a clean and humble restaurant near a park and a ten-minute walk from Joyce-Collingwood skytrain station I ordered their famous Thai curry with rice noodle and my friend ordered the spaghetti with Alfredo sauce Both dishes came in massive bowls with a lot of food So be careful and dont waste anything The Thai curry is flavourful and mildly spicy It is worth trying if you are in the area or want to eat some delicious vegetarian dish I had a small taste of the spaghetti with Alfredo sauce and it was really good too However it is something anyone can make at home so Id stick with my Thai curry when I come back again next time There are some parking right outside the restaurant but if its full you can go to the underground parking that is less than a minute walk away,Lotus Seed Vegan
Lauren L.,2018-12-30,5,Theres something to be said for a really good steak but honestly folks The more you all rave how you cant eat pansy vegetarian food or it just doesnt fill you up or its rabbit or girl food Sure give me those excuses but when you get clogged arteries from heavy meat and fat and a sedentary lifestyle dont come to me Im not your doctor Poor soul the doctor not you The steak lovers out there sure lets just eat steak and lobster all day but honestly what your body really needs is this place The food they make here is made with love and care and your colon and the rest of your body especially the heart will love you for it 5 stars for everything here I just wish we could have them closer to where I live ,Lotus Seed Vegan
Matt B.,2019-05-17,3,Updating my review for the new location The place is comfortable and casual Large menu now that runs the gamut from Asian mostly Vietnamese cuisine to brunch items and many other items I tried the vegan pho which was only decent  lacked flavour but was a decent portion The prices are quite high now 13.95++ for the pho which is quite a bit higher than most other places in town for a vegan pho I also dont like their embrace of pseudoscientific nonsense they use Kangen alkaline water which claims to be healthier its not and non-GMO tofu embracing the anti-GMO pseudoscientific nonsense that many unthinking folk have bought into Overall decent but didnt captivate me to come back any time soon,Lotus Seed Vegan
Thomas C.,2020-02-28,5,New location even better food Highly recommend the sunny paté sub Especially if you like tuna sandwiches They have also been adding more daiya cheese lately which is just the cherry on top The food in combination with complimentary kangen water just makes this place 11/10,Lotus Seed Vegan
Teresa V.,2018-12-27,1,Came here because Ive always wanted to try their vegan Vietnamese coffee I was very disappointed in the taste of this drink Being Vietnamese and having drank a lot of their coffee this one was way too sweet Vietnamese coffee is know for its strong coffee flavour Secondly the almond condensed milk added a nutty flavour which I didnt like As well there was way too much ice which diluted the whole coffee flavour,Lotus Seed Vegan
Sara A.,2017-07-21,4,We had the following Lotus Seeds Pho  it is a slow boiled soup for over 6 hrs they use KANGEN water here with fresh broccoli zucchini carrots daikon and lotus root along with herbs  aromatic spices and non GMO tofu The soup was very tasty I will re-order next time Baked Spring Roll with mung bean vermicelli auricularia carrot  taro root It was very tasty but a bit too gingery for me Smoothies were delicious Great customer service too,Lotus Seed Vegan
Phi G.,2019-09-10,2,I stumbled upon this place during a walkabout Decided to give it a go without looking up reviews I will say that Im the 1% that does not like this place Thai Curry was too sweet for me I have become hypersensitive to sugars in food It ruined the dish and I couldnt continue Salad roll good but broke apart due to wet mushrooms Flavors were there if it could only stay together The food here seems like mediocre home cooking I supposed for vegans its food heaven but its slightly better than grocery deli section Overall disappointing that I had to go find something to fill me up afterwards Even now looking at the pictures makes me say yeah no not coming back ever,Lotus Seed Vegan
Jess S.,2018-09-23,3,Ive heard so many good things about this place and was super excited to check it out The place is small but offers so many awesome options for vegans and vegetarians plus GF If you have sensitivitys to garlic and ginger check this place too The staff are nice and very efficient I ordered the tofu satay which comes with salad a spring roll brown rice and two skewers of tofu veggies and pineapple The flavour is nice and the portion is big It wasnt what I was expecting and wished there was more sauce I also ordered the brown rice Alfredo It comes with mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes Definitely a unique take on Alfredo but again not what I was expecting Prices are good and portions are excellent I will definitely try this place again,Lotus Seed Vegan
Kate T.,2018-07-20,5,Came here for the 1st time and had the grilled satay platter on rice noodles  so delicious healthy and a huge portion Im so stuffed The satay sauce on the veg  tofu skewers was delicious,Lotus Seed Vegan
José Luis R.,2021-06-07,5,Crispy BBQ Burger Amazing you need to try Sweet Chili Cauliflower you need to try The Jalapeño Vodka Caesar very tasty as well you should try it,MeeT in Gastown
Sofie P.,2021-05-21,4,I got the first dose of the vaccine last week and decided to treat myself I was in the area anyway and only had to wait 20 or so minutes for a table for 1 take yourself out on a date Highly recommend I tried the Cauliflower starter for the first time and man oh man is it yummy To make it a meal I also got the TeeM Poutine which was as delicious as always Service was amazing  everyone was sitting outside for safety reasons obviously and it was getting late and a bit chilly and a few staff members brought out the heating lamps on request which was great My only complaint not really complaint but just like dang was the price of the cauliflower bites You get 5 wings so its not really evenly shareable if you WERE to split and its 11.5 I personally find this incredibly pricey for what you get Still massive bill aside this is definitely one of my fave restaurants and you will be sure to find something you like,MeeT in Gastown
Jill N.,2021-02-27,5,Agatha our server was awesome and went above and beyond Literally made our night Wow the chefs are also ON POINT  one of the best vegan cheesecakes I think Ive ever had Paired with coconut vanilla vegan ice cream Delicious For dinner I got the Seoul Bowl  my friend got the Caesar Salad with Kalamari mushroom calamari Both were fab ,MeeT in Gastown
Matt B.,2021-03-06,4,Only this location currently at least now offers brunch everyday from 11am-4pm so we had to try it out Pretty gigantic brunch menu with all sorts of creative items I ordered the Steak  Mushroom Benny 16.75 plus tax and my wife ordered the B.E.S.T Bacun English muffin Sausage  Tofu egg Breakfast Sandwich through DoorDash and our order was delivered in about half an hour  awesome Massive portions as Meet has become known for The Benny was an explosion of flavour from the steak soycurls sauteed mushrooms crispy onions and tofu egg with a really thick decadent hollandaise sauce You get two massive bennies so this alone would be enough to fill you up The dish also comes with salad and an emorious portion of home fries The salad is fine with a very pungent dressing you need less than half of what they give you and the home fries were battered and mega-deep fried  honestly I didnt like these fries  way too oily/greasy and heavy But the bennies themselves were delicious Same deal with the B.E.S.T  a pretty decadent sandwich with the bacun sausage and egg  which also comes with the same side salad and fries Overall this is really heavy greasy salty food Its a treat once in a while and the execution is very good on the main parts of the dishes Id rather some nice roasted breakfast potatoes or at least something less heavy/greasy Reasonably priced for the portion Glad that Meet exists and is doing such interesting stuff Recommended,MeeT in Gastown
Chloe C.,2021-01-23,5,Their new brunch is freaking amazing Great portions decent prices Lots of variety to choose from I wish I had enough stomach space to try everything Steak and Mushroom Benny 5/5 The soy curl steak and mushrooms were flavourful The hollandaise was creamy and delicious the tofu egg had a great texture and the mayo was so creamy and tasty The english muffin was good too The side salad was decent but could use more dressing The potatoes were nice and crispy but a bit too salty The buffalo sauce was creamy but a little too spicy for me BLT 5/5 The bread was fluffy the tofu scramble was great the bacon I think it might be Happy Veggie World had a good texture and flavour and the mayo tied everything together nicely Also comes with a side salad crispy potatoes and buffalo sauce Chikn and Waffles 5/5 Could use more chikn deep fried mushrooms but still delicious Waffles are super moist and tasty  you cant tell that theyre gluten free Im normally super skeptical of gf things but I was pleasantly surprised BBQ Baked Beans 5/5 Very delicious The bbq flavour was great and made these more unique than regular tomato baked beans Fried Egg 5/5 I believe this is the Happy Veggie World fried egg Was not disappointed as it was quite realistic and very delicious Would go to Vegan Supply to pick up some of these to make myself at home for sure Maple Mustard Mayo 4/5 I hated it at first but the more I ate it the more I liked it Definitely has a sharp tangy wasabi-like mustard kick to it Could be heavier on the maple flavour as it didnt really come through,MeeT in Gastown
Elvi R.,2020-08-04,5,Went twice in one weekend for their weekly feature Ive been to the Main St  the Yaletown location many times but I rarely come to the Gastown one The staff is super friendly I love how they expanded their patio outside Much more space now to enjoy your meal Al Fresco I had the Caesar salad with kalamarifor the first time ans it was really delicious it was topped with a vegan tzatziki Yum Their Mac  Cheeze is packed with so much flavour My little one really enjoyed it its pretty much the only thing that we order for him when we go to Meet I wish they had a kids menu or more kid friendly options,MeeT in Gastown
Manbir R.,2020-06-08,4,I was happy to have meet doors open after covid 19 shut down Good to be back here Its vegetarian peoples heaven All sort of colour ful dishes tingles your taste buds and fullfill your appetite Versatile drinks are my favourite thing here I had beet it which was a soda drink with beets n cranberry juice Kind a liked it Though u can sincerely drink just alcoholic drinks here,MeeT in Gastown
Bryan F.,2021-08-28,4,MeeT is definitely worth a visit They take traditional menu items and give them a complete vegan twist I definitely recommend their chicken and waffles The oyster mushrooms are delicious and the syrup compliments perfectly,MeeT in Gastown
Mandarin Y.,2020-03-03,4,Ill admit I was a bit skeptical when coming here but I gotta say they exceeded my expectations I was expecting the food to be bland but everything we ordered was pretty tasty To start off our meal we ordered the artichoke spinach dip and sweet chili cauliflower The dip had a smooth creamy texture although I thought it could have used just a touch more salt The cauliflower was fried perfectly but I wasnt too fond of the sweet chili sauce As for my main I ordered the Lovely bowl and substituted the brown rice for quinoa The dish was surprisingly filling and very flavorful The dining area had a cool casual hipster vibe Service was very good and friendly I would recommend checking this place out if you are in the mood for something on the lighter side,MeeT in Gastown
Giselle M.,2020-01-14,5,It starts with a mission MeeTs mission is to help transition the mainstream to eating more plant-based foods in a friendly accepting and engaging venue from their website Not only that but they also aim to show people that comfort food that connects and nourishes us can be vegetarian/vegan delicious made from scratch and can actually be quite affordable Hands in the air for all those positive vibes My hubby and I both vegetarian/plant-based often vegan and work in the health  fitness industry first discovered MeeT late summer 2019 We were in town for a half marathon and after a long travel day we wanted/needed something nutritious fresh and delicious and to dine in a place with a fun and inviting atmosphere We pretty much hit the jackpot here at MeeT in Gastown Heres what we ordered and would recommend over and over again 1 The Big Yum 2 Organic Quinoa  Roasted Yam Salad 3 Hoochy Booch Turmeric Ginger Black Pepper Kombucha 4 House-made Ginger Shrub Beer Even if youre not necessarily vegetarian or vegan you should give this place a try I doubt youll be disappointed In fact you may just be converted  We loved the food bevy service and ambiance so much we came back again on our last night in town with a couple friends And we still talk about The Big Yum Bowl to this day,MeeT in Gastown
Iris L.,2020-07-08,5,Of all the vegan desserts Ive tried from a variety of places the one Ill most come back to is the chocolate coconut ganache tart from here I ordered via Uber Eats as a late night treat and this did not disappoint It was packaged beautifully and when I opened the box the chocolate and mint combined created such a pleasant aroma The tart itself is absolutely delicious Everything about it tied perfectly together The chocolate ganache was just the right amount of sweet and when paired with the shredded coconut and vanilla creme drizzle it was like heaven for your mouth Even the crust offered a standout flavour of coconut with a soft texture that fit with the rest of the dessert well Each individual aspect had a delicious flavour and shined all on its own while combining together as a whole flawlessly If youre ever in the area I highly recommend checking out this treat If youre not make some time to Its worth it,MeeT in Gastown
Cyrah E.,2019-11-11,4,Much much better experience coming here the second time The service was good and the food even more delicious Todays order Notcho average nacho fries Butter chikkin poutine Crispy bbq burger Im glad I came back My bf and I had a great time,MeeT in Gastown
Paula F.,2019-08-16,5,Well worth the wait This plant-based restaurant is located in the heart of the Gastown in Vancouver There is a lot to do if you have to wait The indoor and outdoor seating was equivalent in size The decor is modern rustic and dimly lit in the evening The vibe during our visit was loud social and fun My daughter and I arrived at MeeT at around 6:30 pm on a Wednesday evening The restaurant was packed and we were told our wait was 20 minutes I was ready to pass but my daughter really wanted to dine here so we went for a little walk Within 10 minutes we received a text telling us our table was ready We were seated inside Two extensive menus were presented to us a drink menu and a food menu The food menu boasted several vegetarian creative comfort food items all made from scratch See my photos of the menu After much contemplation we opted for the Seoul Bowl and the Big Yum Bowl with a side of Butter Chicken The wait was reasonable for how busy it was Our bowls were colorful and plated well The taste was amazing The Seoul Bowl has more character than the Big Yum as it had many more spices and a zing to it Both were very filling The Butter Chicken was delicious and spiced like Indian Chicken Marsala It was a bit heavier than the bowls Service was outstanding Our server Ted S was professional friendly patient attentive and helpful The two single user gender neutral restrooms were basic industrial clean and functional So far this is my favorite restaurant in Vancouver 5 solid stars,MeeT in Gastown
Alannah M.,2020-12-29,3,My 4 broccoli  Hey prep team your scale broke Anyway the rest is F@$!ing off the hook but portion control is lacking Yum,MeeT in Gastown
Laura L.,2020-02-01,4,Went here last night Thought I would give the gastown location a try after having found the yaletown location somewhat disappointing The service was great and ambiance a lot more welcoming We tried the noodle bowl and beefless ginger bowl both were pretty tasty I wish there would have been more tofu in the noodles and more veggies overall in both bowls We also had the cauliflower appetizers that we had actually loved in Yaletown but this time found the texture more mushy and the sauce more watered down Overall the Meet restaurants are a decent vegeterian option but I have yet to be wowed Would recommend you give them a try nonetheless,MeeT in Gastown
Issabelle F.,2019-02-21,4,Im trying to slowly transition to a plant based diet and MeeT is one of my favourite places to get plant based food in the city Simply because it doesnt taste like your eating plant based dishes A couple things that Ive gotten from MeeT that Ive loved + Angry Burger I get this w the beyond meat veggie patty + Sweet Chili Cauliflower fave appy + Chiggin Things second fave appy + All their poutine their regular poutine takes the crown for me though + Hot Chiggn Caesar Salad so freaking delicious + Mac N Cheese Bowl Everything Ive tried Ive loved Even when I was eating meat I still loved coming here because everyhting is so delicious and filling For the prices youre paying the portions are very generous and the quality of the food is always consistent Since its in the heart of Gastown parking is really really annoying Luckily when I come to eat at MeeT Im usually taking transit If you are driving down theres a couple parking garages close by or theres street parking a few blocks away Service has always been prompt and friendly Plus they give really great recommendations This place is usually busy on the weekends and in evenings I love coming in post lunch rush though or right before the dinner rush If Im craving good comfort food MeeT is one of my first stops,MeeT in Gastown
Benjamin S.,2019-12-03,5,If youre vegan heres the restaurant of your dreams MeeT was my destination when MEETING up with an old friend from childhood who is vegan and Im more of a plant based person as well so this did me just fine Arriving in Gastown Ill certainly say that parking is no small task but once I found a place to park figured out how to use their easy parking system and headed over to the restaurant all the frustrating parts of the experience were over MeeT isnt right on the street front but in a cozy courtyard off the main drag Its perfect It made the experience all that much better as all the windows were open and werent listening to traffic whizzing by but just the sounds of our fellow dining companions The restaurant is large and when I visited on a summer day it was packed A very good sign of a good restaurant The menu is expansive and even hardcore meat eaters would be enthusiastic about the menu The days of thinking that vegans eat salads and boiled vegetables are over when you can get mac n cheese chicken wings to hamburgers and all the other comfort foods sans meat My friends boyfriend recommended a bowl that he gets there so I followed suit as everything in the bowl sounded delicious and right up my alley It was all very good and have thought about it since several times The next time Im in Vancouver Ill be heading to MeeT,MeeT in Gastown
Proshat F.,2021-07-24,3,I was disappointed this time I always order the Macro bowl and usually ask for descent amount of tofu Today I also asked the server to ensure there is enough amount of tofu but it was even less than the times I do not ask for that In the bowl it was not even one cube size of tofu There were only 3 thin slices in big bowl which is disappointing  Basically we are not there to eat a bowl full of rice with a very very small portion of mushroom tofu and piece of broccoli and a piece of kale When I told the server that it tastes good  but only 3 slices of tofu is too little they remind me that the portions are like that Meet was my favourite place but I am really unhappy with their food and service today,MeeT in Gastown
Nidhi M.,2019-05-04,2,Came on a Friday afternoon and was seated at the bar right away We ordered the Ktown poutine  not good too strong of a kimchi flavor Not-cho average nacho fries  ok incredibly cheesy not my cup of tea The service was great but the food was not Parking street metered parking,MeeT in Gastown
Margaret M.,2021-09-17,1,We were at the Gastown location we assume it must be good because we always see a line up at their Yaletown location So we decided to try it out we did not know it was vegan restaurant We ordered the double patty burger my spouse asked how it was  Still not knowing that it was a vegan restaurant  The server started to say that it was made with lentils and it was very good I stopped her and told her we are meat eaters she said we should try the beyond meat burger it was 3.00 more then the double patty burger so we said okay well try it We also ordered coffee when it was served the spoon she gave me was dirty it had someones food still on it I flagged her down to let her know well another server came back with a soup spoon and said it was the only spoon that she found was clean Okay its not going good are we going to regret this We waited over 45 min for our order Ive tried to flag our server but she kept ignoring me It does not take that long to make a beyond beef burger I knew it was going to be bad I said to my spouse that this is b.s Lets leave  So we left No where on their menu was any sign that MeeT was a vegan restaurant We were willing to try it out but the dirty spoon poor service and druggies digging in the potted plants just grossed me out I could only imagine how dirty the kitchen is,MeeT in Gastown
Leon S.,2021-10-04,5,Amazing vegan pizza Employees treat you like family and the overall vibe of the place is real nice if youre looking for a cheat meal without cheating this is definitely the place for it,Vegan Cave Cafe
Chloe C.,2021-07-15,5,Really amazing pizza The cashier guy was really friendly as well Was skeptical of their gf crusts but the almond flour crust I got really exceeded my expectations I got half pesto and half bombay chikn and both were so flavourful Bombay chikn was way too spicy for me though unfortunately but it was still really tasty I loved both but the pesto with broccoli was my favourite I also got a twix bar which was good but not mind blowing,Vegan Cave Cafe
Sofie P.,2021-05-31,4,My go-to here Pretty delish Ive had this a number of times and always remember loving it This time it came with daiya cheddar on top of the house-made ricotta I cant remember if it always came this way The menu as well as other photos Ive seen of the pizza have mozzarella not cheddar Again still a good pizza but not as good as I remember pre-COVID,Vegan Cave Cafe
Sumit D.,2020-12-21,4,The short  dined in once in 2019 would go back again  tried 2 pizzas liked both  tried a dessert bar-shaped did not like it as it was too sweet and hard for me The long  vegan  no dedicated parking  one might feel a little uncomfortable about the location  some seating available inside  ambience was average,Vegan Cave Cafe
Elena A.,2020-04-19,5,What a great place to have vegan pizza I am amazed with all the flavors and the crust is just the yummiest Ive got their Freaky Greeky pizza Its a pesto based pizza topped with cashew feta garlic tomato olives and red onion The pizza is loaded with ingredients I enjoyed it so much I cant wait to order it again I highly recommend this place would choose their pizza any day without thinking twice Friendly staff and great service,Vegan Cave Cafe
Garry C.,2021-04-11,5,I just had the La Tinga burrito and it was fantastic It was huge I am totally stuffed Prices are reasonable for vegan food Oh and the brownies are quite tasty as well I recommend this to anyone vegan or not you will love it,Vegan Cave Cafe
Darius D.,2020-07-09,5,Im no vegan but that doesnt stop me from venturing out and enjoying the many vegan delicacies that exist Including pizza I was astonished how good pizza could be without meat It tasted amazing and felt super healthy using ingredients for the crust such as almond flour Usually I feel really bloated and unhealthy after eating regular pizza but I didnt have that feeling with Vegan Cave Cafes pizza,Vegan Cave Cafe
Karen N.,2021-02-23,5,The best vegan pizza Ive ever had The delito pizza was amazing and so were the staff Abraham and the other staff were so helpful kind and gave such great recommendations Also the desserts are so good Def try the New York cheesecake and chocolate Banana cake Really nice staff and very knowledgeable The mozzarella cheese was so good,Vegan Cave Cafe
Jennifer B.,2019-09-07,4,We read about this place and are so glad we made the trek over to Gastown to eat here Vancouver has a huge homeless population and this place is in the heart of it We walked and didnt drive but I dont think I would park my car in this area We arrived for a late lunch There were a few other people in the restaurant We ordered a pizza from the counter Everything is vegan and delicious Order came up with 25 minutes The crust was thin and crispy Really good stuff The four stars is for the location Food is five stars for sure,Vegan Cave Cafe
Sabina S.,2019-07-10,5,Whoa this place is amazing for vegans and non-vegans alike Its hard to find spots that do vegan pizza let alone do it well  Im continually wowed by the vegan options in Vancouver You can tell that the owner and folks who work here really put a ton of thought into the menu ingredients and recipes  it shows To start they offer three different varieties of crusts made fresh and in house Nutty Almond gluten free Casava gluten free too and organic wheat I love how they have figured out how to support all dietary restrictions  The menu is varied and interesting  sure to satisfy every palate and you can choose which crust you would like as well as build your own pizza entirely if you arent feeling the options We decided to go with the Bombay Badboy and the Buffalo Buddha On to the food The Buffalo Buddha was the star here holy moly The vegan blue cheese was seriously unreal  it tasted just like the real thing The wheat crust was the perfect thickness It also had chickpeas on it which I honestly would have never thought to put on pizza but it works so so well The chicken was made out of jackfruit and delicious They had definitely marinated it in buffalo sauce to make it super flavorful I havent had the best experience with jackfruit prior to this but they did it well Highly recommend ordering a side of their vegan ranch sauce to dip into because it worked really well with this pizza Also the vegan tapioca based mozzarella was equally unreal  I dont get how they achieve that melt The Bombay Badboy was also really good although we personally preferred the Buffalo Buddha more  The Chipotle Cilantro sauce they had on top was so tasty I loved the concept of an Indian-flavored pizza With this one we got a side of the Jalapeño Garlic sauce and I enjoyed the pairing but I also love spicy food  Overall the pizzas homemade crusts vegan cheese and vegan sauces were outstanding But to make things even better we ordered their cheesecake for dessert WHOA it was so good Im not a vegan and I honestly couldnt tell it didnt have dairy It was so fresh and fluffy We devoured the whole thing You gotta get it This place is the bomb Highly recommend going here whether you are vegan or not because the flavors and creativity will wow you  Oh and its a smaller establishment with casual seating  the perfect cozy environment Enjoy,Vegan Cave Cafe
Jess S.,2018-12-12,5,Thank you so much for creating another epic vegan pizza joint in the city Sister to the Caveman Cafe also excellent VCC offers homemade and delicious tasting pizzas Located in Gastwon/Tinstletown the place seats few but serves many The pizzas are homemade with 3 different crusts options 2 which are GF  casava or nut based I ordered half Pesto Prana sauted broccoli cashew ricotta on pesto sauce and half Freaky Greeky cashew feta garlic tomato olives red onion crushed walnuts on pesto and was pumped to see how big it was Add a side of ranch and this pizza blew my mind It was so delicious and very flavorful I almost cried Unlike Virtuos Pie which is equally good this place offers up more pizza like pizzas does that make sense Vegan meats dayia cheese as well as homemade and fresh ingredients I also added a cheese cake for dessert and it was by far the best dessert I have had in a long time The service was also impeccable They were fast and the efficient and the server was extremely sweet I 100% recommend this place Its going to be a huge hit  vegan or not,Vegan Cave Cafe
Shila B.,2020-06-30,5,I was recommended this place by a fellow foodie friend I am not Vegan and honestly vegan food is a little weird to me that is food that pretends to be meat but is vegan I dont hate it but I havent had really really good vegan food and the few that are are gems I had a pizza with cashew feta This was my first time having Cashew feta and it was actually pretty good The thin and crispy crust with the loaded vegan toppings actually tasted good I am honestly glad that they didnt use Diaya on my pizza cause that stuff is nasty to me that they used the nut based cheese It hasnt converted me into considering being vegan but places that can make decent vegan food gives me a different appreciation Prices are pricey but you do get what you pay for Super friendly staff,Vegan Cave Cafe
David A.,2020-09-16,1,I went to buy vegan desserts The selection of desserts had no PRICES item ingredients So I asked attendant He had no idea or told me there was no sugar then told me it was coconut sugar I asked him about another item he told me they were cheesecakes(but I thought it was vegan-when I questioned him he said cashew cheese))And then he proceeded to WIPE his nose with his hand Thoroughly disgusted I suggested to him that he was making it very difficult for me to buy anything form the vegan dessert section It seems to me the Vegan Cave is being run by a Middie Eastern oufit who are not conscious of basic business concepts of identification of items they are selling identifying whats in it or even basic hygiene practices Also NOT ONE STAFF MEMBER IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT WAS WEARING A MASK Nor were there any protocols in place that I could see,Vegan Cave Cafe
Neki T.,2019-10-27,2,The food bowl  pizza were great The service was pretty bad Grumpy people in the kitchen bored to death watching their cellphones all time Should be only for pick up as if you wanna go to the washroom you have to go through the kitchen Friendly advice if you wanna have arguments get out Its not nice watching you while we are eating,Vegan Cave Cafe
Samantha C.,2020-06-20,5,The taste and flavor of their pizza are to die for It didnt disappoint my picky stomach Ill definitely comeback soon Salad was good but i really enjoyed the pizzas,Vegan Cave Cafe
Gabriela F.,2019-07-22,5,This place is a GEM Amazing mouth Watering pizza great crusts both Whole-wheat and almond and the cheeses are beyond I imagined Say good bye to the days when the only vegan cheese available was daya Cave cheeses are top quality perfectly melting in the pizza Another great point is the size 15 for a 12 pizza is really good price My favorite so far is the pesto prana such a good combination Havent tried their bowls but they are very big for what Ive seen and are probably just as delicious as the pizzas,Vegan Cave Cafe
Heilige M.,2020-12-03,1,Well its vegan so expect some nasty food thats overpriced Just saying Or you could get real pizza,Vegan Cave Cafe
Ayaka H.,2019-02-23,5,After consistently perfect 5 star ratings do I really have to say more One of the biggest deterrents of going vegan is the misconception that one needs to give up pizza and cheese Vegan Cave Cafe is here to save your day and prove that a healthy and delicious vegan pizza can be made that tastes so close to the traditional pizza If you could eat two delicious pizzas but one was not made from the suffering of animals the veganized version would be your natural choice I was at the VCC 2 months ago with a friend and the warm and friendly customer service made a lasting impression Often times you can tell something is going to be real good by the pride of the staff members and that theory proved correct The pizza is to die for and the bonus is you wont feel yucky or bloated from them I will come back without a doubt the next time Im craving some real good pizza,Vegan Cave Cafe
Matt B.,2019-04-17,4,One of the best places in town for a vegan pizza that is somewhat of the artisan bent Small place with room for maybe 15 or 20 customers and also a good option for take-out Very creative pizza options available on either whole wheat crust or two different gluten free options for celiacs or those who buy into the gf fad Both pizzas we ordered were very tasty and left us very full 15 for a 12 is the only size which is pretty decent Friendly service and the pizzas came out in 10 minutes Definitely recommended,Vegan Cave Cafe
Mason J.,2019-05-24,5,When it comes to vegan pizza this place is the best My wife and I got the The Real Deal crust and the Buddha on the Beach and added chicken was so good,Vegan Cave Cafe
Chloe C.,2021-05-07,5,Feature items were all amazing Loved the chikn and waffles birria tacos and meatball sub Will go and try the fysh burger soon Cauliflower bowl was delicious too though the side slaw cucumber and rice felt unnecessary and I would have preferred just the cauliflower as an appetiser And of course you have to get the 3 staples kale caesar onion rings and yam fries,BeetBox
Jess S.,2021-10-26,4,Ok Ive come back several time as Ive been recommended it so many times Being vegan and straight in my hood I gave them another time x 10 I am a huge fan of their Crispy Cauliflower Bowl and I love it Its such a good mix of flavours and its huge I loved their meatball sandwich and their pizza sub These are part of their weekly specials and I cried when they got rid of the meatball one I also cried because they are not GF and it makes me sick but worth it Their chicken is packed with flavour and so crispy and flavourful Again not GF and I dont love the bread they use for their burgers but they do chicken the best in they city I am also a huge fan of their kale Caesar add bacon So delicious and filing Service is ALWAYS good They have exceptional staff and incredible prices I love that they sell their own house made products here as well,BeetBox
Matt B.,2021-05-16,4,Great vegan junk food for the odd occasion This place has been on my radar for some time but Id just never visited until now because its downtown and because I try not to eat junk food too often I had to try their esteemed chick-un sandwich specially the spicy Nashville Fried Chick-Un Sandwich 9.50 wjich was amply spicy and had a great texture  yum For sides we got the roast broccoli  mushroom XO sauce 6 which was oily but quite tasty and the yam wedges 6.50 which were tasty but covered with too much aioli for my tastes I wish the aioli came on the side Since we got our order to go I had hoped theyd include cutlery to eat the broccoli and napkins but we got neither so it was quite messy eating this in the park If you like vegan junk give them a try,BeetBox
Emily S.,2020-10-12,5,So over the moon with this thanksgiving sandwich I loved it so much we ordered 4 between us  Please please bring these back at Christmas or at least next year have them for the whole month of October I could eat this sandwich every single day its a great twist on their regular Seitan sandwich,BeetBox
Nami A.,2021-03-19,3,I really really wanted to like the food from here But unfortunately it was not as great as I thought it would be  Lets start with what could be improved so we can finish on a good note The fried chick-un sandwich looked like it had a good thick crust but its actually on the thinner side and the chicken on the inside is quite mushy Thats really as close as I can get to describing the texture It also does not have much flavour to it which was a bit disappointing The patty itself is thick but because there just isnt much flavour to it I ended up removing it and eating the sandwich without the patty It can also get a bit expensive paying 16 for fries and a sandwich I wouldnt have minded if I liked the food but it wasnt really palatable to me personally so that may be why the cost matters a bit more Ive also tried their Seitan Reuben Sandwich which I liked much better compared to their chicken sandwich However it does get quite greasy and if the sandwich gets cold you can really notice the grease But overall this sandwich is something I crave sometimes so although Im giving this establishment only 3 stars this sandwich is definitely something I would have again Now onto the good As mentioned above the Reuben sandwich is pretty good and I highly recommend trying it The bun they use for the chicken sandwich is soooooo good So good that I did not mind eating the sandwich sans patty Additionally they have an amazing selection of LOCAL kombucha that I also recommend trying Their yam wedges which Ive yet to try but have heard amazing reviews from my colleagues I think I will come back and give their warm bowls a try and update the review accordingly,BeetBox
Nicole B.,2021-04-17,2,I was craving some onion rings from here because they are bomb But I was dissatisfied with the beet salad  I have to keep it real The greens are from a regular grocery store and were OLD YUCK So disappointed,BeetBox
Kate M.,2021-02-02,5,UPDATE to 5 stars as Ive been back more than a couple times now to Beetbox and its so damn good I had to move my four stars to five My boyfriend is veggo and Im the meat eater so to find a joint we both agree upon in terms of junk food is really tricky to find but Beetbox has been our go to It seriously satisfies The chili cheese fries are honestly the MVP of the menu  the vegan cheese and chili is incredible The fries are perfectly crispy Takeaway they can get a little sogs but I dont even care the flavour is so good And theyve got an awesome spice to them I crave them often which is very dangerous The chick-un sandwich is my other go to on the menu as well as its a fabulous replacement for actual chicken Im a fried chicken obsessed person but if I wanna go less greasy plant based this is by far the best plant based sando or burger Ive ever had Cant recommend this place enough and if you are a meat eater check out Juke as well as its their other resto,BeetBox
Issabelle F.,2020-07-05,5,Yall Listen to me when I say Beetbox is LEGIT vegan comfort food at its finest Chefs Bryan and Justin knew exactly what they were doing when they crafted this entire menu because everything Ive tried has been delicious Most recently my brother and I ordered delivery from here We both ordered the Nashville Hot Chick-un sandwich both getting avocado inside and a set of onion rings to share I dont know if its because we were starving and exhausted but we both scarfed down our meals very quickly and in silence No crumb was left behind In the past Ive also had their bowls and cheeze fries which were filling and tasty as well The Nashville Hot Chick-un sandwich has been by far my favourite dish that Ive gotten from here though They use breaded and fried seitan as a meat replacement and personally if you blindly handed me this sandwich I would never know that I wasnt eating meat On top of that the flavour was impeccable the spice was perfect and the avocado was a really great touch Whether youre plant-based or a carnivore guaranteed youll love Beetbox As of right now they are still only offering takeout and delivery but their food is one that travels well so I encourage getting it delivered Thanks for consistently feeding me delicious vegan comfort food Beetbox SupportLocal,BeetBox
Nancy L.,2020-07-25,4,One of the best vegan fast food spots you can go to Fast food is in quotes because they serve fries burgers and etc but its not super quick serve which Im fine with Their seitan fried chicken sandwich is super tasty but the Nashville hot chicken sandwich is better Im a big fan of their chilli fries and their onion rings Their onion rings are battered in a spiced breading and it is so good I used to also always order a butternut squash salad but they seem to have taken it off the menu They accidentally gave me the Crispy Gordita once instead of the chilli fries and it was actually a really pleasant surprise Super tasty and very filling I actually ended up ordering it independently once after the accidental eating lol Most recently I ordered Kale Tahini Salad for takeaway It was really tasty crispy chickpeas = 10/10 with a tangy but creamy dressing However I was really underwhelmed by their portion size It was barely a third of the container full which was disappointing because I was hoping to have it as a main Despite that I am more than willing to continue being a regular at Beetbox,BeetBox
Ania D.,2020-11-20,3,We had the Fried Chick-un sandwich as well as the chilli cheese fries Also had some of the passion fruit kombucha Id like to preface this by saying that the staff were absolutely lovely So nice I wasnt a massive fan to be honest of the sandwich We had to ask from more sauce because I could barely taste the aioli which I was so excited about With the extra sauce it really bumped up the flavour but it didnt change the fact it was quite bready and the bites werent very consistent I dont know I just feel like it lacked flavour so maybe I shouldve ordered the spicy one As for the chili cheese fries Ive come to the realization that I personally dont think that I like chili cheese fries Something about a strong bell pepper taste is a little off-putting to me However if chili cheese fries are your thang I think you would probably enjoy these I also couldnt really tell that there was not meat in it I lowkey would give it 2 stars based on taste alone but when accounting for my personal food preferences as well as the amazing service it definitely gets bumped up which leads into a whole existential debate of yelp reviews what should you prioritize reviewing the taste the service the overall experience,BeetBox
Becky M.,2020-11-23,5,I finally ordered from here through Ubereats and Im glad I did Its been on my list for awhile it did not disappoint I ordered the Seitan burger which is called the Nashville Chick-Un Sandwich  It was as good as if not better than an actual crispy chicken burger Its a good portion filling and tasty I also ordered a jar of the Buddha sauce at 5 and a jar of spicy pickles at 7.50 both decent portions I look forward to ordering from here again and going to the restaurant when Covid 19 measures lift,BeetBox
Ruby B.,2020-10-26,3,Food was great for the most part Highly recommend the fries Big downside for eat in they dont require masks for food pick ups I lost my appetite after three unmasked people came into the small store and breathed less than 2 ft from the food I was eating Call me paranoid but it didnt feel comfortable Also the people who ordered pick up didnt need to sign in but those in the dining area did,BeetBox
Elizabeth K.,2020-08-10,5,This place is CRAZY good I got it delivered via doordash and it is incredible I got the nashville chickun sandwich the broccoli and the fries The fries were cooked to perfection The seitan chicken tasted like real chicken but better This is truly comfort food Highly recommend this place to anyone  not just vegans or plant based eaters It is seriously some of the best food ive had in Vancouver,BeetBox
Elvi R.,2020-07-21,4,Great option if youre in the West End and want to splurge Ive been here twice and both times wasnt impressed with their famous Fried Chick-Un Sandwich I found the patty to be way too mushy and it doesnt work with the bread cause it gets soggy and everything falls apart when youre eating it I have had way better vegan fried chicken elsewhere I do recommend other items on their menu instead like the Chili Cheeze Fries or their Crispy Gordita or even their Burger with Cheeze are probably my favourite items here Its a cute little place and great to grab takeout and eat it at the beach,BeetBox
Heather M.,2019-12-20,5,Try not to make the mistake I made by ordering everything on the menu dont under estimate how filling each of these delicious dishes are  a great alternative to Meet in Yaletown Got there around 6 oclock it wasnt busy at all but then suddenly the place filled up its not that big so if you have the option to go during an off time or get there before the rush comes then go for it they also have takeout if I had to choose between the gordita the chorizo hotdog or the chicken sandwich I think I would recommend the gordita but do come back and try the rest,BeetBox
Harmony C.,2021-04-07,3,I wanted to like this place so much Ive been there twice and had the same meal perhaps the other menu items are really great but Im not sure how likely I am to go back I ordered the fried unchicken sandwich both times everything about it is good until you get to the middle of it there is just too much seitan The middle of the fried chicken is a big lump of soggy seitan that I had to throw away a thinner patty would be PERFECT On top of that the fries were painfully salty both times I went,BeetBox
Iris L.,2020-07-19,5,I ordered from here via Door Dash I decided to try the Fried Chick-Un Sandwich with a side of French Fries The Fried Chick-Un Sandwich as written on their website is breaded and fried seitan miso aioli iceberg and spicy pickled cucumber Although seemingly simple the sandwich as a whole is packed with flavour and is quite filling too The combination of the crunchy seitan paired with the creamy aioli on the warm bun is a sensational mix complementing one another well As for the French Fries theres just something so standout about them that no other could compare to Theyre both perfectly crisped and well-seasoned and never seem to disappoint If youre looking for a meal that embodies the genre of comfort food for a hungry vegan youll find that here,BeetBox
Colin L.,2019-11-15,4,Always excited to try a new Vegan place out Ive eaten lunch at this restaurant a couple of times now and am overall impressed with the food service and staff I really like the feel of dining room its bright and open feeling with family style long tables There were also a ton of food delivery services picking up orders The onion rings here are over the top good thats right I was eating onion rings for lunch dont judge me and the crunchy batter is perfect It is the same batter used for the Chick Un Sandwich which wasnt 100% my texture preference but it certainly had delicious pickles ask for extra to accompany it I REALLY enjoyed Curry Cauliflower Salad the sprouted legumes are a nice touch as are the crispy chickpeas The only complaint is about the serving size which is a smaller than I would expect especially for a 12 item Next time Im totally trying out their Crispy Gordita,BeetBox
Sangeetha M.,2019-11-06,5,Wow this place blew my mind Im not a fan of fake meat but the seitan fried chickun sandwich was soooo good I prefer it over most real chicken burgers I tried two salads carrot Farro avocado salad and roasted squash salad which were great too I especially enjoyed the roasted squash salad I ordered from here through foodora so Im not sure if its the same prices but the only downside I would say is that it was expensive for what it is The chickun sandwich was 11.25 and small Salads were 14.50 each The portion of the salads were big though so Id say its well worth it,BeetBox
Olivia R.,2019-10-18,5,5 stars for both food and service plus the place is super trendy Kevin greeted us when we came in and definitely ensured we had a great experience He was so bright and cheerful too which helped as it was pouring rain today For food I ordered the gordida and my friend got the chickun butger we split onion rings as well The gordida was AMAZING The flavor was there just the spice I love My friend said her chickun burger tasted just like a real one The onion rings were super crunchy and the sauce was well balanced I am so happy we stumbled upon this chic and trendy spot on Instagram While I am not often in that end of downtown I will definitely come back and will be suggesting this place to all my vegan/vegetarian friends,BeetBox
Kevin O.,2021-10-04,5,Omg the food and service at the restaurant is amazing best Lebanese food in Vancouver,Nuba in Gastown
Jess S.,2021-10-17,2,Disappointed with the meals we ordered via delivery on a Friday at 7 pm I have been to this specific location on multiple occasions and have LOVED it But when ordering take out we were so disappointed with the poetion sizes which is not typical when dining in-house especially the tabouli salad I think between both meals we maybe got 2 tbs worth if salad looks big because its laying on too of the hummus and baba  but it was a sprinkle of salad  see picture We ordered the La Feast This Price is for 2 49.50 Two course vegetarian mezze sampler including hummus baba ghanooj olives pickles feta taboulleh Najibs Special falafel mjadra vegan stew  fattoush salad Served with hot sauce tahini sauce  tzatziki We also never got tzatziki and the tabouleh serving was a joke Fewer olives and just not what is typical We also ordered the Le Grande Feast This Price is for 2 Guests 69.90 Two course sampler including hummus baba ghanooj tabouleh olives pickles feta fattoush salad Najibs Special roasted potatoes lamb chops spiced prawns  chicken skewers Again not much taboulleh which I assume they ran out of and no tzatziki We also only got one dip each of the hot sauce and tahini Delivery is more expensive and less than what is expected at this price Delivery is not worth it in my opinion and is really disappointing Food is always delicious but disappointed with being snubbed on a few dishes We complained to the delivery app and no response,Nuba in Gastown
Rebecca C.,2021-09-04,3,I have several people recommending this place so I came with high expectations But I was very underwhelmed The best dish was red lentil soup but would recommend a little bit more lemon juice and salt with it The pickled red cabbage that came with a lot of the dishes was excellent accompaniment to elevate the flavors Our 1.5 yo loved it and had a whole bowl Tabouleh was dry Lamb hushwie was too gamey for our taste  may benefit from more onion sauteed with it Perhaps my days spent in Paris where many Lebanese restaurants had to compete for business made my standards a bit too high so take my advice was a grain of salt There was no coursing concept at this place Whatever you order it will come out within minutes Be prescriptive if you dont want all of your dishes come out at once,Nuba in Gastown
Sylvia Y.,2021-10-23,4,First time trying from the Nuba restaurants Went to the Gaston location as it was closer to work it is slightly tucked away as a below grade storefront for reference it is located right on the corner of the block across from Victory Square and Meat  Bread Id assume dine in wouldve been a great experience the ambience of the interior decor is very cozy Overall my takeout order was delicious I enjoyed the option to go half and half on the rice potato option The salad was well dressed very tasty overall Would definitely visit again,Nuba in Gastown
Dave S.,2021-09-01,5,Had the cauliflower Nabils Special based on the waitresss recommendations and it was great  not greasy big portions flavorful and healthy at the same time The Turkish coffee was also very enjoyable,Nuba in Gastown
David H.,2021-10-31,4,4 stars Great atmosphere Awesome food Lots of choice off the menu Tables a bit on the small side but adequate Large share platter consisted of lots of variety well presented of highest quality satisfying Meat portions were noticeably very underwhelming relative to pricing Servers provided diligent service were exceptionally busy and appeared stretched as the evening progressed Washrooms could use a refresh at busy times Overall a good experience As always for real You be the judge,Nuba in Gastown
Kristine E.,2021-09-04,5,Spectacular food One of the best babaganush duos Ive ever had We did the meat tasting menu and the only disappointing part was that we were leaving the next day and couldnt take our leftovers Super nice service great drinks We made reservations and very glad we did  it was packed,Nuba in Gastown
Claire M.,2020-12-30,5,visited summer 2019 This place is kinda hard/not obvious to find if youre not from Vancouver but oh is it worth the effort from what I remember you have to walk down stairs from the street sidewalk and it looks closed but its not or something   This was place was heavenly in every way Probably the best Mediterranean food I have ever had If youre in Vancouver eat here one night  dim lighting and small tables so would be an AWESOME date spot or just a fun catch up with a friend like I did ,Nuba in Gastown
Deez N.,2021-08-02,5,Ive walked by Nuba countless times when visiting Vancouver but never took the opportunity to dine Im so upset that it took me so long I visited Nuba with my wife and friends We ordered falafel lunch Najibs special lamb meatballs and and steak skewers We left satisfied and extremely happy with all the flavours and great services I was quite surprised by tasty jalapeño sauce which offered a nice kick,Nuba in Gastown
Jackie S.,2021-07-03,1,Ok I am SO confused Just placed an order by Uber eats and had the worst meal of my life  which even worse was a REMARKABLE rip-off 63 including a %15 tip It was basically not enough food for two  and nothing about it was even edible The halloumi was sweet and bland and I mean less than a quarter cup for 17 The crispy cauliflower and potatoes both were soggy and seemed boiled Just gross and disappointing This is the entire meal My small hand for scale I mean  the halloumi Edit to add  threw it in the bin What a waste,Nuba in Gastown
Eva D.,2021-10-21,2,Spider in our salad alive Told the waitress about it and she just offered us a new salad which we politely declined You would think the restaurant would care and have someone come over to talk to us as we were mortified but nothing no offeting us an appetizer in its place nothing they honestly dont care about service as you can see if other reviews Will not be coming back or advising friends or colleagues to visit,Nuba in Gastown
Laura L.,2020-08-08,3,Ate here for the first time after having read so many great reviews Unfortunately we were underwhelmed by the flavours We were excited by the many vegetarian options The halloumi dish was by far the star of our meal the sauce on top was absolutely delicious to balance out the saltiness of the cheese We also enjoyed the fatoush salad But otherwise the vegan stew falafels and lentil dish were quite bland And all the sauces were nothing to write home about Perhaps we are spoiled in Montreal with so many wonderful Lebanese restaurants but we will not be eating here again especially given the hefty price,Nuba in Gastown
Amy C.,2019-10-25,4,Came here for dinner and got the dip trio cauliflower and lamb entrée to share Pleasantly surprised with the dips especially the carrot A must try The cauliflower was delicious but as expected Lamb entrée was what actually let me down unfortunately I am usually a super big fan of lamb but the lamb I got was a little tough and one chunk was pure fat A few ups and downs but overall pretty decent restaurant and nice ambiance,Nuba in Gastown
Glen M.,2019-12-01,5,Okay uhhh-yummm How awesome was our lunch today Im sure this spot has been haunted for years I can picture it from 100 years ago with bar brawls every night Also it kinda looks like Jabbas lair And yes that adds to why I loved this place  and not to mench the food was amazing Sooo good We just ordered some dishes from the happy hour menu and everything was delicious Cauliflower trio of hummus lentil stew olives feta Was all there and all of it was super tasty The service was great too Hungry again,Nuba in Gastown
Dianna H.,2019-08-05,3,I seem to be in the minority here but I thought my experience here was just okay Good ambiance but not all the dishes were good Its definitely a great spot for vegetarians and vegans though as maybe half the menu is vegan/vegetarian friendly and marked clearly gluten free too My friend and I came for Saturday dinner around 6:45 and was seated within minutes We came at the right time since a lot of the patrons had just left or were about to leave for a concert nearby First thing you notice is the cozy set up Its dim and felt quite intimate Great for dates Id imagine We were super hungry and probably ordered a little more than we should have...if youre going the tapas route for reference 2 small plates per person should suffice but we ordered 5 and was really struggling to finish it near the end We tried marks my favorites Red lentil soup 6.50 for small favorite dish of the meal for both of us The lentils were cooked thoroughly and had the perfect amount of flavor Najibs special 12 we ordered this on the servers recommendation as its one of their most popular items Its essentially fried cauliflower served with a tahini dipping sauce I dont know how else to describe this other than that the cauliflower flavor really comes through so Id recommend this for cauliflower fans Chicken shish tawook 13 two skewers of chicken breast is served on top of hummus with avocado and pickled veggies on the side This was okay but nothing special The breast meat was okay for what it was but Im just not a huge fan of breast meat in general Garden falafel 11.50 the falafels are the reason we ate here My friend has been here before and absolutely loves them I tried one and thought they were pretty standard but Im also not big on falafels Lamb hushwie 13 was disappointed by this dish I thought it would be a hot dish but the minced lamb was slightly chilled As I reflect back on my meal over the course of writing this review I think part of why my experience here was lackluster is because the dishes were served in a very similar fashion Everything was served on top of hummus with some avocado or pickled veggies on the side so other than changing the protein there wasnt much variety I also didnt like the flatbread they gave us to eat with everything Im definitely not an expert but it tasted a bit overcooked and dry,Nuba in Gastown
Yuri Y.,2019-11-09,5,Pretty awesome Lebanese place Only been here once for dinner so far and they have good cocktail selection good food I had the 4 items in the photos The lamb was my favorite Fatty but done just right so it got crispy on the outside Pita was cold and below expectations Apart from that I liked this place and will definitely frequent Lunch is also great I had the Chicken Tawook plate and it was amazing We got there early but managed to get out in 40 mins which is pretty good,Nuba in Gastown
Ting A.,2019-10-19,2,This place is highly reviewed and Im disappointed that I didnt like this place as much as I had hoped Both the dishes in the menu and their pictures looked so good too Lunch plates are served with hummus salad pickled cabbage olives and choice of organic brown rice or roasted potatoes Pita on the side is included as well with tahini and hot sauce  Falafel Lunch Plate Victors secret recipe of organic chickpeas fava beans veggies and spices 16 To me the falafels were dry pickled cabbage was too strong in flavor roasted potatoes and salad were average and I dont care too much for olives So the pita and the hummus were the tastiest parts of the meal but even those were standard compared to other places  Nubas Chicken Tawook Lunch Plate grilled mount lehman chicken breast marinated in paprika thyme lemon and garlic confit 17 ,Nuba in Gastown
Jordan N.,2019-10-12,4,This is the third time Ive been to this nuba location but first trying the supper menu The place definitely has a different vibe at night with candles and a more crowded room The supper menu isnt too big but its enough The service was alright and we were served in a fair amount of time I ordered the Mama Dallouah 12 and Braised Brisket Stew 26 which was a decent appetizer into main dish combo The appetizer was a beet pommegranite garlic mix with garlic bread to dip It was pretty damn tasty but not presented very well The brisket was also tasty with the beef gravy seeping into the potato mash I wish the main course came with a couple more vegetables as I finished them much before I was done with the beef n potatoes There lunch menu is definitely more bang for your buck The vibe downstairs for supper is pretty darn nice but the menu left me a bit to be desired If Id come again Id try the feast combos which require a minimum of two to join in into Maybe then my ratings will boost back up Otherwise this experience was a decent 4,Nuba in Gastown
Richard U.,2019-10-05,3,3.5 star place Lebanese restaurant with lots of things you dont usually see on the menu Stuff tried Najibs special aka fried cauliflower I love a good fried cauliflower Comes with tahini and jalapeno mint dipping sauce Halloumi cheese served seared with tomatoes Chewy with good flavor Vegan stew this one is pumpkin or squash based with onions tomatoes and chick pea over brown rice Hearty and filling Comes with pita which you probably dont need Very vegetarian friendly with also an array of vegan options Food came out quite fast as well The gastown location is below street level and has an intimate feel It gets busy for dinner and recommend reservations,Nuba in Gastown
Nikita P.,2019-06-04,5,Love this place The ambiance is very cute cozy dim and candle lit The food is exceptional Enjoyed the Hummus Vegan Stew Crispy Cauliflower Lamb Kafta Baba Ghanooj Chicken Tawook with Hummus Red Lentil Soup but my most favorite was their Pistachio Cake dessert I came here for the first time when I was pregnant and had been craving their dessert for two years When I went back this time it was just as delicious as I had remembered it to be,Nuba in Gastown
Chloe C.,2020-04-23,5,Went here another time before COVID hit and even then the bento boxes were limited to just takeout I also got a bunch of frozen items to stock up which was a good call since restaurants all shut down a couple of days later Again the items are quite pricey but you can tell that the meals are made with care and they taste like authentic japanese home cooking They also make me feel really healthy which is always a plus Bento Box 5/5 This bento box was literally amazing and I could not have been happier with my meal The bento of the day was tofu isobe which was basically tofu carrot and daikon wrapped in deep fried seaweed In essence it was a sushi roll without rice The taste was unique and was very light and refreshing despite the seaweed which was not oily at all There was one slice of sweet potato which was good and there was also some sort of vegan fish cake which was absolutely delicious There were some other accompaniments like shredded carrot and burdock which were good but nothing mind-blowing The bento also came with brown rice and some sort of japanese plum thing which I didnt like Yam and Black Bean Zucchini Loaf 5/5 This is probably my favourite frozen item from them to date This was similar but the better upgraded version of the Yam and Black Bean Loaf I got last time This loaf tasted wonderful The flavours are mild but unique It has quinoa yam puree and black beans and I think the zucchini was a thin pureed layer on top Im not too sure where the zucchini was Im slightly confused but it was tasty so its all good It was a tad mushy but thats probably because it was frozen and the ice inside melted I really enjoyed this Kabocha Gratin 5/5 This had the same filling as the kabocha croquettes that I last time except it doesnt have the breadcrumbs and it has quinoa in it Other than that it still has the chickpeas and pumpkin puree with a thin crust on top Again the flavours were mild but it tasted really comforting Kabocha Croquettes 3.5/5 These croquettes were different from last time in that they tasted nothing like pumpkin Instead it tasted like tomato sauce and the inside was reddish-orange It has like one chickpea and one red kidney bean inside and some dried tomatoes It probably has pumpkin puree to hold the whole thing together but you just cant taste it Its not bad but its not the kabocha croquette that I loved last time Misleading advertising Vegan Gyoza 3.5/5 These would have been perfect except there was something in the filling that tasted like cilantro and I hate cilantro or whatever that herb was These gyozas are huge and have a generous amount of filling which consisted of lentils and spring onions The dumpling wrapper was great as well Its just a shame about the cilantro Chickpea and Millet Nuggets 3.5/5 This was an interesting take on a chicken nugget Obviously the filling was soft and mushy on the inside but the flavour was decent though pretty mild like most of their other items The breadcrumbs were not as crispy as I would have liked them to be and the outer layer was hard and crunchy not in a good way Overall it was okay but I probably wont be getting them again Tempeh Chili 3/5 This was a little disappointing The tomato sauce was a little acidic perhaps due to it being a frozen item The taste was too strong and overpowering and left a strange taste in my mouth afterwards There was no tempeh in it and I feel cheated The eggplants and mushrooms in the chili tasted weird and not fresh I know it was made a while ago but still and I would not get this item again Garbanzo Stroganoff 3/5 This was also rather disappointing The sauce tasted weird not sure if its because it was frozen and the mushrooms tasted weird Note to self dont buy frozen items with mushrooms eggplants or tomatoes in them It came with chickpeas carrots celery and mushrooms Again it was just okay and I would not get this item again,Tama Organic Life
Suzan L.,2019-02-01,5,Amazing place Vegetables are fresh and decor was absolutely adorable The owners are kind and welcoming Had the daily bento special which was a bowl with some patties pickled vegetables gomae brown rice quinoa and more It came with a bowl of the best miso soup I ever had the secret is apparently that they make it with a splash of soy milk Everything was tasty and blew me away Especially the spicy mayo sauce on top of the bowl That was something else I will definitely be back for more food and produce,Tama Organic Life
Samantha W.,2018-03-29,5,This place is sooooooo adorable They sell fresh produce dry goods sauces etc and all types of cute handmade things like unique slippers handmade by Japanese seniors They also have a vegan menu that you can eat in or take out I tried the rainbow wrap it was honestly SOOOO delicious The sauce they make and put in it...so fresh and flavourful Plus all the veggies in the wrap were organic and the wrap itself was gluten free and house made I cant wait to try everything else on the menu The owner and employees are so friendly Such a cute place I love it here,Tama Organic Life
Matt B.,2019-12-05,3,I came for lunch and ordered the large bento box 17++ Reasonable portion with lots of different dishes mostly cold different than most Japanese places The main dish in there was a squash dish that was tasty Very healthy options  low oil low salt low fat I dont dig the organic thing  it aint healthier nor is it more environmentally-friendly so I dont like paying a premium for no benefit But despite this gripe the meal was tasty,Tama Organic Life
Lauren L.,2015-08-08,5,Tama Organic Ethical Kitchen and Van Soba have a natural and healthy working relationship When I am able to make my way across three cities to get here for the Bento Box I dont ask what is in it I just order and know that it will be wholesome healthy and delicious I crave this food and the fact its all organic and vegan is a big plus Dont forget to have the soba Both are around 15 and it takes some time to get it ready to serve before you can eat It is very much well worth the wait Here patience is truly a virtue Healthy Japanese food at its best More people should learn about macrobiotic foods,Tama Organic Life
Michael H.,2017-03-28,5,Just want to thank hiroko-san the owner for her great work and passion for healthy natural eating She is such a friendly and informative lady She was happy to educate us with her tips and tricks My girlfriend and I commute from richmond to purchase some of their products We especially love their handmade natto japanese fermented soy beans and eggs that are hand picked from 60 or so happy chickens at a local farm They also make snacks and lunches there which are all such high quality with very generous portions Were happy to find such a gem at their new location Strongly recommend for anyone who is looking for a grocery store that has your health in mind first,Tama Organic Life
Darylle J.,2017-05-23,5,Wow Ive lived within walking distance for more than half a year and I wish I knew sooner that they served vegan Japanese lunch I will definitely be a regular here This place is the bomb Go support this local shop and their delicious nutritious food ,Tama Organic Life
Shila B.,2015-08-12,4,Lately Ive been drawn to hole in the wall places as they proved to be treasures to me This was a treasure that I was drawn to Its small menu was of decent size I loved the mini grocery store Customer service was awesome It was nice to eat somewhere and not have to worry about dietary restrictions,Tama Organic Life
Lo B.,2019-02-18,5,Discovered this place after visiting the farmers market and was blown away by the quality AND quantity of products this little store has Ive been looking for alternatives to the likes of TT for so long but gave up on ever finding an east Asian let alone specifically Japanese grocer that carried local organic and fair trade goods The owner Hiroko is as friendly and knowledgeable as it gets and I cant wait to come back to try more stuff as well as one of the amazing-looking bento boxes She also is very anti-plastic so if you come in with your own containers she will happily fill them and reuse the baggies,Tama Organic Life
Jenny G.,2019-07-25,3,Been here approximately seven times usually for lunch Bought dried beans and seeds also Service and prepared food is very good and price is  They have some very unique and interesting products for sale Unfortunately one was a dried up expensive specialty lotion They also took over a month to obtain one of the specialty enzymes so I canceled The store has a musty-humid atmosphere because most of the store is healthy organic produce There are magazines to read that arent usually seen in stores Think of this place as a health food store without the pills They have their own organic Natto which is very hard to find,Tama Organic Life
Simon K.,2013-03-19,4,Thanks to Larry ended up finding this place and you could call this your hole-in-the-wall organic mini produce mart Located on the backside armpit of the Ethical Kitchen this place can definitely be hard to find I had no idea where I was going but the map led me here and I walked around and eventually found it If you find the Ethical Kitchen its there off to the left side and a little door guides you into this warm cozy place When you enter and if there are people ordering food you maybe in for a roadblock of people at the doorway This place is tiny cramped has a small kitchen that they cook up soba noodles in the front with the cash register and extends in an elongated way the store is long for what it is and they make use of every space they have available The Japanese lady has a great happy smile to her and greets everyone who comes through the door For the size you will be amazed how much stuff is crammed in here Many items are labeled in both English and Japanese as this store is definitely tailored to the Japanese crowd she did mistake my dear for a Japanese person as her eyes were wide open and you could see excitement in her head from coming in to see they serve soba noodles here We did try the noodles here and brought back the plates and they even asked for her name We definitely will come back based on the warm hospitality and the food served here it is a hidden gem and if you dont see it you wouldnt believe it,Tama Organic Life
Fil C.,2017-11-27,5,The vegan bento was an amazing collection of flavors and textures which was completely unique The ladies serving lunch were super friendly and we had a pleasant conversation about Japanese food After finishing lunch I bought some apples from their collection of local organic produce,Tama Organic Life
James P.,2017-11-25,5,Nice little organic cafe Lots of macrobiotic and vegetarian dishes Good tea Lots of Japanese food supplies Quality attentiveness local produce The owner is very friendly and sweet,Tama Organic Life
Anabel C.,2018-05-06,4,I was looking for a vegan eatery near PNE and found Tama Tama is a small and cozy place  Sit down and eat on a picnic bench and get to know your fellow neighbour  I had the Nato burger bento box while my little one snacked on sugar peas Both of us enjoyed the food she picked away at my bento box too I especially liked the produce You can sit down to eat and then buy the necessities i.e fruit veggies teas and raw chocolate,Tama Organic Life
Jason F.,2015-11-11,5,Tama is the place to go when youre looking for healthy not to mention authentic Japanese vegetables and plants like shiso and really great service The staff remember you well and offer free samples of food too If you dont live in North Vancouver it can be a bit of a trip but its well worth it,Tama Organic Life
B T.,2015-03-15,5,The staffs were very friendly I had reserved a bento box the day before and went to pick it up along with an amazing homemade amazake rice pudding which I was allowed to try on the spot The 10 vegetarian box was good and made with local organic ingredients This store also sells quite a few selections of local produces as well as fish chicken and Japanese products,Tama Organic Life
Matt B.,2021-11-02,5,Update this place is still awesome Weve come here many times over the past couple years and the food is always high-quality Sometimes the service is a bit haphazard  forgetting certain items or with significant delays both for dine-in and take-out  but you always can forgive it for the food quality My only real complaint is it tends to be on the oily side  even compared to other Vietnamese and Asian restaurants They seem to update their menu regularly adding  removing certain dishes and modifying others This latest time we ordered way too much food but it was all excellent Bahn Xeo Crepe 18  Id seen people order this a few times and finally decided to try it Now it comes with plant-based prawns which are an interesting texture and totally un-fishy thankfully Other than that its mostly bean sprouts inside The crepe is somewhat crunchy and quite oily but very tasty 4.5/5 Black Garlic Eggplant 15  Perfectly cooked eggplant with a sweet garlicy sauce that works well over the rice You get a bit of steamed bok choy on the side Very good 4.5/5 XO Green Beans 13  Im a sucker for Asian green beans and these hit the spot Oily savoury and lightly sweet with a great garnish of garlic and fried onion served atop crispy vermicelli Really tasty 5/5 Lettuce Wrap 14  this is advertised as coming with tempeh but it only came with a few small pieces and instead came with a lot of fried tofu and diced veggies cooked into a swimming pool of oil Its tasty sure but this one seemed too different than advertised and is just too over-the-top oily 3.5/5 Mushroom Vermicelli 15  the best part of this dish are the little spring rolls and the garnish on top of the vermicelli If you dont mix this in with the noodles enough youll be left with very plain flavourless noodles underneath Very tasty dish though 4.5/5 Papaya Salad 13  done very well seasoned perfectly and comes with some nice bean curd skin sheet strips on top Really good 5/5 If you havent tried this place what are you waiting for,Do Chay
John S.,2021-09-06,4,Interesting vegetarian take on Viennese food at Do Chay on Kingsways We started out with Spring Rolls 9 Banh Xeo Crepe 18 Spring Rolls seems on point The Coconut Rice Cakes seems a bit doughy but not sure if theyre suppose to be like that Then ordered entrees to share Vegan Prawn Curry 15 Saigon Spaghetti 15 Satay Noodles 15 The curry had nice flavor and interesting plant based prawns The spaghetti was a bit spicy and wasnt expected Satay Noodle and rich peanut flavor and the favorite out of the 3 A place I wont be interested in coming back again to try some other flavors,Do Chay
JenJen C.,2021-08-24,4,I love this place Everything taste so good Im not sure if they ave much vegetables options but I mostly order their famous dish and it was mostly deep fried a bit too heavy at the end of the meal Services are really nice Its a place I would definitely go back,Do Chay
Christina L.,2021-09-30,2,Im sorry to say that this is the worst vegan meal I have ever eaten We ordered many items and nothing tasted good The vegan pho broth was completely bland the noodles were so mushy they broke apart immediately The broth was not hot enough to cook the sprouts The monsoon roll tasted like herbs but that was it The daikon cakes werent bad but really nothing special Ive definitely had much better papaya salad elsewhere Service was almost non existent as we ran out of water and no one came to refill,Do Chay
Karen F.,2021-05-31,5,My new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vancouver We have had take out once and dined in person this afternoon I would reorder every dish not missing meat for a second I am not a vegan or strict vegetarian but aim for mostly plant-based Of course in person dining the presentation is lot nicer and fried items were crispier but really most of it made the trip through DoorDash just fine after we reheated a bit in the oven Dishes we have shared include the Uncle Hings Wings Coco Rice Cakes Papaya Salad  so good had this twice  Jackfruit Lettuce Wrap  todays favorite Sweet and Spicy Bowl  definitely getting this again and Vegan Pho Portions are large We have had leftovers both times Service was very friendly modern covid friendly clean decor and there is a small patio out back if you prefer to eat outdoors,Do Chay
Stephanie T.,2021-05-25,4,Ive had this place bookmarked for awhile and finally got to try a couple of their dishes Everything was very tasty and satisfying Satay noodles I loved the spicy peanut broth It was so creamy and delicious There were a decent amount of toppings including roasted broccoli and cauliflower There were also 3 pieces of seitan which are these super tasty fried bits of gluten I probably felt like the portion for this was a little small as they were so good that I wanted more The noodles were a yellow colour which I didnt expect and came all stuck together at the bottom of the bowl However once I added in the soup they separated nicely and had a nice chewy texture Monsoon wraps the portion came with 3 rolls The pineapple sauce was very fresh and I could really taste the pineapple It went well with the wrap which had a nice crunch and lots of fresh herb filling I didnt really notice the tofu but they were still very tasty Surprisingly even after sharing the noodles and having 1 salad roll each my boyfriend and I felt full So these are definitely a good value and non-vegetarian eaters should not be worried I would definitely recommend trying this place out even if you arent vegetarian or vegan I really want to try the desert island noodles next,Do Chay
Maling S.,2021-09-07,5,Who knew Saigon vegetarian would taste so good Walking by or driving by Do Chay on Kingsway always have queues I made reservations and I can attest why they are so busy with walk ins The Coconut Rice Cakes was recommended by the server and first bite I was in flavour heaven with the sweetness from coconut and tampered with seared rice and herbs Spring Rolls are super crispy and delicious Wrap the spring roll with mustard green and herbs Every bite with a crunch with fresh vegetables and mint Saigon noodle had good flavour and packed with heat My favourite is the Satay Noodles drenched in peanut and sesame sauce Vegan Prawn Curry was also delicious with coconut curry with plant based prawns tofu and vegetables I need to come back to try more dishes from their extensive menu,Do Chay
Hanna K.,2021-02-06,5,Im typically not a huge fan of vegan/vegetarian restaurants because 1 the food tends to be flavourless 2 overpriced 3 small portions However Do Chay has consistently blown me away with their FLAVOURFUL dishes Everything was so tasty Their coconut rice cakes are a MUST Their rice bowls curry noodles jackfruit lettuce wraps salad rolls spring rolls everything was literally perfection Their dishes are unique  leaves you feeling full from all the vegetables Thanks Do Chay Yall are killin it,Do Chay
Ceci L.,2021-01-17,4,Im not a vegetarian but enjoyed the food here Prices are reasonable and portions are big and good for sharing Started off with the spring rolls It was light and crispy and not overly oily I really liked the banh xeo crepe It was huge and came with tons of greens They have two noodles  soup items on their menu vegan pho and bun bo hue The vegan pho was pretty much vegetable noodle soup and lacked flavour Ill stick to meat-based pho broths I enjoyed the bun bo hue it was a lot more flavourful However I came back a 2nd time and the bun bo hue broth seemed watered down My least favourite dish was the salted egg yolk eggplant It sounded unique and I love salted egg yolk but this just doesnt mix well with eggplant,Do Chay
Shannon K.,2021-03-01,5,I tried this cute little place since my friend is vegan I am not and it was really good We ordered Uncle Hings wings  fried mushrooms must order The seasoning was SO flavourful Grilled eggplant  came with rice and veggies also I would def order again Coco rice cakes  these were good but I didnt love the coconut hint They are a restaurant favourite though Jackfruit lettuce wraps  also very good This was one of my friends faves Monsoon wraps  dry chewy not very tasty haha I would highly recommend especially if you are vegetarian even if youre not but you cant really beat using meat products in Vietnamese food so I prob wont go back out of my way unless Im catering to my friends diet,Do Chay
Mrs H.,2021-06-07,5,Im really impressed with this place  The are definitely on point  Ive been back so many times for take out and dine in Ive almost tried every dish here and they all have been super delish I dont even know where to start Uncle hings wings are so good Oyster mushrooms are sooo good  Nice and a great kick The bun bo hue is the only one that I feel should maybe not have so much Lemongrass in there Its cut up into little bits and you will get a mouthful which isnt the easiest to eat so maybe if they smashed it in the broth  The spicy sesame bowl isnt spicy at all  But the other dishes have a good enough of spice in them  Other than that  right now this would be my go to vegan restaurant You wont be disappointed,Do Chay
Sayoka H.,2021-01-20,4,My third visit to Do Chay This is an updated review from my 1st visit there were lots of communication problem with walk-in seating and was given the wrong quote time but through my friends strong recommendation I decided to give it another shot From the three visits I would say the pot stickers are delicious The sauce is delicious and the filling is sweet and tangy I really enjoyed the presentation The dessert noodles had a very coconut-ty sweet taste and the portion size is shareable My friend ordered the Mushroom Vermicelli and it tastes better with the Fish Sauce on the noodles Overall service was great food took a little long to hit the table due to numerous uber eats orders I do recommend this vegetarian restaurant to meat-lovers wanting to try vegetarian food I love the Asian fusion mix and enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant,Do Chay
Clara Y.,2020-11-14,4,Ive been meaning to come here but covid and limited seating makes it so hard I opted for delivery the first time and ordered the satay noodles vegan bun bo hue black garlic eggplant kabocha curry bowl Satay Noodles Yummy This was definently one of the best things I ordered The broth was rich flavorful and yummy My dad loved it and hes hard to please Vegan pho I wasnt a fan of the smell of the broth but ordered this for my mom Its not bad but I definetly had better Bun bo hue Yum this was good definently better than Chau veggies bun bo hue A must order for any bun bo hue lovers Kombocha curry bowl I wish I had this for dine in There wasnt much sauce and I really hate it when restaurants do that I think itd be best if they were to separate the curry sauce from the rice so the rice doesnt soak up all the sauce But this was good I just wish I ordered it in person to see how its like Black garlic eggplant Ordered this due to the reviews but maybe I got in for takeout so it wasnt the same Not sure why this was a hit but this was the most underwhelming one we ordered Theres no flavor and again if there was sauce the sauce has been soaked up by the rice Ended up having to put fish sauce and chili oil to make it better I enjoyed all the food and wil definitely go in and check them out,Do Chay
Kristie W.,2020-09-27,5,Completely exceeded my hopes and expectations Its my first time here and my favourites are the XO potstickers and satay noodles The potstickers are the tastiest potstickers Ive ever had meat and veggie potstickers included The potsticker skins filling and sauce together made me a bit upset that there are only 5 pieces in one order The satay noodles are so loaded with flavours that you cant pin point each individual one but you taste the rainbow with each mouthful Love that its loaded with veggies Also like that it introduced me to seitan which essentially tastes like whatever it gets soaked in The salted egg eggplant is also so interesting and yummy The first few bites made me wish it had a sweet and spicy sauce to go with it but I grew to be very fond of it Now if only Do Chay had a dessert menu hoping for their take on deep fried banana with ice cream,Do Chay
Michaela B.,2021-06-23,3,To start with the positive the coconut rice cakes were so delicious and unexpected Ive never had anything like them and I would definitely order again The banh xeo was ok It tasted good especially paired with the fresh herbs and dipping sauce But there was a too much jicama and the crepe wasnt quite crispy enough making the dish a bit soft and soggy The bun bo hue was a disappointment The broth was very bland and the tiny pieces of lemongrass made it a pretty unpleasant eating experience It feels like it was made by someone who has never cooked with lemongrass before The vegan bun bo hue at Khoe is wayy better Overall Id give Do Chay another chance Id like to try the banh xeo in house rather than delivery to have it fresh And those coconut rice cakes are worth returning for,Do Chay
Loewe C.,2020-08-31,4,Came here as a non-vegetarian and non-vegan and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food Prices were reasonable and portions were big The food is good  very savoury and does not make you feel like you are missing out by not having any meat We ordered the salted egg yolk eggplant crepe and the satay noodles Crepe was very interesting and big  good to share with 2 people The satay noodles had a very creamy peanut broth and was very hearty The salted egg yolk eggplant sounded very trendy but it tasted more like normal fried eggplant very subtle salted egg yolk flavour All in all I will come again if I ever feel like being healthy and eating more vegetables Full review https://sincerelyloewe.com/do-chay,Do Chay
Sara L.,2021-09-04,5,This is a gem of a restaurant Third time going and excellent as before Tried the coconut rice cakes for thé first time and they were delicious and I like anything Ive ever had before My main dish was eggplant and it was so tender and tasty with a lovely sauce Portions are large here the service is great and friendly I look forward to returning,Do Chay
Glenn K.,2021-08-09,5,Great atmosphere Even better quality I cant say enough about these folks Im not vegan but my friends are and they love the menu I dont miss meaty choices Good times all around,Do Chay
Jessy T.,2021-03-26,5,I dont know why I havent left a review for this place yet This place is the bomb Do Chay is one of my favourite restaurants here in Vancouver Most of the stuff on their menu is vegan friendly and you can find almost anything there that you will want to try My favorites are the bun bo hue vegan pho monsoon spring rolls and the daikon cakes they are a MUST have when you go there I have been trying to move towards a vegan lifestyle and Do Chay makes it easy by having great food items on their menu that dont have to have meat to taste great I always walk out with a happy Buddha belly If youre down to have some delicious vegan food Do Chay is definitely the place to hit up,Do Chay
Chloe C.,2020-02-23,5,Finally ate at Do Chay after leaving due to us having to wait 45 minutes last time and this place definitely did not disappoint I only came with my parents since my brother was tired and he hates vegetables anyway I ended up ordering 10 dishes and the waitress was looking at me like bish are you really sure Well dont underestimate the appetite of a 50 girl because we ended up finishing everything except the jackfruit dish and that was only because we all hated it sorry Do Chay we still love you We ended up packing leftovers  which consisted of half a head of lettuce Yes the people beside us looked at us like we were cuckoo but my mom wanted the lettuce so here we are Green Beans 3.5/5 A very solid dish Its nothing spectacular but the sautéed onions and shallots really elevated this dish The green beans were cooked nicely as well since they werent too undercooked but not limp and soggy either Overall it was a light and refreshing way to start the meal Eat your veggies kids And adults XO Potstickers 4/5 What I liked The crispy bits on top and the XO sauce as well as the mushroom filling What I didnt like The fact that the dumpling skin too thick and that it wasnt pan fried so it didnt have the crispy exterior that I like in potstickers Spring Rolls 5/5 Delicious Spring rolls are always a win and are pretty hard to screw up These ones werent too oily and the filling was flavourful and tasty Salted Egg Yolk Eggplant 2.5/5 Wasnt a fan of the salted egg yolk flavour which didnt go well with the eggplant The batter was too thick and over-fried so it was hard not crispy This issue was especially prominent in the mushrooms which were like mini rocks Coconut Rice Cakes 2/5 These might be good if you like coconut but I wasnt a huge fan of them personally The texture was pretty good except there was some filling on the inside which had the texture of celery This would be rated much higher if I was a coconut fan Pan Fried Daikon Cakes 4.5/5 This was delicious as well The daikon cakes were fried nicely and matched well with the egg underneath and the sauce on top We all devoured it in seconds Okay minutes but whos counting Black Truffle Tofu 4/5 This was quite tasty though my parents enjoyed it a little more than I did probably because I wasnt a fan of the ginger taste from the slivers of ginger on top The truffle and the tofu was good though Jackfruit Lettuce Wraps 0.5/5 The 0.5 is for the lettuce which helped tone down the sauce in the Sweet and Spicy bowl Nothing against this dish but I have now confirmed the fact that I hate jackfruit and so do my parents Banh Xeo Crepe 4.5/5 This was the most surprising thing that I liked It was super tasty The crunch from the crepe and the bean sprouts with the mushrooms and green onions on the inside was a unique tasted that I couldnt get enough of I wish they used a little more mushrooms and a little less bean sprouts but minor complaints Sweet and Spicy Bowl 3/5 The sauce saved this dish The batter on everything in this dish was way too thick which completely ruined the flavour of the vegetables The mushrooms were pretty good though The sauce wasnt spicy at all and its very overpowering making this quite a heavy dish I wouldnt get it again So there were a few misses but Im still giving this place 5 stars because there are enough good items on the menu that I will be coming back for Prices are decent for the portions and service is great as well at least when we came here at 4pm I wish they didnt serve the side vegetables of mint and whatever because no one ended up eating that so it was rather wasteful However we were all very pleased with our experience here and I highly recommend trying this place out,Do Chay
Marc L.,2021-10-22,5,just a lovely place to be and the food is very carefully prepared clean nice patio fun staff,CHAU Veggie Express
Cherry L.,2021-10-29,3,I am a long time customer of CHAU and enjoy their food and drinks Their items are usually always great however I am very disappointed with their execution this time Included is a photo of the coconut shake which I requested for it to be no ice because it was a very cold night This is unacceptable behaviour from a restaurant I know of no other place that under-fills their drinks like this due to a no ice request If this is the case I think they should list the amount of ml on their menu to let the customers know the exact amount they are purchasing Or at least inform the customer at point-of-purchase I am actually already very surprised that I found one piece of coconut meat in this takeout drink because Ive received this drink multiple times without a single piece of coconut meat when I get it to go they usually put two pieces when you order for dine in For a drink that is charged at 6.25 plus taxes I am very disappointed in the amount that was given It is barely half full Overall the taste of food and drinks is great but I am very disappointed in the restaurants execution and inconsistency,CHAU Veggie Express
Thu N.,2021-10-29,4,The menu is diverse with different types of vegetarian dishes compared to other vegetarian restaurants The food is mixture of Vietnamese  Western styles and tastes so good The space is a little small and more suitable for small group gathering  under 5 people,CHAU Veggie Express
Van F.,2021-10-07,5,Today I witnessed a couple of losers harassing the Victoria Street staff for upholding mask/passport policy So unfair You guys are doing a great job keeping yourselves and community safe by following provincially mandated health orders My lunch was delicious,CHAU Veggie Express
Jay K.,2021-09-30,1,they let me come in wait in line for 10 min then once i started ordering takeout told me i cannot order without a vaccine passport i did show my vaccination card and was wearing a mask they couldnt accept my order by phone either because it wasnt working ive been a loyal customer ordering at least weekly for the last two years and im not going back,CHAU Veggie Express
Sydney K.,2021-09-04,5,Just moved to Vancouver and was recommended this place to eat by a friend and it did not disappoint Im vegan myself however I was with my omnivore parents and they were also blown away by how amazing the food was Came here twice and tried different dishes and all of them were astounding Will definitely be my go to place for a meal out,CHAU Veggie Express
Domenic P.,2020-08-29,5,The golden temple soup has healing powers I truly believe it is the best soup Ive had It is named after the famed abode of god a chromed out holy architecture that looks like a wet dream of Salvador Dali who was once quoted saying I dont do drugs I am drugs Which is what this soup is drugs You crave it and it makes you feel better The song Love Is Only A Feeling came on through the speakers after It was placed on my table On this particular day I didnt have plans of coming here but the guy in front of me was turning left and it took me until right now to realize that was no ordinary man that was my spirit guide Woscar that lead me to this soup Please consider offering bibs as my white shirt now has many turmeric stains,CHAU Veggie Express
Marina B.,2020-09-28,5,I absolutely love Chau I cant believe that for years I held off trying it because I was under the false belief that I wouldnt feel fully satisfied with it being vegan I finally tried it one evening with a vegan friend and boy was I wrong The moment the golden temple broth touched my lips I was hooked Ive been coming here regularly ever since Even my meat-loving boyfriend loves it Im so obsessed with the golden-temple soup that I cant not order it every single time My favourite way to have it is with the quinoa which sounds like its going to be too healthy tasting but it just compliments the soup so well The texture of the quinoa is so nice in the soup and it doesnt really absorb the broth too much I also like to get extra veggies between my boyfriend and I we get one order of extra regular veggies broccoli cauliflower carrot and one extra order of yams The extra veggies makes it all the more hearty and I always have leftovers Even though I always get the golden temple Ive tried lots of other things too Everything so far has been delicious Ive tried the diving for pearls soup  which is really tasty the fresh rolls the tempeh one is my absolute favourite the baisou chips must get the coconut shake so yummy must try and the peanut bar you absolutely must get this The ice cream is also really yummy my favourite is the green goodness I dont usually like vegan ice cream but this is so delish Chau is a great place for a quick casual healthy bite for vegans and non-vegans a like The service is always friendly and prompt and the food is always delicious and consistent It also a great place for takeout which is especially important in these times I find in a lot of other restaurants the food either doesnt take out well or you end up getting screwed on the portion size or preparation So Its really nice to find a restaurant where you know you are going to be equally satisfied when choosing takeout and never have to worry about feeling ripped off Im sure Ill be back again next week for my favourite golden temple soup,CHAU Veggie Express
Masaki F.,2021-10-03,2,It was pretty good before but now all potions got smaller and the taste didnt same at all of course the price was higher disappointed but I guess time goes by,CHAU Veggie Express
Patricia F.,2020-09-01,5,I love this place You wont miss meat here My boyfriend is a self professed meat eater and he regularly suggests grabbing dinner from here which is a huge statement Theyve recently knocked down the wall that seperates the spaces and makes the place feel bigger For Covid measures they have stickers on the ground for you to wait to order Plastic barriers have been set up on tables as well For the food I have never had anything not 100% delicious here My favourite is the Golden Temple Bowl which is creamy from coconut milk and packed with flavour The rickety Rick shaw noodle bowl is also very delicious The tarp chips come with an interesting dip At first you may think its a peanut dressing of sorts but once you taste it its very different Definitely recommend this place on any day,CHAU Veggie Express
Glen M.,2020-01-20,5,OMGawda I left this place full as a tick First off its a very popular restaurant along Victoria st 10 minutes after we sat down it was packed Every table filled including counter space so get there early or prepare to wait IF you do have to wait the wait is worth it Cute place All veggie Cant go wrong Well the food  to start we had two different kinds of delicious spring rolls which were very good and these amazing tarot I think thats what they were chips with a dip that was awesome So good And my main meal was the very good Golden Temple something soup that was in a delicious coconut broth with tons of veggies incl a couple veggies Ive never tried before all in a massive bowl Just know youll get fed well and itll be delicious You should try this place,CHAU Veggie Express
Ly W.,2019-12-22,2,Ive tried coming to this restaurant twice and both times it was packed I finally got to try this restaurant today and was excited to see what the hype was about Honestly it wasnt really anything special or spectacular You order at the front and find a seat and food is served to you The servers were great The ladies were so friendly and came by to collect our dishes even though its half self served and asked if everything was okay We didnt find the gentleman at the cashier the owner very friendly No smile or friendly conversation or thank yous when we went up to order Prices are around 11-14 and portion is decent BUT I wasnt full when we left I ordered the Rickety Rickshaw and it is like a normal Vietnamese vermicelli bowl but without meat It had carrots cucumber radish bean sprouts bean curd and four spring roll bites While the ingredients were fresh I found the dish very ordinary The spring rolls were hard like slightly stale and I found the proportion was a little off I was done the spring rolls and was left with a lot of noodles and veggies My bf ordered the Tropical Rainstorm and the coconut was overwhelming If you like coconut then you would like this dish My bf didnt like it because it was on the sweet side and tasted kind of like dessert We also tried the thai milk tea and coconut pandan icecreams We liked how the icecreams werent very sweet but the flavour was light The coconut pandan icecream was quite delightful but I couldnt taste the Thai milk tea flavour for the Thai milk tea icecream Would we come back Probably not If we were craving vegan or vegetarian dishes we prefer the MeeT restaurants because their dishes are flavour bombs,CHAU Veggie Express
Elvi R.,2020-08-16,4,Ive been here multiple times and have ordered pretty much the same thing every time We love the Namaste Fresh Rolls  Nonla Crispy Rolls We order these to start every single time we go For the main I really enjoy the Midnight Swim Bowl with thick rice noodles Its super flavourful ans a little spicy Very delicious We also enjoy the Golden Temple Soup when its a rainy day The Baisao Beach Chips with the tofu dip is great to grab and have as a snack later on,CHAU Veggie Express
Sayoka H.,2020-10-08,4,Been a big supporter of CHAU Veggie since their open Never once have I had a terrible experience and the food is delicious My got to is their golden temple soup with a side bowl of rice My goodness bowl of hot soup on a crispy cold Vancouver day is heaven in my mouth Portions are on the bigger side but hey you get your moneys worth Their Taro chips are delicious I would kill to have the sauce at home with veggie snacks as well I am not a vegetarian but have grown a lot of love for this place Definitely support your local business as much as possible this one is my pick,CHAU Veggie Express
Max L.,2021-05-07,5,Love Golden Temple soup with quinoa and Namahata rolls Always fresh and great customer service Highly recommended,CHAU Veggie Express
Colene C.,2019-12-18,5,This place makes healthy eating easy Whether its their yummy tarp chips and addicting dip or their noodle bowls I always feel so satiated when Im eating here Even better its made with fresh ingredients so I dont have to feel guilty My go-to favourites are the taro chips the rickety rickshaw bowl and the golden temple soup The golden temple soup in particular has this rich curry broth that is great for the veggies to soak up the flavour You have a choice of rice or noodles but my fave is the noodles The only slight downside is how popular this place is You order first at the counter then find a place to sit Communal and bar seating But I love the food here so much its worth it Pro-tip they have a location on Granville Island Great to get take out and sit by the water,CHAU Veggie Express
Cherise B.,2021-04-04,5,This was our first visit and it wont be our last Oh my goodness the food is delicious and so fresh We had the Golden Temple Soup  everything everyone says in the reviews is true Its just perfect Im so happy we ordered two so I have left overs for tomorrow We also loved the Namaste rolls Nonla Crispy rolls and the Chocolate Peanut butter bar  WOW Were so excited to try more dishes and also get all of these items again And to top it off the customer service is amazing Highly recommend,CHAU Veggie Express
Michelle W.,2019-05-24,4,Ive been trying to cut down on my meat intake lately so it was about time to CHAU down on some veggies I was a bit confused walking in as I didnt know that you had to pay first and seat yourself Water and condiments are also self-serve While I do prefer paying after my main issue was in regard to the tables as they werent wiped down after customers left Our table fell victim to this as it had a sticky residue and some crumbs As I wasnt too hungry I only ordered a Namaste Fresh Roll 5.50 and had a bit of the Golden Temple Soup 14.25 The Namaste Fresh Roll was pho-nomenal Having recently had one across the stress this roll knocked the other out of the water Absent of meat this rolls flavour is fully embodied in the lemongrass steamed tofu mung beans crispy shallots and wheat centre and roasted peanut sauce among other ingredients I certainly have to highlight this sauce because it was thiccc and had actual peanuts in it Of course I smothered my roll in it down to the last drop In other words order this dish For the meager amount of the Golden Temple Soup that I tried it packed quite the punch The aroma of the turmeric coconut curry was intoxicating and only surpassed by its rich complex flavour This and the Rice Fields Bowl appear to be the largest in portion size and are the most expensive but neither dish seems like it will leave you feeling too bloated While I enjoyed the rice noodles and the beancurd I didnt care much for the taro which was too large and dense for my liking It was the only point in the meal where I missed the succulent bite of meat say a beef brisket It was my first time eating at this location and I fully intend on sampling more of the menu to write a more fulsome review When I went to the Granville Island location I had the Rickety Rickshaw and it was pretty good from what I remember though Id imagine the portion size is smaller than this locations Next up for me will be the Rice Fields Bowl and the Namahata Fresh Rolls Until then CHAU for now,CHAU Veggie Express
Sunny T.,2020-10-18,5,Staff were friendly and all covid measures were in place The coconut drink really blew me away,CHAU Veggie Express
Sandra W.,2020-09-05,5,Wonderfully surprised I wish I could eat here everyday I love their nutritious green smoothies and yummy menu after a long day of hiking and tennis Was beautifully plated and safe measures were taken and luckily wasnt too busy We sat outside on the patio and the service was great,CHAU Veggie Express
Mateo D.,2020-07-07,5,Amazing service by Shefali Jess and Jaycobe Thanks guys and also great options Had a happy face and it was delicious Also shefali prepared me a Matcha latte also really good Thank you,Buddha-Full
Nicole B.,2021-01-01,3,Went to the North van location yesterday and feasted on some Vegan veg and drinks The bohemian bowl was okay fresh carrots beets lentils and brown rice with a decent warm sauce It didnt knock my socks off The green juice was tasty and comes in a nice sized glass bottle They have juice shots I ordered the fireball and gagged because it tasted like salad dressing so I took it home and poured it on my salad My daughter ordered the happy face smoothie and said it was delicious The avocado toast was okay but even the spicy was bland,Buddha-Full
Paula F.,2019-08-14,4,Wonderful little vegan vegetarian eatery next to the Quay My daughter and I are visiting Vancouver from California and just had a lite lunch here It was our first stop We throughly enjoyed it This eatery is environmentally conscious and minimalistic in waste Compostable to go containers are used for to go items and regular washable plates bowls and utensils are used for dining in There was one communal table and a few smaller tables inside and a small patio area outside in front The menu filled with yummy plant-based options adorned the wall as you walk in Choices included smoothies Acai bowls wraps Buddha bowls salads toasts sides shots teas and kombuchas A huge selection of pastries on display behind glass were also available They also had a menu option for dogs We chose the Berry Bliss Acai Bowl and the Bohemian Soul Bowl The Acai bowl came out in a reasonable amount of time The Buddha bowl took a little longer Both presented well with plenty of bright colors and tasted great Prices were a little high but well worth the price The ingredients were fresh healthy and locally grown and/or brought in Service was friendly and helpful We have a few more days in Vancouver We will definitely visit Buddha-full again before we leave,Buddha-Full
Josephine W.,2020-03-08,4,I dropped in to Buddhafull during the Hot Chocolate Festival as I was curious about their mushroom hot chocolate The shop is inviting and cute with lots of greenery and wood accents The drink I had was called Ancient Wisdom a raw dark hot chocolate with adaptogenic healing mushrooms and a light spice The rim had some sweet spices that was delicious I love dark hot chocolate and I could taste the mushrooms It worked quite well I would come back to try some of their other dishes Lots of healthy items on their menu,Buddha-Full
Meredith D.,2021-03-01,4,Have been in here a couple times and hadnt reviewed Recently grabbed take out from here with a couple immunity boosting drinks and ramen bowl Ill admit that vegan/vegetarian doesnt usually excite me but it hit the spot and definitely something we will shortlist going forward,Buddha-Full
Jessica W.,2019-11-28,4,Popped in as I was walking the neighborhood and looking for a healthy option A great storefront selling lots of local items so I loved looking around and finding some new local artisans Went to order and the person working the till seemed very friendly but during the lunch hour rush with a long line they were chatting long periods with each customer as I was about 4th in line when I went to order and many more coming in during my wait I get friendlyness but during the rush period on a weekday was a little frustrated Then it took over 15 minutes for the avo toast I ordered so I finally had to ask for it to go as I was due back for work and no longer had time to stay and eat The avo toast itself was wonderful  really great mix not just slabbing avocado on some bread so it was worth the long wait in the end and will go back in the future for sure just making sure I get myself a little extra time And the fact it came in a heart well that was overly adorable Also they had some amazing vegan desserts wish I picked one up,Buddha-Full
Brittany F.,2019-11-04,2,Ive been a loyal customer of Buddha-Full for years Back in the day it was somewhat of a cult following for yogis and health junkies but has recently become popular among the broader Vancouver crowd Im usually sucked into their Lobo smoothie and mint Nanaimo bar which are inconsistent in quality but good for the most part Today I decided to venture outside of the norm and have to say it was regrettable I got the pumpkin smoothie which is fine tastes like blended pumpkin pie and is overwhelmingly spiced with nutmeg The mistake was the raspberry cheesecake which was so stale I was pretty dissatisfied so I brought it back to the counter and the employee seemed annoyed by my complaint I asked to exchange it for a different dessert that was actually a lower price than what I paid but she said I had to get the same cheesecake I reluctantly agreed This second slice was even more rock hard than the first see picture I took one bite and left the rest Theres so many great healthy cafes and smoothie spots in Van now I dont see the point in coming back to here with that type of oversight and customer service Might have to leave you as a memory Bye-da-full wave-emoji,Buddha-Full
Nina S.,2019-05-31,3,I enjoyed everything here and feel great after eating clean but the prices are very high for the portions Value 2/5 Atmosphere 4/5 Service 3/5 Quality 4/5 13/20,Buddha-Full
Joyce L.,2019-08-23,5,I happened upon this cafe while I was in search for Two Daughters whose storefront appeared to be closed There was a sign on the fence indicating they were still accepting special orders so they were definitely still open for business I ran into some ladies who were looking to get pastries at the same shop and they let me know that Buddha-full also sold their goods and walked me there The decor of Buddha-full was super cute I didnt have a chance to Yelp this place prior to going so I wasnt studied up on this cafe I was happy to learn this place was fully vegan and there were just so many sweets and pastries to choose from Since this was a healthier place it appeared most of the sweets were sweetened with dates and natural sweeteners vs straight-up sugar The girl at the register was very helpful in recommending things to try I got the Mango Cheesecake Bar Sunflower Seed Bar and Golden Milk I think thats what it was called Everything was so good I also appreciated not having to pay extra for non-dairy milk Yay The sweets had just a hint of sweetness so they werent overpowering or exhausting Since they were made of whole food ingredients I found them to be quite filling and it took me quite a bit of picking at them throughout the day to finally finish them I wasnt even able to finish them after a hard run at Grouse Grind they were very filling I definitely will come back here the next time Im in Vancouver,Buddha-Full
Del A.,2018-05-19,3,My friends and I decided to visit this spot because we were in the North Van area and had seen pictures of the interior of this place Although we expected it to be more expensive than most places we were shocked to find out that all of their smoothies were 11 While they have a lot of options to choose from and the portion sizes are pretty large I still felt that it was a lot to shell out for a smoothie Regardless I ordered the Green Guru smoothie with cold-pressed apple juice + mango + spinach + pineapple + dates and thought it was good but nothing spectacular The staff is all lovely and friendly as well which is always a plus My favourite part of this café would have to be the interior  its one of the most aesthetic cafes that Ive been to and they even have adorable swings definitely instaworthy That being said I recommend coming once if you want a cute spot to have a smoothie and take shameless pics for the Insta but I probably wouldnt come back a second time given the steep prices,Buddha-Full
Michelle S.,2019-08-30,3,I want to give 3.5 star I ordered rainbow salad and I got a pre-made salad from the fridge It wasnt amazing but decent Wish they made the salad like they did with the bowl my friend ordered Will I come back Maybe,Buddha-Full
Mikayla S.,2020-07-25,1,Really dont get the hype with this place its not that the food is bad but its fine Its nothing to write home about Most importantly they take SO LONG I was just talking to a friend about this place and she stopped going here because they take so long The procedures set in place for COVID are also not up to par the arrows on the floor are for how to exit and they dont enforce social distancing I ordered two simple smoothies from here about 40 minutes ahead of time When I got there they still werent made I literally got them 30 minutes later Thats simply ridiculous Theyre smoothies Ive worked in the restaurant industry for years this is not how they should function,Buddha-Full
Kaitlyn P.,2019-03-17,4,Lovely vegan spot in North Vancouver right in Lower Lonsdale within walking distance to the Quay Great variety on their menu offering juvies lattes smoothies Avis bowls wraps soups salads Buddha bowls and baked goods I had the Ohana Luv Acia bowl and it was good but I noticed all their bowls have the same toppings which is disappointing because they all tasty different but look the same It would be nice if they put in some effort and were slightly different Also I wasnt impressed with the fact that they say bowls will be topped with seasonal fruit yet all I saw on mine was 2 slices of green apple and banana for that reason they get knocked down a star,Buddha-Full
Kate M.,2019-11-05,2,Love the decor and concept but yikes the day I tried this joint for the first time they werent properly staffed and the pricing is too much for what youre getting The woman at the till was clearly in training as she didnt know the product or what she was doing on the till but no one seemed to be taking the time to actually help her out The line up was building behind me quickly and then someone more experience hopped on to show this woman where things were on the iPad and what she needed to do I just asked what teas they had and the more experienced woman wanted this girl in training to take down all the teas from the shelf and let me smell them Although thats nice to do when youve got the time and dont have a pile of people waiting So as she starts taking them down off the shelf I let her know she doesnt need to do that and Ill just have an earl grey and a samosa The samosa was nothing special Ive had a much better veggie samosa elsewhere Indian oven for much cheaper For a plain earl grey tea and a samosa I paid 10 The tea cup was only filled halfway with water too no milk to honey no nothing to make it a little more special than a plain black tea I wouldnt go back here if Im being honest as it left me feeling really underwhelmed,Buddha-Full
Lara O.,2017-05-03,5,I have no complaints Space is beautiful love the communal tables Service was friendly and at a very reasonable pace for how busy it was  Food was delicious and presented so gorgeously I adore their commitment to local suppliers which they list for you to see It is a bit more expensive here but what do people expect for local organic food I for one am happy to support local businesses that support local suppliers and a commitment to organic vegan food My Buddha bowl left me happy and full I couldnt finish it all Hubs had the avo toast and it looked incredible he also said he didnt need anything more,Buddha-Full
Emily D.,2018-01-21,1,This is my first visit Very sad first impression/experience here I placed a pick up order online and paid extra to have a side soup and avocado and tofu in my sandwich I came in to pickup my order very excited to try a new place where I can eat with all my food allergies My order was ready on time and the service was friendly Restaurant has a nice layout and design ascetic I was given my order but had to ask for a takeaway bag odd since it was a  to go order I didnt look inside my take away box because I assumed my order was correct I trusted them When I got home I sat down to open/have my meal and saw a salad Well that was a waste of 3 I decided Id suck that up I went to have the sandwich and then realized the tofu and avocado that I also paid extra for was not included I was SO disappointed I also realized the bread was not gluten free Normally I dont like to complain or write 1 star reviews but after walking in the rain spending 28.88 for a sandwich and latte and feeling a little cheated I decided to call and see if they could remake my order When I called I spoke to the woman who took my name and looked up my order She obviously apologized and said I could have a free pastry next time Im in Thats when I asked about the bread because I was told by a friend who goes here often this was a gluten free restaurant When ordering on their site I saw gluten free vegan organic advertised and assumed it was safe to order Picture attached from website showing misleading info Her reply to me was that people who have gluten issues usually spend more time asking questions and viewing websites I completely understand that was my mistake but what a thing to say when THEIR kitchen staff clearly doesnt read an online take out order That statement really disappointed me and surprised me Since a free pastry wasnt what I wanted I am allergic I asked if they could remake my order Her reply was that the kitchen was closed and there was nothing they could do She asked for my phone number even though it would be on my online order and said the manager would call me tomorrow Since I cannot eat my dinner wasted 28.88 wasted my time and they wont remake my order...what I had WISHED they offered was a refund for the sandwich soup avocado and tofu My latte Im fine to pay for because it was correct and it was yummy Sadly this was not offered to me or mentioned In fact when I asked for this I was told the manager would call I would love to have a good experience here I understand mistakes are made we are only human and restaurants close at 7 PM/people have lives I expect a call from the manager tomorrow and hope I will receive my refund I will update this review with the outcome Really hope I receive a call tomorrow UPDATE never received a follow up,Buddha-Full
Sangeetha M.,2018-02-14,3,Tbh I went to take pictures on the swing The decor is really nice and who doesnt like to sit on swings There are many options for smoothies and it is very overpriced I didnt try the food It took quite some time for the smoothie to be made Overall Id go back to take some nice pictures but wouldnt for the smoothies,Buddha-Full
Thayssa S.,2019-06-11,5,Very healthy food and tasty I love their açai bowl Not done they way Im used to eat but definitely a go when Im home sick,Buddha-Full
Simon W.,2017-05-08,2,The place has got an eat-pray-love vibe to it I ordered their seasonal Buddha bowl for take-out which Im told is an Ahi Poke To my dismay I couldnt find a single trace of Ahi being Japanese for yellowfin tuna in my bowl I dug through the whole thing but was already back at the office so no chance to bring this up with the powers that be Rest of the flavouring was quite nice the highlight being the roasted yams which tasted like roasted yams Im not up to speed on the other trendy ingredients but I do know what tuna looks like when I see it  which I didnt They have an extensive misc home good selection of books candles olive oil and general gifts for the vancouver special They sell Tiffin carriers which Id totally use if I had lunch packed for me everyday  stainless steel just doesnt microwave that well but not to say I wasnt tempted Id just really like some Ahi in my Ahi Poke Is that too much to ask Probably a 4 star if its included I understand that its a vegan place but lets respect the meaning behind words and use them appropriately  Ahi means tuna,Buddha-Full
Jess S.,2017-03-05,5,Yup I love this place Its not huge maybe it is but its soooo busy but you can sit inside or outside Service is extremely excellent considering the amount of people that come and the turn around From the person taking our order to the one making it and they one clearing the dishes every single person was smiling and helpful We ordered the Heart Beet smoothie cold-pressed beet juice + raspberries + strawberries + pineapple pakoras and the GF The Fiesta wrap frijoles de olla + daiya cheese + avocado + tomato + cabbage + chilies Everything is super delicious and incredibly healthy The location is perfect a few blocks from the sea bus and Londsdale Quay We ended up leaving super full and picking up deserts vegan and GF for our brew tour I got the blueberry scone which was hot and moist AF I cant believe its GF Note they do run out of food We were there at 3 and the salad and wrap I wanted were sold out So get there early,Buddha-Full
