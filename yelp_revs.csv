Nicole B.,2021-01-01,3,Went to the North van location yesterday and feasted on some Vegan veg and drinks The bohemian bowl was okay fresh carrots beets lentils and brown rice with a decent warm sauce It didnt knock my socks off The green juice was tasty and comes in a nice sized glass bottle They have juice shots I ordered the fireball and gagged because it tasted like salad dressing so I took it home and poured it on my salad My daughter ordered the happy face smoothie and said it was delicious The avocado toast was okay but even the spicy was bland,MILA Plant-Based
Paula F.,2019-08-14,4,Wonderful little vegan vegetarian eatery next to the Quay My daughter and I are visiting Vancouver from California and just had a lite lunch here It was our first stop We throughly enjoyed it This eatery is environmentally conscious and minimalistic in waste Compostable to go containers are used for to go items and regular washable plates bowls and utensils are used for dining in There was one communal table and a few smaller tables inside and a small patio area outside in front The menu filled with yummy plant-based options adorned the wall as you walk in Choices included smoothies Acai bowls wraps Buddha bowls salads toasts sides shots teas and kombuchas A huge selection of pastries on display behind glass were also available They also had a menu option for dogs We chose the Berry Bliss Acai Bowl and the Bohemian Soul Bowl The Acai bowl came out in a reasonable amount of time The Buddha bowl took a little longer Both presented well with plenty of bright colors and tasted great Prices were a little high but well worth the price The ingredients were fresh healthy and locally grown and/or brought in Service was friendly and helpful We have a few more days in Vancouver We will definitely visit Buddha-full again before we leave,MILA Plant-Based
Josephine W.,2020-03-08,4,I dropped in to Buddhafull during the Hot Chocolate Festival as I was curious about their mushroom hot chocolate The shop is inviting and cute with lots of greenery and wood accents The drink I had was called Ancient Wisdom a raw dark hot chocolate with adaptogenic healing mushrooms and a light spice The rim had some sweet spices that was delicious I love dark hot chocolate and I could taste the mushrooms It worked quite well I would come back to try some of their other dishes Lots of healthy items on their menu,MILA Plant-Based
Meredith D.,2021-03-01,4,Have been in here a couple times and hadnt reviewed Recently grabbed take out from here with a couple immunity boosting drinks and ramen bowl Ill admit that vegan/vegetarian doesnt usually excite me but it hit the spot and definitely something we will shortlist going forward,MILA Plant-Based
Jessica W.,2019-11-28,4,Popped in as I was walking the neighborhood and looking for a healthy option A great storefront selling lots of local items so I loved looking around and finding some new local artisans Went to order and the person working the till seemed very friendly but during the lunch hour rush with a long line they were chatting long periods with each customer as I was about 4th in line when I went to order and many more coming in during my wait I get friendlyness but during the rush period on a weekday was a little frustrated Then it took over 15 minutes for the avo toast I ordered so I finally had to ask for it to go as I was due back for work and no longer had time to stay and eat The avo toast itself was wonderful  really great mix not just slabbing avocado on some bread so it was worth the long wait in the end and will go back in the future for sure just making sure I get myself a little extra time And the fact it came in a heart well that was overly adorable Also they had some amazing vegan desserts wish I picked one up,MILA Plant-Based
Brittany F.,2019-11-04,2,Ive been a loyal customer of Buddha-Full for years Back in the day it was somewhat of a cult following for yogis and health junkies but has recently become popular among the broader Vancouver crowd Im usually sucked into their Lobo smoothie and mint Nanaimo bar which are inconsistent in quality but good for the most part Today I decided to venture outside of the norm and have to say it was regrettable I got the pumpkin smoothie which is fine tastes like blended pumpkin pie and is overwhelmingly spiced with nutmeg The mistake was the raspberry cheesecake which was so stale I was pretty dissatisfied so I brought it back to the counter and the employee seemed annoyed by my complaint I asked to exchange it for a different dessert that was actually a lower price than what I paid but she said I had to get the same cheesecake I reluctantly agreed This second slice was even more rock hard than the first see picture I took one bite and left the rest Theres so many great healthy cafes and smoothie spots in Van now I dont see the point in coming back to here with that type of oversight and customer service Might have to leave you as a memory Bye-da-full wave-emoji,MILA Plant-Based
Nina S.,2019-05-31,3,I enjoyed everything here and feel great after eating clean but the prices are very high for the portions Value 2/5 Atmosphere 4/5 Service 3/5 Quality 4/5 13/20,MILA Plant-Based
Joyce L.,2019-08-23,5,I happened upon this cafe while I was in search for Two Daughters whose storefront appeared to be closed There was a sign on the fence indicating they were still accepting special orders so they were definitely still open for business I ran into some ladies who were looking to get pastries at the same shop and they let me know that Buddha-full also sold their goods and walked me there The decor of Buddha-full was super cute I didnt have a chance to Yelp this place prior to going so I wasnt studied up on this cafe I was happy to learn this place was fully vegan and there were just so many sweets and pastries to choose from Since this was a healthier place it appeared most of the sweets were sweetened with dates and natural sweeteners vs straight-up sugar The girl at the register was very helpful in recommending things to try I got the Mango Cheesecake Bar Sunflower Seed Bar and Golden Milk I think thats what it was called Everything was so good I also appreciated not having to pay extra for non-dairy milk Yay The sweets had just a hint of sweetness so they werent overpowering or exhausting Since they were made of whole food ingredients I found them to be quite filling and it took me quite a bit of picking at them throughout the day to finally finish them I wasnt even able to finish them after a hard run at Grouse Grind they were very filling I definitely will come back here the next time Im in Vancouver,MILA Plant-Based
Del A.,2018-05-19,3,My friends and I decided to visit this spot because we were in the North Van area and had seen pictures of the interior of this place Although we expected it to be more expensive than most places we were shocked to find out that all of their smoothies were 11 While they have a lot of options to choose from and the portion sizes are pretty large I still felt that it was a lot to shell out for a smoothie Regardless I ordered the Green Guru smoothie with cold-pressed apple juice + mango + spinach + pineapple + dates and thought it was good but nothing spectacular The staff is all lovely and friendly as well which is always a plus My favourite part of this café would have to be the interior  its one of the most aesthetic cafes that Ive been to and they even have adorable swings definitely instaworthy That being said I recommend coming once if you want a cute spot to have a smoothie and take shameless pics for the Insta but I probably wouldnt come back a second time given the steep prices,MILA Plant-Based
Michelle S.,2019-08-30,3,I want to give 3.5 star I ordered rainbow salad and I got a pre-made salad from the fridge It wasnt amazing but decent Wish they made the salad like they did with the bowl my friend ordered Will I come back Maybe,MILA Plant-Based
Mikayla S.,2020-07-25,1,Really dont get the hype with this place its not that the food is bad but its fine Its nothing to write home about Most importantly they take SO LONG I was just talking to a friend about this place and she stopped going here because they take so long The procedures set in place for COVID are also not up to par the arrows on the floor are for how to exit and they dont enforce social distancing I ordered two simple smoothies from here about 40 minutes ahead of time When I got there they still werent made I literally got them 30 minutes later Thats simply ridiculous Theyre smoothies Ive worked in the restaurant industry for years this is not how they should function,MILA Plant-Based
Kaitlyn P.,2019-03-17,4,Lovely vegan spot in North Vancouver right in Lower Lonsdale within walking distance to the Quay Great variety on their menu offering juvies lattes smoothies Avis bowls wraps soups salads Buddha bowls and baked goods I had the Ohana Luv Acia bowl and it was good but I noticed all their bowls have the same toppings which is disappointing because they all tasty different but look the same It would be nice if they put in some effort and were slightly different Also I wasnt impressed with the fact that they say bowls will be topped with seasonal fruit yet all I saw on mine was 2 slices of green apple and banana for that reason they get knocked down a star,MILA Plant-Based
Kate M.,2019-11-05,2,Love the decor and concept but yikes the day I tried this joint for the first time they werent properly staffed and the pricing is too much for what youre getting The woman at the till was clearly in training as she didnt know the product or what she was doing on the till but no one seemed to be taking the time to actually help her out The line up was building behind me quickly and then someone more experience hopped on to show this woman where things were on the iPad and what she needed to do I just asked what teas they had and the more experienced woman wanted this girl in training to take down all the teas from the shelf and let me smell them Although thats nice to do when youve got the time and dont have a pile of people waiting So as she starts taking them down off the shelf I let her know she doesnt need to do that and Ill just have an earl grey and a samosa The samosa was nothing special Ive had a much better veggie samosa elsewhere Indian oven for much cheaper For a plain earl grey tea and a samosa I paid 10 The tea cup was only filled halfway with water too no milk to honey no nothing to make it a little more special than a plain black tea I wouldnt go back here if Im being honest as it left me feeling really underwhelmed,MILA Plant-Based
Lara O.,2017-05-03,5,I have no complaints Space is beautiful love the communal tables Service was friendly and at a very reasonable pace for how busy it was  Food was delicious and presented so gorgeously I adore their commitment to local suppliers which they list for you to see It is a bit more expensive here but what do people expect for local organic food I for one am happy to support local businesses that support local suppliers and a commitment to organic vegan food My Buddha bowl left me happy and full I couldnt finish it all Hubs had the avo toast and it looked incredible he also said he didnt need anything more,MILA Plant-Based
Emily D.,2018-01-21,1,This is my first visit Very sad first impression/experience here I placed a pick up order online and paid extra to have a side soup and avocado and tofu in my sandwich I came in to pickup my order very excited to try a new place where I can eat with all my food allergies My order was ready on time and the service was friendly Restaurant has a nice layout and design ascetic I was given my order but had to ask for a takeaway bag odd since it was a  to go order I didnt look inside my take away box because I assumed my order was correct I trusted them When I got home I sat down to open/have my meal and saw a salad Well that was a waste of 3 I decided Id suck that up I went to have the sandwich and then realized the tofu and avocado that I also paid extra for was not included I was SO disappointed I also realized the bread was not gluten free Normally I dont like to complain or write 1 star reviews but after walking in the rain spending 28.88 for a sandwich and latte and feeling a little cheated I decided to call and see if they could remake my order When I called I spoke to the woman who took my name and looked up my order She obviously apologized and said I could have a free pastry next time Im in Thats when I asked about the bread because I was told by a friend who goes here often this was a gluten free restaurant When ordering on their site I saw gluten free vegan organic advertised and assumed it was safe to order Picture attached from website showing misleading info Her reply to me was that people who have gluten issues usually spend more time asking questions and viewing websites I completely understand that was my mistake but what a thing to say when THEIR kitchen staff clearly doesnt read an online take out order That statement really disappointed me and surprised me Since a free pastry wasnt what I wanted I am allergic I asked if they could remake my order Her reply was that the kitchen was closed and there was nothing they could do She asked for my phone number even though it would be on my online order and said the manager would call me tomorrow Since I cannot eat my dinner wasted 28.88 wasted my time and they wont remake my order...what I had WISHED they offered was a refund for the sandwich soup avocado and tofu My latte Im fine to pay for because it was correct and it was yummy Sadly this was not offered to me or mentioned In fact when I asked for this I was told the manager would call I would love to have a good experience here I understand mistakes are made we are only human and restaurants close at 7 PM/people have lives I expect a call from the manager tomorrow and hope I will receive my refund I will update this review with the outcome Really hope I receive a call tomorrow UPDATE never received a follow up,MILA Plant-Based
Sangeetha M.,2018-02-14,3,Tbh I went to take pictures on the swing The decor is really nice and who doesnt like to sit on swings There are many options for smoothies and it is very overpriced I didnt try the food It took quite some time for the smoothie to be made Overall Id go back to take some nice pictures but wouldnt for the smoothies,MILA Plant-Based
Thayssa S.,2019-06-11,5,Very healthy food and tasty I love their açai bowl Not done they way Im used to eat but definitely a go when Im home sick,MILA Plant-Based
Simon W.,2017-05-08,2,The place has got an eat-pray-love vibe to it I ordered their seasonal Buddha bowl for take-out which Im told is an Ahi Poke To my dismay I couldnt find a single trace of Ahi being Japanese for yellowfin tuna in my bowl I dug through the whole thing but was already back at the office so no chance to bring this up with the powers that be Rest of the flavouring was quite nice the highlight being the roasted yams which tasted like roasted yams Im not up to speed on the other trendy ingredients but I do know what tuna looks like when I see it  which I didnt They have an extensive misc home good selection of books candles olive oil and general gifts for the vancouver special They sell Tiffin carriers which Id totally use if I had lunch packed for me everyday  stainless steel just doesnt microwave that well but not to say I wasnt tempted Id just really like some Ahi in my Ahi Poke Is that too much to ask Probably a 4 star if its included I understand that its a vegan place but lets respect the meaning behind words and use them appropriately  Ahi means tuna,MILA Plant-Based
Jess S.,2017-03-05,5,Yup I love this place Its not huge maybe it is but its soooo busy but you can sit inside or outside Service is extremely excellent considering the amount of people that come and the turn around From the person taking our order to the one making it and they one clearing the dishes every single person was smiling and helpful We ordered the Heart Beet smoothie cold-pressed beet juice + raspberries + strawberries + pineapple pakoras and the GF The Fiesta wrap frijoles de olla + daiya cheese + avocado + tomato + cabbage + chilies Everything is super delicious and incredibly healthy The location is perfect a few blocks from the sea bus and Londsdale Quay We ended up leaving super full and picking up deserts vegan and GF for our brew tour I got the blueberry scone which was hot and moist AF I cant believe its GF Note they do run out of food We were there at 3 and the salad and wrap I wanted were sold out So get there early,MILA Plant-Based

Jessica W.,2019-11-28,4,Popped in as I was walking the neighborhood and looking for a healthy option A great storefront selling lots of local items so I loved looking around and finding some new local artisans Went to order and the person working the till seemed very friendly but during the lunch hour rush with a long line they were chatting long periods with each customer as I was about 4th in line when I went to order and many more coming in during my wait I get friendlyness but during the rush period on a weekday was a little frustrated Then it took over 15 minutes for the avo toast I ordered so I finally had to ask for it to go as I was due back for work and no longer had time to stay and eat The avo toast itself was wonderful  really great mix not just slabbing avocado on some bread so it was worth the long wait in the end and will go back in the future for sure just making sure I get myself a little extra time And the fact it came in a heart well that was overly adorable Also they had some amazing vegan desserts wish I picked one up,MeeT in Gastown
Brittany F.,2019-11-04,2,Ive been a loyal customer of Buddha-Full for years Back in the day it was somewhat of a cult following for yogis and health junkies but has recently become popular among the broader Vancouver crowd Im usually sucked into their Lobo smoothie and mint Nanaimo bar which are inconsistent in quality but good for the most part Today I decided to venture outside of the norm and have to say it was regrettable I got the pumpkin smoothie which is fine tastes like blended pumpkin pie and is overwhelmingly spiced with nutmeg The mistake was the raspberry cheesecake which was so stale I was pretty dissatisfied so I brought it back to the counter and the employee seemed annoyed by my complaint I asked to exchange it for a different dessert that was actually a lower price than what I paid but she said I had to get the same cheesecake I reluctantly agreed This second slice was even more rock hard than the first see picture I took one bite and left the rest Theres so many great healthy cafes and smoothie spots in Van now I dont see the point in coming back to here with that type of oversight and customer service Might have to leave you as a memory Bye-da-full wave-emoji,MeeT in Gastown
Nina S.,2019-05-31,3,I enjoyed everything here and feel great after eating clean but the prices are very high for the portions Value 2/5 Atmosphere 4/5 Service 3/5 Quality 4/5 13/20,MeeT in Gastown
Joyce L.,2019-08-23,5,I happened upon this cafe while I was in search for Two Daughters whose storefront appeared to be closed There was a sign on the fence indicating they were still accepting special orders so they were definitely still open for business I ran into some ladies who were looking to get pastries at the same shop and they let me know that Buddha-full also sold their goods and walked me there The decor of Buddha-full was super cute I didnt have a chance to Yelp this place prior to going so I wasnt studied up on this cafe I was happy to learn this place was fully vegan and there were just so many sweets and pastries to choose from Since this was a healthier place it appeared most of the sweets were sweetened with dates and natural sweeteners vs straight-up sugar The girl at the register was very helpful in recommending things to try I got the Mango Cheesecake Bar Sunflower Seed Bar and Golden Milk I think thats what it was called Everything was so good I also appreciated not having to pay extra for non-dairy milk Yay The sweets had just a hint of sweetness so they werent overpowering or exhausting Since they were made of whole food ingredients I found them to be quite filling and it took me quite a bit of picking at them throughout the day to finally finish them I wasnt even able to finish them after a hard run at Grouse Grind they were very filling I definitely will come back here the next time Im in Vancouver,MeeT in Gastown
Del A.,2018-05-19,3,My friends and I decided to visit this spot because we were in the North Van area and had seen pictures of the interior of this place Although we expected it to be more expensive than most places we were shocked to find out that all of their smoothies were 11 While they have a lot of options to choose from and the portion sizes are pretty large I still felt that it was a lot to shell out for a smoothie Regardless I ordered the Green Guru smoothie with cold-pressed apple juice + mango + spinach + pineapple + dates and thought it was good but nothing spectacular The staff is all lovely and friendly as well which is always a plus My favourite part of this café would have to be the interior  its one of the most aesthetic cafes that Ive been to and they even have adorable swings definitely instaworthy That being said I recommend coming once if you want a cute spot to have a smoothie and take shameless pics for the Insta but I probably wouldnt come back a second time given the steep prices,MeeT in Gastown
Michelle S.,2019-08-30,3,I want to give 3.5 star I ordered rainbow salad and I got a pre-made salad from the fridge It wasnt amazing but decent Wish they made the salad like they did with the bowl my friend ordered Will I come back Maybe,MeeT in Gastown
Mikayla S.,2020-07-25,1,Really dont get the hype with this place its not that the food is bad but its fine Its nothing to write home about Most importantly they take SO LONG I was just talking to a friend about this place and she stopped going here because they take so long The procedures set in place for COVID are also not up to par the arrows on the floor are for how to exit and they dont enforce social distancing I ordered two simple smoothies from here about 40 minutes ahead of time When I got there they still werent made I literally got them 30 minutes later Thats simply ridiculous Theyre smoothies Ive worked in the restaurant industry for years this is not how they should function,MeeT in Gastown
Kaitlyn P.,2019-03-17,4,Lovely vegan spot in North Vancouver right in Lower Lonsdale within walking distance to the Quay Great variety on their menu offering juvies lattes smoothies Avis bowls wraps soups salads Buddha bowls and baked goods I had the Ohana Luv Acia bowl and it was good but I noticed all their bowls have the same toppings which is disappointing because they all tasty different but look the same It would be nice if they put in some effort and were slightly different Also I wasnt impressed with the fact that they say bowls will be topped with seasonal fruit yet all I saw on mine was 2 slices of green apple and banana for that reason they get knocked down a star,MeeT in Gastown
Kate M.,2019-11-05,2,Love the decor and concept but yikes the day I tried this joint for the first time they werent properly staffed and the pricing is too much for what youre getting The woman at the till was clearly in training as she didnt know the product or what she was doing on the till but no one seemed to be taking the time to actually help her out The line up was building behind me quickly and then someone more experience hopped on to show this woman where things were on the iPad and what she needed to do I just asked what teas they had and the more experienced woman wanted this girl in training to take down all the teas from the shelf and let me smell them Although thats nice to do when youve got the time and dont have a pile of people waiting So as she starts taking them down off the shelf I let her know she doesnt need to do that and Ill just have an earl grey and a samosa The samosa was nothing special Ive had a much better veggie samosa elsewhere Indian oven for much cheaper For a plain earl grey tea and a samosa I paid 10 The tea cup was only filled halfway with water too no milk to honey no nothing to make it a little more special than a plain black tea I wouldnt go back here if Im being honest as it left me feeling really underwhelmed,MeeT in Gastown
Lara O.,2017-05-03,5,I have no complaints Space is beautiful love the communal tables Service was friendly and at a very reasonable pace for how busy it was  Food was delicious and presented so gorgeously I adore their commitment to local suppliers which they list for you to see It is a bit more expensive here but what do people expect for local organic food I for one am happy to support local businesses that support local suppliers and a commitment to organic vegan food My Buddha bowl left me happy and full I couldnt finish it all Hubs had the avo toast and it looked incredible he also said he didnt need anything more,MeeT in Gastown
Emily D.,2018-01-21,1,This is my first visit Very sad first impression/experience here I placed a pick up order online and paid extra to have a side soup and avocado and tofu in my sandwich I came in to pickup my order very excited to try a new place where I can eat with all my food allergies My order was ready on time and the service was friendly Restaurant has a nice layout and design ascetic I was given my order but had to ask for a takeaway bag odd since it was a  to go order I didnt look inside my take away box because I assumed my order was correct I trusted them When I got home I sat down to open/have my meal and saw a salad Well that was a waste of 3 I decided Id suck that up I went to have the sandwich and then realized the tofu and avocado that I also paid extra for was not included I was SO disappointed I also realized the bread was not gluten free Normally I dont like to complain or write 1 star reviews but after walking in the rain spending 28.88 for a sandwich and latte and feeling a little cheated I decided to call and see if they could remake my order When I called I spoke to the woman who took my name and looked up my order She obviously apologized and said I could have a free pastry next time Im in Thats when I asked about the bread because I was told by a friend who goes here often this was a gluten free restaurant When ordering on their site I saw gluten free vegan organic advertised and assumed it was safe to order Picture attached from website showing misleading info Her reply to me was that people who have gluten issues usually spend more time asking questions and viewing websites I completely understand that was my mistake but what a thing to say when THEIR kitchen staff clearly doesnt read an online take out order That statement really disappointed me and surprised me Since a free pastry wasnt what I wanted I am allergic I asked if they could remake my order Her reply was that the kitchen was closed and there was nothing they could do She asked for my phone number even though it would be on my online order and said the manager would call me tomorrow Since I cannot eat my dinner wasted 28.88 wasted my time and they wont remake my order...what I had WISHED they offered was a refund for the sandwich soup avocado and tofu My latte Im fine to pay for because it was correct and it was yummy Sadly this was not offered to me or mentioned In fact when I asked for this I was told the manager would call I would love to have a good experience here I understand mistakes are made we are only human and restaurants close at 7 PM/people have lives I expect a call from the manager tomorrow and hope I will receive my refund I will update this review with the outcome Really hope I receive a call tomorrow UPDATE never received a follow up,MeeT in Gastown
Sangeetha M.,2018-02-14,3,Tbh I went to take pictures on the swing The decor is really nice and who doesnt like to sit on swings There are many options for smoothies and it is very overpriced I didnt try the food It took quite some time for the smoothie to be made Overall Id go back to take some nice pictures but wouldnt for the smoothies,MeeT in Gastown
Thayssa S.,2019-06-11,5,Very healthy food and tasty I love their açai bowl Not done they way Im used to eat but definitely a go when Im home sick,MeeT in Gastown
Simon W.,2017-05-08,2,The place has got an eat-pray-love vibe to it I ordered their seasonal Buddha bowl for take-out which Im told is an Ahi Poke To my dismay I couldnt find a single trace of Ahi being Japanese for yellowfin tuna in my bowl I dug through the whole thing but was already back at the office so no chance to bring this up with the powers that be Rest of the flavouring was quite nice the highlight being the roasted yams which tasted like roasted yams Im not up to speed on the other trendy ingredients but I do know what tuna looks like when I see it  which I didnt They have an extensive misc home good selection of books candles olive oil and general gifts for the vancouver special They sell Tiffin carriers which Id totally use if I had lunch packed for me everyday  stainless steel just doesnt microwave that well but not to say I wasnt tempted Id just really like some Ahi in my Ahi Poke Is that too much to ask Probably a 4 star if its included I understand that its a vegan place but lets respect the meaning behind words and use them appropriately  Ahi means tuna,MeeT in Gastown
Jess S.,2017-03-05,5,Yup I love this place Its not huge maybe it is but its soooo busy but you can sit inside or outside Service is extremely excellent considering the amount of people that come and the turn around From the person taking our order to the one making it and they one clearing the dishes every single person was smiling and helpful We ordered the Heart Beet smoothie cold-pressed beet juice + raspberries + strawberries + pineapple pakoras and the GF The Fiesta wrap frijoles de olla + daiya cheese + avocado + tomato + cabbage + chilies Everything is super delicious and incredibly healthy The location is perfect a few blocks from the sea bus and Londsdale Quay We ended up leaving super full and picking up deserts vegan and GF for our brew tour I got the blueberry scone which was hot and moist AF I cant believe its GF Note they do run out of food We were there at 3 and the salad and wrap I wanted were sold out So get there early,MeeT in Gastown

Nicole B.,2021-01-01,3,Went to the North van location yesterday and feasted on some Vegan veg and drinks The bohemian bowl was okay fresh carrots beets lentils and brown rice with a decent warm sauce It didnt knock my socks off The green juice was tasty and comes in a nice sized glass bottle They have juice shots I ordered the fireball and gagged because it tasted like salad dressing so I took it home and poured it on my salad My daughter ordered the happy face smoothie and said it was delicious The avocado toast was okay but even the spicy was bland,BeetBox
Paula F.,2019-08-14,4,Wonderful little vegan vegetarian eatery next to the Quay My daughter and I are visiting Vancouver from California and just had a lite lunch here It was our first stop We throughly enjoyed it This eatery is environmentally conscious and minimalistic in waste Compostable to go containers are used for to go items and regular washable plates bowls and utensils are used for dining in There was one communal table and a few smaller tables inside and a small patio area outside in front The menu filled with yummy plant-based options adorned the wall as you walk in Choices included smoothies Acai bowls wraps Buddha bowls salads toasts sides shots teas and kombuchas A huge selection of pastries on display behind glass were also available They also had a menu option for dogs We chose the Berry Bliss Acai Bowl and the Bohemian Soul Bowl The Acai bowl came out in a reasonable amount of time The Buddha bowl took a little longer Both presented well with plenty of bright colors and tasted great Prices were a little high but well worth the price The ingredients were fresh healthy and locally grown and/or brought in Service was friendly and helpful We have a few more days in Vancouver We will definitely visit Buddha-full again before we leave,BeetBox

Joyce L.,2019-08-23,5,I happened upon this cafe while I was in search for Two Daughters whose storefront appeared to be closed There was a sign on the fence indicating they were still accepting special orders so they were definitely still open for business I ran into some ladies who were looking to get pastries at the same shop and they let me know that Buddha-full also sold their goods and walked me there The decor of Buddha-full was super cute I didnt have a chance to Yelp this place prior to going so I wasnt studied up on this cafe I was happy to learn this place was fully vegan and there were just so many sweets and pastries to choose from Since this was a healthier place it appeared most of the sweets were sweetened with dates and natural sweeteners vs straight-up sugar The girl at the register was very helpful in recommending things to try I got the Mango Cheesecake Bar Sunflower Seed Bar and Golden Milk I think thats what it was called Everything was so good I also appreciated not having to pay extra for non-dairy milk Yay The sweets had just a hint of sweetness so they werent overpowering or exhausting Since they were made of whole food ingredients I found them to be quite filling and it took me quite a bit of picking at them throughout the day to finally finish them I wasnt even able to finish them after a hard run at Grouse Grind they were very filling I definitely will come back here the next time Im in Vancouver,Vegan Cave Cafe
Del A.,2018-05-19,3,My friends and I decided to visit this spot because we were in the North Van area and had seen pictures of the interior of this place Although we expected it to be more expensive than most places we were shocked to find out that all of their smoothies were 11 While they have a lot of options to choose from and the portion sizes are pretty large I still felt that it was a lot to shell out for a smoothie Regardless I ordered the Green Guru smoothie with cold-pressed apple juice + mango + spinach + pineapple + dates and thought it was good but nothing spectacular The staff is all lovely and friendly as well which is always a plus My favourite part of this café would have to be the interior  its one of the most aesthetic cafes that Ive been to and they even have adorable swings definitely instaworthy That being said I recommend coming once if you want a cute spot to have a smoothie and take shameless pics for the Insta but I probably wouldnt come back a second time given the steep prices,Vegan Cave Cafe
Michelle S.,2019-08-30,3,I want to give 3.5 star I ordered rainbow salad and I got a pre-made salad from the fridge It wasnt amazing but decent Wish they made the salad like they did with the bowl my friend ordered Will I come back Maybe,Vegan Cave Cafe
Mikayla S.,2020-07-25,1,Really dont get the hype with this place its not that the food is bad but its fine Its nothing to write home about Most importantly they take SO LONG I was just talking to a friend about this place and she stopped going here because they take so long The procedures set in place for COVID are also not up to par the arrows on the floor are for how to exit and they dont enforce social distancing I ordered two simple smoothies from here about 40 minutes ahead of time When I got there they still werent made I literally got them 30 minutes later Thats simply ridiculous Theyre smoothies Ive worked in the restaurant industry for years this is not how they should function,Vegan Cave Cafe
Kaitlyn P.,2019-03-17,4,Lovely vegan spot in North Vancouver right in Lower Lonsdale within walking distance to the Quay Great variety on their menu offering juvies lattes smoothies Avis bowls wraps soups salads Buddha bowls and baked goods I had the Ohana Luv Acia bowl and it was good but I noticed all their bowls have the same toppings which is disappointing because they all tasty different but look the same It would be nice if they put in some effort and were slightly different Also I wasnt impressed with the fact that they say bowls will be topped with seasonal fruit yet all I saw on mine was 2 slices of green apple and banana for that reason they get knocked down a star,Vegan Cave Cafe
Kate M.,2019-11-05,2,Love the decor and concept but yikes the day I tried this joint for the first time they werent properly staffed and the pricing is too much for what youre getting The woman at the till was clearly in training as she didnt know the product or what she was doing on the till but no one seemed to be taking the time to actually help her out The line up was building behind me quickly and then someone more experience hopped on to show this woman where things were on the iPad and what she needed to do I just asked what teas they had and the more experienced woman wanted this girl in training to take down all the teas from the shelf and let me smell them Although thats nice to do when youve got the time and dont have a pile of people waiting So as she starts taking them down off the shelf I let her know she doesnt need to do that and Ill just have an earl grey and a samosa The samosa was nothing special Ive had a much better veggie samosa elsewhere Indian oven for much cheaper For a plain earl grey tea and a samosa I paid 10 The tea cup was only filled halfway with water too no milk to honey no nothing to make it a little more special than a plain black tea I wouldnt go back here if Im being honest as it left me feeling really underwhelmed,Vegan Cave Cafe
Lara O.,2017-05-03,5,I have no complaints Space is beautiful love the communal tables Service was friendly and at a very reasonable pace for how busy it was  Food was delicious and presented so gorgeously I adore their commitment to local suppliers which they list for you to see It is a bit more expensive here but what do people expect for local organic food I for one am happy to support local businesses that support local suppliers and a commitment to organic vegan food My Buddha bowl left me happy and full I couldnt finish it all Hubs had the avo toast and it looked incredible he also said he didnt need anything more,Vegan Cave Cafe
Emily D.,2018-01-21,1,This is my first visit Very sad first impression/experience here I placed a pick up order online and paid extra to have a side soup and avocado and tofu in my sandwich I came in to pickup my order very excited to try a new place where I can eat with all my food allergies My order was ready on time and the service was friendly Restaurant has a nice layout and design ascetic I was given my order but had to ask for a takeaway bag odd since it was a  to go order I didnt look inside my take away box because I assumed my order was correct I trusted them When I got home I sat down to open/have my meal and saw a salad Well that was a waste of 3 I decided Id suck that up I went to have the sandwich and then realized the tofu and avocado that I also paid extra for was not included I was SO disappointed I also realized the bread was not gluten free Normally I dont like to complain or write 1 star reviews but after walking in the rain spending 28.88 for a sandwich and latte and feeling a little cheated I decided to call and see if they could remake my order When I called I spoke to the woman who took my name and looked up my order She obviously apologized and said I could have a free pastry next time Im in Thats when I asked about the bread because I was told by a friend who goes here often this was a gluten free restaurant When ordering on their site I saw gluten free vegan organic advertised and assumed it was safe to order Picture attached from website showing misleading info Her reply to me was that people who have gluten issues usually spend more time asking questions and viewing websites I completely understand that was my mistake but what a thing to say when THEIR kitchen staff clearly doesnt read an online take out order That statement really disappointed me and surprised me Since a free pastry wasnt what I wanted I am allergic I asked if they could remake my order Her reply was that the kitchen was closed and there was nothing they could do She asked for my phone number even though it would be on my online order and said the manager would call me tomorrow Since I cannot eat my dinner wasted 28.88 wasted my time and they wont remake my order...what I had WISHED they offered was a refund for the sandwich soup avocado and tofu My latte Im fine to pay for because it was correct and it was yummy Sadly this was not offered to me or mentioned In fact when I asked for this I was told the manager would call I would love to have a good experience here I understand mistakes are made we are only human and restaurants close at 7 PM/people have lives I expect a call from the manager tomorrow and hope I will receive my refund I will update this review with the outcome Really hope I receive a call tomorrow UPDATE never received a follow up,Vegan Cave Cafe
Sangeetha M.,2018-02-14,3,Tbh I went to take pictures on the swing The decor is really nice and who doesnt like to sit on swings There are many options for smoothies and it is very overpriced I didnt try the food It took quite some time for the smoothie to be made Overall Id go back to take some nice pictures but wouldnt for the smoothies,Vegan Cave Cafe
Thayssa S.,2019-06-11,5,Very healthy food and tasty I love their açai bowl Not done they way Im used to eat but definitely a go when Im home sick,Vegan Cave Cafe
Simon W.,2017-05-08,2,The place has got an eat-pray-love vibe to it I ordered their seasonal Buddha bowl for take-out which Im told is an Ahi Poke To my dismay I couldnt find a single trace of Ahi being Japanese for yellowfin tuna in my bowl I dug through the whole thing but was already back at the office so no chance to bring this up with the powers that be Rest of the flavouring was quite nice the highlight being the roasted yams which tasted like roasted yams Im not up to speed on the other trendy ingredients but I do know what tuna looks like when I see it  which I didnt They have an extensive misc home good selection of books candles olive oil and general gifts for the vancouver special They sell Tiffin carriers which Id totally use if I had lunch packed for me everyday  stainless steel just doesnt microwave that well but not to say I wasnt tempted Id just really like some Ahi in my Ahi Poke Is that too much to ask Probably a 4 star if its included I understand that its a vegan place but lets respect the meaning behind words and use them appropriately  Ahi means tuna,Vegan Cave Cafe
Jess S.,2017-03-05,5,Yup I love this place Its not huge maybe it is but its soooo busy but you can sit inside or outside Service is extremely excellent considering the amount of people that come and the turn around From the person taking our order to the one making it and they one clearing the dishes every single person was smiling and helpful We ordered the Heart Beet smoothie cold-pressed beet juice + raspberries + strawberries + pineapple pakoras and the GF The Fiesta wrap frijoles de olla + daiya cheese + avocado + tomato + cabbage + chilies Everything is super delicious and incredibly healthy The location is perfect a few blocks from the sea bus and Londsdale Quay We ended up leaving super full and picking up deserts vegan and GF for our brew tour I got the blueberry scone which was hot and moist AF I cant believe its GF Note they do run out of food We were there at 3 and the salad and wrap I wanted were sold out So get there early,Vegan Cave Cafe

Nicole B.,2021-01-01,3,Went to the North van location yesterday and feasted on some Vegan veg and drinks The bohemian bowl was okay fresh carrots beets lentils and brown rice with a decent warm sauce It didnt knock my socks off The green juice was tasty and comes in a nice sized glass bottle They have juice shots I ordered the fireball and gagged because it tasted like salad dressing so I took it home and poured it on my salad My daughter ordered the happy face smoothie and said it was delicious The avocado toast was okay but even the spicy was bland,Nuba in Gastown
Paula F.,2019-08-14,4,Wonderful little vegan vegetarian eatery next to the Quay My daughter and I are visiting Vancouver from California and just had a lite lunch here It was our first stop We throughly enjoyed it This eatery is environmentally conscious and minimalistic in waste Compostable to go containers are used for to go items and regular washable plates bowls and utensils are used for dining in There was one communal table and a few smaller tables inside and a small patio area outside in front The menu filled with yummy plant-based options adorned the wall as you walk in Choices included smoothies Acai bowls wraps Buddha bowls salads toasts sides shots teas and kombuchas A huge selection of pastries on display behind glass were also available They also had a menu option for dogs We chose the Berry Bliss Acai Bowl and the Bohemian Soul Bowl The Acai bowl came out in a reasonable amount of time The Buddha bowl took a little longer Both presented well with plenty of bright colors and tasted great Prices were a little high but well worth the price The ingredients were fresh healthy and locally grown and/or brought in Service was friendly and helpful We have a few more days in Vancouver We will definitely visit Buddha-full again before we leave,Nuba in Gastown
Josephine W.,2020-03-08,4,I dropped in to Buddhafull during the Hot Chocolate Festival as I was curious about their mushroom hot chocolate The shop is inviting and cute with lots of greenery and wood accents The drink I had was called Ancient Wisdom a raw dark hot chocolate with adaptogenic healing mushrooms and a light spice The rim had some sweet spices that was delicious I love dark hot chocolate and I could taste the mushrooms It worked quite well I would come back to try some of their other dishes Lots of healthy items on their menu,Nuba in Gastown
Meredith D.,2021-03-01,4,Have been in here a couple times and hadnt reviewed Recently grabbed take out from here with a couple immunity boosting drinks and ramen bowl Ill admit that vegan/vegetarian doesnt usually excite me but it hit the spot and definitely something we will shortlist going forward,Nuba in Gastown
Jessica W.,2019-11-28,4,Popped in as I was walking the neighborhood and looking for a healthy option A great storefront selling lots of local items so I loved looking around and finding some new local artisans Went to order and the person working the till seemed very friendly but during the lunch hour rush with a long line they were chatting long periods with each customer as I was about 4th in line when I went to order and many more coming in during my wait I get friendlyness but during the rush period on a weekday was a little frustrated Then it took over 15 minutes for the avo toast I ordered so I finally had to ask for it to go as I was due back for work and no longer had time to stay and eat The avo toast itself was wonderful  really great mix not just slabbing avocado on some bread so it was worth the long wait in the end and will go back in the future for sure just making sure I get myself a little extra time And the fact it came in a heart well that was overly adorable Also they had some amazing vegan desserts wish I picked one up,Nuba in Gastown

Del A.,2018-05-19,3,My friends and I decided to visit this spot because we were in the North Van area and had seen pictures of the interior of this place Although we expected it to be more expensive than most places we were shocked to find out that all of their smoothies were 11 While they have a lot of options to choose from and the portion sizes are pretty large I still felt that it was a lot to shell out for a smoothie Regardless I ordered the Green Guru smoothie with cold-pressed apple juice + mango + spinach + pineapple + dates and thought it was good but nothing spectacular The staff is all lovely and friendly as well which is always a plus My favourite part of this café would have to be the interior  its one of the most aesthetic cafes that Ive been to and they even have adorable swings definitely instaworthy That being said I recommend coming once if you want a cute spot to have a smoothie and take shameless pics for the Insta but I probably wouldnt come back a second time given the steep prices,Do Chay
Michelle S.,2019-08-30,3,I want to give 3.5 star I ordered rainbow salad and I got a pre-made salad from the fridge It wasnt amazing but decent Wish they made the salad like they did with the bowl my friend ordered Will I come back Maybe,Do Chay
Mikayla S.,2020-07-25,1,Really dont get the hype with this place its not that the food is bad but its fine Its nothing to write home about Most importantly they take SO LONG I was just talking to a friend about this place and she stopped going here because they take so long The procedures set in place for COVID are also not up to par the arrows on the floor are for how to exit and they dont enforce social distancing I ordered two simple smoothies from here about 40 minutes ahead of time When I got there they still werent made I literally got them 30 minutes later Thats simply ridiculous Theyre smoothies Ive worked in the restaurant industry for years this is not how they should function,Do Chay
Kaitlyn P.,2019-03-17,4,Lovely vegan spot in North Vancouver right in Lower Lonsdale within walking distance to the Quay Great variety on their menu offering juvies lattes smoothies Avis bowls wraps soups salads Buddha bowls and baked goods I had the Ohana Luv Acia bowl and it was good but I noticed all their bowls have the same toppings which is disappointing because they all tasty different but look the same It would be nice if they put in some effort and were slightly different Also I wasnt impressed with the fact that they say bowls will be topped with seasonal fruit yet all I saw on mine was 2 slices of green apple and banana for that reason they get knocked down a star,Do Chay
Kate M.,2019-11-05,2,Love the decor and concept but yikes the day I tried this joint for the first time they werent properly staffed and the pricing is too much for what youre getting The woman at the till was clearly in training as she didnt know the product or what she was doing on the till but no one seemed to be taking the time to actually help her out The line up was building behind me quickly and then someone more experience hopped on to show this woman where things were on the iPad and what she needed to do I just asked what teas they had and the more experienced woman wanted this girl in training to take down all the teas from the shelf and let me smell them Although thats nice to do when youve got the time and dont have a pile of people waiting So as she starts taking them down off the shelf I let her know she doesnt need to do that and Ill just have an earl grey and a samosa The samosa was nothing special Ive had a much better veggie samosa elsewhere Indian oven for much cheaper For a plain earl grey tea and a samosa I paid 10 The tea cup was only filled halfway with water too no milk to honey no nothing to make it a little more special than a plain black tea I wouldnt go back here if Im being honest as it left me feeling really underwhelmed,Do Chay
Lara O.,2017-05-03,5,I have no complaints Space is beautiful love the communal tables Service was friendly and at a very reasonable pace for how busy it was  Food was delicious and presented so gorgeously I adore their commitment to local suppliers which they list for you to see It is a bit more expensive here but what do people expect for local organic food I for one am happy to support local businesses that support local suppliers and a commitment to organic vegan food My Buddha bowl left me happy and full I couldnt finish it all Hubs had the avo toast and it looked incredible he also said he didnt need anything more,Do Chay
Emily D.,2018-01-21,1,This is my first visit Very sad first impression/experience here I placed a pick up order online and paid extra to have a side soup and avocado and tofu in my sandwich I came in to pickup my order very excited to try a new place where I can eat with all my food allergies My order was ready on time and the service was friendly Restaurant has a nice layout and design ascetic I was given my order but had to ask for a takeaway bag odd since it was a  to go order I didnt look inside my take away box because I assumed my order was correct I trusted them When I got home I sat down to open/have my meal and saw a salad Well that was a waste of 3 I decided Id suck that up I went to have the sandwich and then realized the tofu and avocado that I also paid extra for was not included I was SO disappointed I also realized the bread was not gluten free Normally I dont like to complain or write 1 star reviews but after walking in the rain spending 28.88 for a sandwich and latte and feeling a little cheated I decided to call and see if they could remake my order When I called I spoke to the woman who took my name and looked up my order She obviously apologized and said I could have a free pastry next time Im in Thats when I asked about the bread because I was told by a friend who goes here often this was a gluten free restaurant When ordering on their site I saw gluten free vegan organic advertised and assumed it was safe to order Picture attached from website showing misleading info Her reply to me was that people who have gluten issues usually spend more time asking questions and viewing websites I completely understand that was my mistake but what a thing to say when THEIR kitchen staff clearly doesnt read an online take out order That statement really disappointed me and surprised me Since a free pastry wasnt what I wanted I am allergic I asked if they could remake my order Her reply was that the kitchen was closed and there was nothing they could do She asked for my phone number even though it would be on my online order and said the manager would call me tomorrow Since I cannot eat my dinner wasted 28.88 wasted my time and they wont remake my order...what I had WISHED they offered was a refund for the sandwich soup avocado and tofu My latte Im fine to pay for because it was correct and it was yummy Sadly this was not offered to me or mentioned In fact when I asked for this I was told the manager would call I would love to have a good experience here I understand mistakes are made we are only human and restaurants close at 7 PM/people have lives I expect a call from the manager tomorrow and hope I will receive my refund I will update this review with the outcome Really hope I receive a call tomorrow UPDATE never received a follow up,Do Chay
Sangeetha M.,2018-02-14,3,Tbh I went to take pictures on the swing The decor is really nice and who doesnt like to sit on swings There are many options for smoothies and it is very overpriced I didnt try the food It took quite some time for the smoothie to be made Overall Id go back to take some nice pictures but wouldnt for the smoothies,Do Chay
Thayssa S.,2019-06-11,5,Very healthy food and tasty I love their açai bowl Not done they way Im used to eat but definitely a go when Im home sick,Do Chay
Simon W.,2017-05-08,2,The place has got an eat-pray-love vibe to it I ordered their seasonal Buddha bowl for take-out which Im told is an Ahi Poke To my dismay I couldnt find a single trace of Ahi being Japanese for yellowfin tuna in my bowl I dug through the whole thing but was already back at the office so no chance to bring this up with the powers that be Rest of the flavouring was quite nice the highlight being the roasted yams which tasted like roasted yams Im not up to speed on the other trendy ingredients but I do know what tuna looks like when I see it  which I didnt They have an extensive misc home good selection of books candles olive oil and general gifts for the vancouver special They sell Tiffin carriers which Id totally use if I had lunch packed for me everyday  stainless steel just doesnt microwave that well but not to say I wasnt tempted Id just really like some Ahi in my Ahi Poke Is that too much to ask Probably a 4 star if its included I understand that its a vegan place but lets respect the meaning behind words and use them appropriately  Ahi means tuna,Do Chay
Jess S.,2017-03-05,5,Yup I love this place Its not huge maybe it is but its soooo busy but you can sit inside or outside Service is extremely excellent considering the amount of people that come and the turn around From the person taking our order to the one making it and they one clearing the dishes every single person was smiling and helpful We ordered the Heart Beet smoothie cold-pressed beet juice + raspberries + strawberries + pineapple pakoras and the GF The Fiesta wrap frijoles de olla + daiya cheese + avocado + tomato + cabbage + chilies Everything is super delicious and incredibly healthy The location is perfect a few blocks from the sea bus and Londsdale Quay We ended up leaving super full and picking up deserts vegan and GF for our brew tour I got the blueberry scone which was hot and moist AF I cant believe its GF Note they do run out of food We were there at 3 and the salad and wrap I wanted were sold out So get there early,Do Chay

Nicole B.,2021-01-01,3,Went to the North van location yesterday and feasted on some Vegan veg and drinks The bohemian bowl was okay fresh carrots beets lentils and brown rice with a decent warm sauce It didnt knock my socks off The green juice was tasty and comes in a nice sized glass bottle They have juice shots I ordered the fireball and gagged because it tasted like salad dressing so I took it home and poured it on my salad My daughter ordered the happy face smoothie and said it was delicious The avocado toast was okay but even the spicy was bland,CHAU Veggie Express
Paula F.,2019-08-14,4,Wonderful little vegan vegetarian eatery next to the Quay My daughter and I are visiting Vancouver from California and just had a lite lunch here It was our first stop We throughly enjoyed it This eatery is environmentally conscious and minimalistic in waste Compostable to go containers are used for to go items and regular washable plates bowls and utensils are used for dining in There was one communal table and a few smaller tables inside and a small patio area outside in front The menu filled with yummy plant-based options adorned the wall as you walk in Choices included smoothies Acai bowls wraps Buddha bowls salads toasts sides shots teas and kombuchas A huge selection of pastries on display behind glass were also available They also had a menu option for dogs We chose the Berry Bliss Acai Bowl and the Bohemian Soul Bowl The Acai bowl came out in a reasonable amount of time The Buddha bowl took a little longer Both presented well with plenty of bright colors and tasted great Prices were a little high but well worth the price The ingredients were fresh healthy and locally grown and/or brought in Service was friendly and helpful We have a few more days in Vancouver We will definitely visit Buddha-full again before we leave,CHAU Veggie Express
Josephine W.,2020-03-08,4,I dropped in to Buddhafull during the Hot Chocolate Festival as I was curious about their mushroom hot chocolate The shop is inviting and cute with lots of greenery and wood accents The drink I had was called Ancient Wisdom a raw dark hot chocolate with adaptogenic healing mushrooms and a light spice The rim had some sweet spices that was delicious I love dark hot chocolate and I could taste the mushrooms It worked quite well I would come back to try some of their other dishes Lots of healthy items on their menu,CHAU Veggie Express
Meredith D.,2021-03-01,4,Have been in here a couple times and hadnt reviewed Recently grabbed take out from here with a couple immunity boosting drinks and ramen bowl Ill admit that vegan/vegetarian doesnt usually excite me but it hit the spot and definitely something we will shortlist going forward,CHAU Veggie Express
Jessica W.,2019-11-28,4,Popped in as I was walking the neighborhood and looking for a healthy option A great storefront selling lots of local items so I loved looking around and finding some new local artisans Went to order and the person working the till seemed very friendly but during the lunch hour rush with a long line they were chatting long periods with each customer as I was about 4th in line when I went to order and many more coming in during my wait I get friendlyness but during the rush period on a weekday was a little frustrated Then it took over 15 minutes for the avo toast I ordered so I finally had to ask for it to go as I was due back for work and no longer had time to stay and eat The avo toast itself was wonderful  really great mix not just slabbing avocado on some bread so it was worth the long wait in the end and will go back in the future for sure just making sure I get myself a little extra time And the fact it came in a heart well that was overly adorable Also they had some amazing vegan desserts wish I picked one up,CHAU Veggie Express
Brittany F.,2019-11-04,2,Ive been a loyal customer of Buddha-Full for years Back in the day it was somewhat of a cult following for yogis and health junkies but has recently become popular among the broader Vancouver crowd Im usually sucked into their Lobo smoothie and mint Nanaimo bar which are inconsistent in quality but good for the most part Today I decided to venture outside of the norm and have to say it was regrettable I got the pumpkin smoothie which is fine tastes like blended pumpkin pie and is overwhelmingly spiced with nutmeg The mistake was the raspberry cheesecake which was so stale I was pretty dissatisfied so I brought it back to the counter and the employee seemed annoyed by my complaint I asked to exchange it for a different dessert that was actually a lower price than what I paid but she said I had to get the same cheesecake I reluctantly agreed This second slice was even more rock hard than the first see picture I took one bite and left the rest Theres so many great healthy cafes and smoothie spots in Van now I dont see the point in coming back to here with that type of oversight and customer service Might have to leave you as a memory Bye-da-full wave-emoji,CHAU Veggie Express

Kaitlyn P.,2019-03-17,4,Lovely vegan spot in North Vancouver right in Lower Lonsdale within walking distance to the Quay Great variety on their menu offering juvies lattes smoothies Avis bowls wraps soups salads Buddha bowls and baked goods I had the Ohana Luv Acia bowl and it was good but I noticed all their bowls have the same toppings which is disappointing because they all tasty different but look the same It would be nice if they put in some effort and were slightly different Also I wasnt impressed with the fact that they say bowls will be topped with seasonal fruit yet all I saw on mine was 2 slices of green apple and banana for that reason they get knocked down a star,Buddha-Full
Kate M.,2019-11-05,2,Love the decor and concept but yikes the day I tried this joint for the first time they werent properly staffed and the pricing is too much for what youre getting The woman at the till was clearly in training as she didnt know the product or what she was doing on the till but no one seemed to be taking the time to actually help her out The line up was building behind me quickly and then someone more experience hopped on to show this woman where things were on the iPad and what she needed to do I just asked what teas they had and the more experienced woman wanted this girl in training to take down all the teas from the shelf and let me smell them Although thats nice to do when youve got the time and dont have a pile of people waiting So as she starts taking them down off the shelf I let her know she doesnt need to do that and Ill just have an earl grey and a samosa The samosa was nothing special Ive had a much better veggie samosa elsewhere Indian oven for much cheaper For a plain earl grey tea and a samosa I paid 10 The tea cup was only filled halfway with water too no milk to honey no nothing to make it a little more special than a plain black tea I wouldnt go back here if Im being honest as it left me feeling really underwhelmed,Buddha-Full
Lara O.,2017-05-03,5,I have no complaints Space is beautiful love the communal tables Service was friendly and at a very reasonable pace for how busy it was  Food was delicious and presented so gorgeously I adore their commitment to local suppliers which they list for you to see It is a bit more expensive here but what do people expect for local organic food I for one am happy to support local businesses that support local suppliers and a commitment to organic vegan food My Buddha bowl left me happy and full I couldnt finish it all Hubs had the avo toast and it looked incredible he also said he didnt need anything more,Buddha-Full
Emily D.,2018-01-21,1,This is my first visit Very sad first impression/experience here I placed a pick up order online and paid extra to have a side soup and avocado and tofu in my sandwich I came in to pickup my order very excited to try a new place where I can eat with all my food allergies My order was ready on time and the service was friendly Restaurant has a nice layout and design ascetic I was given my order but had to ask for a takeaway bag odd since it was a  to go order I didnt look inside my take away box because I assumed my order was correct I trusted them When I got home I sat down to open/have my meal and saw a salad Well that was a waste of 3 I decided Id suck that up I went to have the sandwich and then realized the tofu and avocado that I also paid extra for was not included I was SO disappointed I also realized the bread was not gluten free Normally I dont like to complain or write 1 star reviews but after walking in the rain spending 28.88 for a sandwich and latte and feeling a little cheated I decided to call and see if they could remake my order When I called I spoke to the woman who took my name and looked up my order She obviously apologized and said I could have a free pastry next time Im in Thats when I asked about the bread because I was told by a friend who goes here often this was a gluten free restaurant When ordering on their site I saw gluten free vegan organic advertised and assumed it was safe to order Picture attached from website showing misleading info Her reply to me was that people who have gluten issues usually spend more time asking questions and viewing websites I completely understand that was my mistake but what a thing to say when THEIR kitchen staff clearly doesnt read an online take out order That statement really disappointed me and surprised me Since a free pastry wasnt what I wanted I am allergic I asked if they could remake my order Her reply was that the kitchen was closed and there was nothing they could do She asked for my phone number even though it would be on my online order and said the manager would call me tomorrow Since I cannot eat my dinner wasted 28.88 wasted my time and they wont remake my order...what I had WISHED they offered was a refund for the sandwich soup avocado and tofu My latte Im fine to pay for because it was correct and it was yummy Sadly this was not offered to me or mentioned In fact when I asked for this I was told the manager would call I would love to have a good experience here I understand mistakes are made we are only human and restaurants close at 7 PM/people have lives I expect a call from the manager tomorrow and hope I will receive my refund I will update this review with the outcome Really hope I receive a call tomorrow UPDATE never received a follow up,Buddha-Full
Sangeetha M.,2018-02-14,3,Tbh I went to take pictures on the swing The decor is really nice and who doesnt like to sit on swings There are many options for smoothies and it is very overpriced I didnt try the food It took quite some time for the smoothie to be made Overall Id go back to take some nice pictures but wouldnt for the smoothies,Buddha-Full
Thayssa S.,2019-06-11,5,Very healthy food and tasty I love their açai bowl Not done they way Im used to eat but definitely a go when Im home sick,Buddha-Full
Simon W.,2017-05-08,2,The place has got an eat-pray-love vibe to it I ordered their seasonal Buddha bowl for take-out which Im told is an Ahi Poke To my dismay I couldnt find a single trace of Ahi being Japanese for yellowfin tuna in my bowl I dug through the whole thing but was already back at the office so no chance to bring this up with the powers that be Rest of the flavouring was quite nice the highlight being the roasted yams which tasted like roasted yams Im not up to speed on the other trendy ingredients but I do know what tuna looks like when I see it  which I didnt They have an extensive misc home good selection of books candles olive oil and general gifts for the vancouver special They sell Tiffin carriers which Id totally use if I had lunch packed for me everyday  stainless steel just doesnt microwave that well but not to say I wasnt tempted Id just really like some Ahi in my Ahi Poke Is that too much to ask Probably a 4 star if its included I understand that its a vegan place but lets respect the meaning behind words and use them appropriately  Ahi means tuna,Buddha-Full
Jess S.,2017-03-05,5,Yup I love this place Its not huge maybe it is but its soooo busy but you can sit inside or outside Service is extremely excellent considering the amount of people that come and the turn around From the person taking our order to the one making it and they one clearing the dishes every single person was smiling and helpful We ordered the Heart Beet smoothie cold-pressed beet juice + raspberries + strawberries + pineapple pakoras and the GF The Fiesta wrap frijoles de olla + daiya cheese + avocado + tomato + cabbage + chilies Everything is super delicious and incredibly healthy The location is perfect a few blocks from the sea bus and Londsdale Quay We ended up leaving super full and picking up deserts vegan and GF for our brew tour I got the blueberry scone which was hot and moist AF I cant believe its GF Note they do run out of food We were there at 3 and the salad and wrap I wanted were sold out So get there early,Buddha-Full
Mateo D.,2020-07-07,5,Amazing service by Shefali Jess and Jaycobe Thanks guys and also great options Had a happy face and it was delicious Also shefali prepared me a Matcha latte also really good Thank you,Tama Organic Life
Nicole B.,2021-01-01,3,Went to the North van location yesterday and feasted on some Vegan veg and drinks The bohemian bowl was okay fresh carrots beets lentils and brown rice with a decent warm sauce It didnt knock my socks off The green juice was tasty and comes in a nice sized glass bottle They have juice shots I ordered the fireball and gagged because it tasted like salad dressing so I took it home and poured it on my salad My daughter ordered the happy face smoothie and said it was delicious The avocado toast was okay but even the spicy was bland,Tama Organic Life
Paula F.,2019-08-14,4,Wonderful little vegan vegetarian eatery next to the Quay My daughter and I are visiting Vancouver from California and just had a lite lunch here It was our first stop We throughly enjoyed it This eatery is environmentally conscious and minimalistic in waste Compostable to go containers are used for to go items and regular washable plates bowls and utensils are used for dining in There was one communal table and a few smaller tables inside and a small patio area outside in front The menu filled with yummy plant-based options adorned the wall as you walk in Choices included smoothies Acai bowls wraps Buddha bowls salads toasts sides shots teas and kombuchas A huge selection of pastries on display behind glass were also available They also had a menu option for dogs We chose the Berry Bliss Acai Bowl and the Bohemian Soul Bowl The Acai bowl came out in a reasonable amount of time The Buddha bowl took a little longer Both presented well with plenty of bright colors and tasted great Prices were a little high but well worth the price The ingredients were fresh healthy and locally grown and/or brought in Service was friendly and helpful We have a few more days in Vancouver We will definitely visit Buddha-full again before we leave,Tama Organic Life
Josephine W.,2020-03-08,4,I dropped in to Buddhafull during the Hot Chocolate Festival as I was curious about their mushroom hot chocolate The shop is inviting and cute with lots of greenery and wood accents The drink I had was called Ancient Wisdom a raw dark hot chocolate with adaptogenic healing mushrooms and a light spice The rim had some sweet spices that was delicious I love dark hot chocolate and I could taste the mushrooms It worked quite well I would come back to try some of their other dishes Lots of healthy items on their menu,Tama Organic Life
Meredith D.,2021-03-01,4,Have been in here a couple times and hadnt reviewed Recently grabbed take out from here with a couple immunity boosting drinks and ramen bowl Ill admit that vegan/vegetarian doesnt usually excite me but it hit the spot and definitely something we will shortlist going forward,Tama Organic Life
Jessica W.,2019-11-28,4,Popped in as I was walking the neighborhood and looking for a healthy option A great storefront selling lots of local items so I loved looking around and finding some new local artisans Went to order and the person working the till seemed very friendly but during the lunch hour rush with a long line they were chatting long periods with each customer as I was about 4th in line when I went to order and many more coming in during my wait I get friendlyness but during the rush period on a weekday was a little frustrated Then it took over 15 minutes for the avo toast I ordered so I finally had to ask for it to go as I was due back for work and no longer had time to stay and eat The avo toast itself was wonderful  really great mix not just slabbing avocado on some bread so it was worth the long wait in the end and will go back in the future for sure just making sure I get myself a little extra time And the fact it came in a heart well that was overly adorable Also they had some amazing vegan desserts wish I picked one up,Tama Organic Life
Brittany F.,2019-11-04,2,Ive been a loyal customer of Buddha-Full for years Back in the day it was somewhat of a cult following for yogis and health junkies but has recently become popular among the broader Vancouver crowd Im usually sucked into their Lobo smoothie and mint Nanaimo bar which are inconsistent in quality but good for the most part Today I decided to venture outside of the norm and have to say it was regrettable I got the pumpkin smoothie which is fine tastes like blended pumpkin pie and is overwhelmingly spiced with nutmeg The mistake was the raspberry cheesecake which was so stale I was pretty dissatisfied so I brought it back to the counter and the employee seemed annoyed by my complaint I asked to exchange it for a different dessert that was actually a lower price than what I paid but she said I had to get the same cheesecake I reluctantly agreed This second slice was even more rock hard than the first see picture I took one bite and left the rest Theres so many great healthy cafes and smoothie spots in Van now I dont see the point in coming back to here with that type of oversight and customer service Might have to leave you as a memory Bye-da-full wave-emoji,Tama Organic Life
Nina S.,2019-05-31,3,I enjoyed everything here and feel great after eating clean but the prices are very high for the portions Value 2/5 Atmosphere 4/5 Service 3/5 Quality 4/5 13/20,Tama Organic Life
Joyce L.,2019-08-23,5,I happened upon this cafe while I was in search for Two Daughters whose storefront appeared to be closed There was a sign on the fence indicating they were still accepting special orders so they were definitely still open for business I ran into some ladies who were looking to get pastries at the same shop and they let me know that Buddha-full also sold their goods and walked me there The decor of Buddha-full was super cute I didnt have a chance to Yelp this place prior to going so I wasnt studied up on this cafe I was happy to learn this place was fully vegan and there were just so many sweets and pastries to choose from Since this was a healthier place it appeared most of the sweets were sweetened with dates and natural sweeteners vs straight-up sugar The girl at the register was very helpful in recommending things to try I got the Mango Cheesecake Bar Sunflower Seed Bar and Golden Milk I think thats what it was called Everything was so good I also appreciated not having to pay extra for non-dairy milk Yay The sweets had just a hint of sweetness so they werent overpowering or exhausting Since they were made of whole food ingredients I found them to be quite filling and it took me quite a bit of picking at them throughout the day to finally finish them I wasnt even able to finish them after a hard run at Grouse Grind they were very filling I definitely will come back here the next time Im in Vancouver,Tama Organic Life
Del A.,2018-05-19,3,My friends and I decided to visit this spot because we were in the North Van area and had seen pictures of the interior of this place Although we expected it to be more expensive than most places we were shocked to find out that all of their smoothies were 11 While they have a lot of options to choose from and the portion sizes are pretty large I still felt that it was a lot to shell out for a smoothie Regardless I ordered the Green Guru smoothie with cold-pressed apple juice + mango + spinach + pineapple + dates and thought it was good but nothing spectacular The staff is all lovely and friendly as well which is always a plus My favourite part of this café would have to be the interior  its one of the most aesthetic cafes that Ive been to and they even have adorable swings definitely instaworthy That being said I recommend coming once if you want a cute spot to have a smoothie and take shameless pics for the Insta but I probably wouldnt come back a second time given the steep prices,Tama Organic Life
