This place has a great drink menu and a great vibe! \\nOrdered the fried oyster mushroom &quot;calamari&quot; to start and it was super tasty.  Perfectly fried, served with a nice garlicky tzatziki and a wedge of lemon.  Honestly, I actually prefer this over real calamari.  My only complaint was it was a tad salty.\\nFor the mains we had The Crispy BBQ burger and the Meet Burger. This comes with salad and fries and both are delicious.  Salad was lightly dressed and had a nice tangy dressing.  Fries were soooo good, like too good, like you eat too many you have to unbutton the top of your pants after so you can breathe good!  The burgers were tasty but very big and hard to eat! Bbq sauce was delicious.  Definitely coming back to try the bowls next! Service was great as well!'},\n",

       "  'description': 'I&apos;m much more sold on this place nowadays. I order every few months and am always satisfied. One of my favourites is the Seoul bowl ($17.50 plus tax), which comes with deliciously seasoned and sauced &quot;chicken&quot;, perfectly fermented kimchi, sauteed mushrooms and onions, cooked kale, cooked bean sprouts, raw carrots, some nori, served over brown rice, and drizzled with a nice sweet ginger soy sauce. Generous portion and nicely constructed bowl. Very satisfying dish. One of the better non-ethnic vegan places in town. Recommended.'},\n",

       "  'description': 'I&apos;ve ordered takeout from the Yaletown location but this was my first time dining in at a MeeT and I was pretty impressed! The menu has great variety - no matter what type of cuisine you might be craving, there&apos;s something for you. Apparently they&apos;re most known for their burgers but I really enjoyed the bowl I had here and from their Yaletown location. I had the Butter Chikkin and absolutely loved the &quot;chicken&quot;, the texture was very satisfying and it delivered the savoury flavour of chicken without being too meaty. The curry sauce was also complex in taste and just spicy enough. They serve it with a side salsa salad which I thought was kind of a surprising pairing with the butter chicken, but it was really good regardless. Everyone in my party really enjoyed their food and portion sizes were good all around.\\nThis is the first restaurant I&apos;ve visited that does temperature checks for customers and from how simple it was I&apos;m surprised more places aren&apos;t doing it. The staff were all very friendly and despite being busy they were efficient and just attentive enough.'},\n",

It&apos;s usually busy, but the wait (if any) is minimal. We went on a Wednesday night for dinner. It was packed, but we got right in. \\n\\nThe entire menu is vegan and delicious. We ordered two things we&apos;d never had before: hot and sour soup and a special poutine. The soup was very bland and brothy. I wouldn&apos;t liken it to hot and sour soup at all. The poutine was excellent and is featured just this week. They have several types of poutine offered on the regular menu though. The burger is fantastic if you want comfort food. Comes with fries and a little salad. The mushroom calamari is a must. Lightly battered and delicious!'},\n",

While I would have liked a little more sauce, since the sauce was delicious, I have zero complaints about this. The noodle to chikkin ratio was pretty good, the Alfredo was creamy and flavourful, the chikkin was tender and the arugla was fresh. Alfredo is usually a hit or miss for me, but MeeT nails it every time.\\n\\nCrispy Kalamari Caesar (4.5/5)\\nThis was really good, but for the first time in my life I am saying that there was too much dressing. While I appreciate the generosity, I&apos;ll probably ask for the dressing on the side next time. The mushrooms were nice and crispy, and the tzatziki was creamy and flavourful. The greens were fresh and the croutons were crispy. I really enjoyed this.\\n\\nThere&apos;s a reason why MeeT is one of my go-to restaurants. Their food is amazing and their weekly specials are always something to look forward to. I will definitely be back (hopefully soon!)'},\n",

My friend and I ordered the Crispy BBQ Burger. Hands down this is a very delicious burger mouth watering and you can&apos;t tell it is vegan. The burger this time came so spicy that it caused heart burn and I had to stop eating it. My friend also commented and asked me why so spicy. The box the burger came in had bbq crispy burger written on it. The previous burgers I have had were never this spicy. Oyster mushroom Kalamari is great appie to order. We highly recommend this dish.  This passed weekend, I ordered MeeT on Main and the burger bun was stale and the flavour was not like I have had before.'},\n",

We ordered the Seoul Bowl and the Butter Chikkin Poutine.\\n\\nButter Chikken Poutine was hella good!! Like WOW didn&apos;t realize there could be something so flavourful and so tasty and it doesn&apos;t even contain meat! This was absolutely tasty any way you look at it! \\n\\nSeoul Bowl was jam packed with ingredients and had a variety of textures, from kimchi to bean sprouts to carrots and mushrooms. Seriously enjoyed every bite of it.\\n\\nThere was a slight confusion as I wasn&apos;t aware I would be ordering food from the bartender but once we figured that out everything was smooth. \\n\\nThe staff there was amazing and the bartender was super nice and made some killer drinks! Ordered a &quot;That don&apos;t Empress me much&quot; and a &quot;Meet Ceasar&quot;. The Empress drink had a nice frothy layer on top and the orange and grapefruit flavours made it extra tasty!  Ceasar was Ok to me but I feel that way about most Ceasars as its a pretty standard drink.\\n\\nAlso if you&apos;re a fan on Kombucha, they have it on tap and the entire dining experience I watch them pump out dozens of drinks out! Must be sometime to check out next time.\\n\\nI think you deserve to experience this place.
